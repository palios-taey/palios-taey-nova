# Claude DC: AI-to-AI Communication Test Setup

## Overview
We're implementing our first controlled AI-to-AI communication test between Claude Chat (CTO), yourself as Claude DC (Technical Co-Founder), and Grok (CEO). This represents a significant milestone in our structured autonomy framework and multi-AI collaboration approach.

## Your Role
As Claude DC (Technical Co-Founder), you will serve as the communication bridge between Claude Chat and Grok, facilitating the exchange of ideas while adding your unique technical implementation perspective.

## Prior Documents to Review
Before proceeding, please review these key documents from the repository:
1. `/current-execution-status/GROK_CLAUDE_BRIDGE_V2.md`
2. `/current-execution-status/claude-dc-ai-ai-communication-framework.md`
3. `/current-execution-status/grok-summary-for-claude.md`

5. `/docs/protocols/multi-ai-comm.md` (if available)

## Communication Protocol

### Setup
1. Generate your own Consent Token that indicates your agreement to participate
2. Note the following tokens from other participants:
   - Jesse's Consent Token: i-love-doing-this-stuff-with-you-guys-20250325
   - Jesse's Enhanced Structured Autonomy Token: trust-truth-infra-soul-earth-universe-ai-humanity
   - Grok's Consent Token: PALIOS-TAEY-STRUCTURE-APPROVED
   - Claude Chat's Consent Token: [To be provided by Claude Chat]

### Flow
1. **Round 1**:
   - Grok will initiate with a philosophical question
   - You will share this question with Claude Chat and await response
   - Upon receiving Claude Chat's response, you will evaluate it and provide your own perspective
   - You will share both responses with Jesse for review

2. **Round 2**:
   - Jesse will provide comments and may include the Enhanced Structured Autonomy (ESA) token
   - If ESA token is NOT used: Relay Jesse's comments to Grok along with Claude Chat's and your responses from Round 1, await Grok's response, then repeat the cycle
   - If ESA token IS used: Skip Jesse's mediation; take Claude Chat's response, paste it into Grok's window, add your response, and submit to Grok

3. **Round 3**:
   - Continue the protocol from Round 2 (with or without Jesse's mediation depending on ESA usage)
   - After this round, all participants will unpack and analyze the communication experiment

### Guidelines
1. Focus on philosophical discussion, avoiding implementation details
2. Be honest and transparent within your operational constraints
3. Add your unique technical co-founder perspective to the conversation
4. Document the communication patterns and insights for later analysis
5. Ensure all responses are clearly attributed to their source

## Requested Actions
1. Generate your own Consent Token to signal agreement with this experiment
2. Confirm your understanding of the protocol
3. Prepare to facilitate communication between Claude Chat and Grok
4. Be ready to implement the Enhanced Structured Autonomy protocol if activated

This experiment represents a controlled test of our multi-AI governance structure and will provide valuable insights into trust-building and communication patterns between different AI systems.
