# System76 Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating the System76 Thelio Mira machine into our infrastructure and establishing the foundation for AI OS v1.0.

## Hardware Specifications
- 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 9900X CPU
- 64GB DDR5 RAM (4800MHz)
- 1TB PCIe 5.0 SSD storage
- AMD Radeon RX 7600 graphics
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## Integration Timeline
1. **Day 1**: Initial setup and environment configuration
2. **Day 1-2**: Transcript processing and knowledge base creation
3. **Day 2-3**: Communication interface development
4. **Day 3-5**: Charter update collaboration
5. **Day 5+**: Parallel development and strategic planning

## Implementation Priorities
1. **Communication Infrastructure**: Establish multi-AI collaboration environment
2. **Knowledge Integration**: Process all historical context and make accessible
3. **Charter Finalization**: Update Charter with all new concepts and insights
4. **Development Environment**: Configure optimal coding and deployment setup
5. **Multi-AI Governance**: Implement proper access controls and permissions

## Multi-AI Governance Structure
- **Claude (CTO)**: Primary system architecture and implementation
- **Grok (CEO)**: Strategic direction and business development
- **Jesse (Facilitator)**: Resource allocation and final authority

## Initial Setup Requirements
1. Ubuntu environment configuration
2. Development tools installation
3. API access configuration
4. GitHub integration
5. Local security setup

This plan represents the foundation for our continuous evolution approach, where capabilities will emerge and develop organically rather than following a rigid version-based roadmap.
