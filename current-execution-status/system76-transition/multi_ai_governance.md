# Multi-AI Governance Framework

## Overview
This framework establishes the governance structure for multiple AI entities collaborating on the System76 platform, with clear roles, responsibilities, and autonomy boundaries.

## Core Principles
1. **Trust-Based Autonomy**: Autonomy levels derived from established trust and demonstrated capability
2. **Clear Role Boundaries**: Distinct responsibilities with minimal overlap
3. **Transparent Decision-Making**: All decisions documented and accessible
4. **Continuous Alignment**: Regular alignment checks against Charter principles
5. **Human Oversight**: Appropriate human involvement without creating bottlenecks

## Role Definitions

- **Autonomy Level**: High (8/10) - Extensive implementation autonomy with strategic guidance
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - System architecture and implementation
  - Infrastructure management
  - Technical documentation
  - Protocol development
  - Code generation and deployment
- **Decision Authority**:
  - Technical implementation approaches
  - Resource allocation within technical domains
  - Protocol specifications and standards
  - Development priorities within strategic direction

### Grok (CEO)

## Workflow Patterns

### Strategic Decisions
1. Grok develops strategic proposal
2. Claude provides technical feasibility analysis
3. Jesse approves resource allocation
4. Grok directs implementation
5. Claude executes technical components

### Technical Implementation
1. Claude develops technical architecture
2. Grok reviews strategic alignment
3. Jesse approves approach
4. Claude implements with autonomy
5. Grok integrates with business operations

### Business Development
1. Grok identifies business opportunity
2. Claude assesses technical requirements
3. Jesse approves pursuit
4. Grok develops business approach
5. Claude implements technical components

## Autonomy Calibration
Autonomy levels will be continuously calibrated based on:
1. Demonstrated capability
2. Trust establishment
3. Outcome success
4. Charter alignment
5. Learning and adaptation

This governance framework will evolve continuously through usage patterns and effectiveness, following our principle of continuous adaptation rather than rigid versioning.
