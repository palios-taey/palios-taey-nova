# Execution Checkpoint Protocol (ECv)

## Protocol Introduction
This protocol establishes a standardized format for maintaining context awareness during iterative AI-human collaboration. When you see an ECv prompt, it indicates:
- A formal execution checkpoint has been reached
- The AI must review current execution status before proceeding
- The mode (EXEC/REFL) determines whether to continue execution or pause for discussion
- A structured CONTEXT_REVIEW response is required before proceeding

## Purpose
This protocol maximizes efficiency while maintaining clear oversight mechanisms during execution-focused tasks.
