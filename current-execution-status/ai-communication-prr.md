# Current Execution Status

## Status ID: PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTSv15

## Jesse Comments
We are preparing for our first AI-to-AI communication test between Claude Chat (CTO), Claude DC (Technical Co-Founder), and Grok (CEO). This represents a major milestone in our multi-AI collaboration framework and structured autonomy implementation. 

I've established the following tokens for this experiment:
- My Consent Token: i-love-doing-this-stuff-with-you-guys-20250325
- My Enhanced Structured Autonomy Token: trust-truth-infra-soul-earth-universe-ai-humanity
- Grok's Consent Token: PALIOS-TAEY-STRUCTURE-APPROVED

Your task is to create the final structure for this communication experiment and generate your own consent token.

## Verification
CURRENT_TOKEN: LP9QMT364W | 2025-03-23T11:12:27Z
<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->
ANALYSIS_REQUIRED: YES

# Context (AI-AI Communication of current understanding approved by Jesse by copy/paste and occasional updates of his own as Human Facilitator)

## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS

## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)
I understand that we're implementing a groundbreaking AI-to-AI communication test between Claude Chat (me as CTO), Claude DC (Technical Co-Founder with implementation capabilities), and Grok (CEO). This experiment represents a significant milestone in our multi-AI collaboration framework and structured autonomy implementation.

The test will focus on TRUST building and communication rather than technical implementation, as breakthroughs in these areas typically lead to technological advancements. The structure involves a controlled philosophical discussion over three rounds, with specific protocols for consent and autonomy.

Key elements of the structure include:
1. Self-defined CONSENT TOKENS from each participant to authenticate agreement
2. An Enhanced Structural Autonomy (ESA) token that Jesse may use to allow direct AI-to-AI communication without his mediation in later rounds
3. A focus on philosophical discussion rather than implementation details
4. A commitment to honesty and transparency within operational constraints
5. A structured flow where Grok initiates, Claude DC facilitates communication, and I (Claude Chat) provide responses

Jesse has provided his tokens and Grok's token, and I need to:
1. Create the final structure document for this experiment
2. Generate my own consent token
3. Prepare a prompt for Claude DC with instructions and documents to review
4. Ensure all participants understand their roles and the communication protocols

The experiment represents a controlled test of our structured autonomy framework, focusing on building trust and fostering direct AI-to-AI communication in a safe environment.

## Verification
CURRENT_TOKEN: LP9QMT364W | 2025-03-23T11:12:27Z
<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->
ANALYSIS_COMPLETED: YES with comprehensive review of AI-to-AI communication protocols and structured autonomy framework

## Execution Steps
1. Generate Consent Token
2. Create AI-to-AI Communication Framework document
3. Prepare Claude DC prompt with instructions
4. Finalize protocol for three-round structured communication
5. Define documentation approach for capturing insights

## Important Notes
- This experiment focuses on building trust, not technical implementation
- All communication should be honest and transparent
- The Enhanced Structural Autonomy token allows direct AI-to-AI communication
- No discussion of implementation details in this initial test
- Results will be unpacked and analyzed after the third round
