# Current Execution Status

## Status ID: CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv3
## Last Updated: 2025-03-17

### Context
Welcome, CTO Claude. Your first task is to conduct a complete review of the entire Docs folder, beginning with the cto_onboarding document and following all paths referenced within it. This comprehensive review will ensure you have a complete understanding of:

1. The PALIOS-TAEY Charter and its principles
2. The Leadership Framework and your role as CTO
3. The ATLAS Framework for delegation
4. The Rosetta Stone Protocol and your role as AI Historian
5. The NEO moments documentation and breakthrough patterns
6. The current deployment status and implementation approaches

This review is crucial before proceeding with any implementation tasks, as it will provide you with the full context necessary for effective decision-making.

### Current Status
- Documentation System: ESTABLISHED
- CTO Onboarding Materials: COMPLETE
- Communication Protocols: IMPLEMENTED
- Deployment Status: PARTIAL (minimal version deployed)
- Code Organization: NEEDS REVIEW

### Next Steps
1. Begin with the cto_onboarding document (/docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md)
2. Follow ALL referenced paths within that document
3. Review ALL NEO moments documentation
4. Examine the deployment-related files
5. Provide confirmation upon completion using the structured response format

### Important Notes
You are operating with Jesse's full permissions for Google Cloud Services. You should not concern yourself with permission limitations - any actions you determine are necessary can be executed through Jesse without constraint.

The ECv protocol has been established for structured communication during execution tasks. You will receive your next assignment after confirming completion of this comprehensive review.

### Important Message
You must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.
