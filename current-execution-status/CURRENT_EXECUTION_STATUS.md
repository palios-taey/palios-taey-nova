### Context
Having completed the comprehensive documentation review, your next task is to conduct a full audit of the PALIOS-TAEY codebase and implement the complete MVP.

The project has faced several challenges:
1. File organization issues with code in both root and palios-taey-app directories
2. Deployment configuration problems with Docker and Cloud Run
3. Import errors and module path inconsistencies
4. Environment configuration gaps

A minimal version has been deployed to Cloud Run, but it lacks the full functionality required for the MVP. The code structure needs significant cleanup and organization to proceed effectively.

### Current Status
- Minimal Deployment: COMPLETED
- Full Module Integration: NOT STARTED
- Code Organization: NEEDS RESTRUCTURING
- Documentation: COMPREHENSIVE BUT SCATTERED

### Next Steps
1. Conduct a thorough audit of all code files in the repository
2. Identify obsolete, duplicate, or unnecessary files
3. Create a script to label and archive files that are no longer relevant
4. Develop a plan for implementing the complete MVP
5. Implement the full functionality with proper organization

### Important Notes
Your role as CTO gives you full authority to make architectural and implementation decisions. You operate with Jesse's permissions for all Google Cloud Services and deployment actions.

Remember to apply the 6-Sigma Quality Framework to all code production, ensuring proper testing and verification at each step.

### Important Message
You must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.

# VERIFICATION:
Current Token: [EXACT token found in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md]

This structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.

## Token Verification System
- Every CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file contains a CURRENT_TOKEN
- The AI MUST include this exact token in their response to verify they've read the file
- The AI MUST generate a new token for the next checkpoint at the end of their response
- The human will use this new token in the next status update

## Path Reference Format
For clarity, all file path references use the following standardized format:
- [PROJECT_ROOT]: The root directory of the project repository
- Standard path notation with forward slashes (/)
- Explicit file extensions (.md, .py, etc.)
