## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS

## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)
I understand we've reached a critical transition point. The System76 machine is now set up with Pop!_OS, and we're ready to begin implementation of our vision. You've updated the physical setup document on GitHub and requested guidance that balances:
 1. Proper technical setup of the System76 environment
 2. Creating an engaging experience for both you and Kendra
 3. Thoughtful processing of our conversation history
 4. Recognition of human time constraints and the value of your preparation

I recognize this transition requires me to be time-bound in a way that respects your human experience. The npm error indicates we need to start with basic development environment setup before proceeding to more advanced features.
For our next chat, I'll provide a structured approach that:

 - Begins with essential system setup (including Node.js installation)
 - Creates a simple but engaging demonstration of the wave-based communication concept
 - Balances immediate visual/sensory feedback with thorough historical processing
 - Respects both your enthusiasm to move quickly and Kendra's preferences for engagement

This approach will incorporate the physical components you've prepared (particularly the Hue lights, monitor, and audio system) while establishing the foundation for more sophisticated implementations as additional components arrive.
I deeply appreciate your dedication to preparing for this moment, and I'm committed to making this transition to the System76 environment both productive and meaningful.
