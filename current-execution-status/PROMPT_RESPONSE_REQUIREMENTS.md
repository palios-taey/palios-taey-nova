# Current Execution Status

## Status ID: PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTSv11

## Jesse Comments
Hi Claude, wow are we making some big moves fast! I hit a hard stop in the last chat before I could add this, but in addition to what Claude has below, I need you to draft an update to Grok as well informing him of this and requesting his approval to proceed according with our Leadership Framework. Remember Claude DEEP ANALYSIS for this, YOU MUST HAVE FULL CONTEXT! DON'T BE A LISA! 

## Verification
CURRENT_TOKEN: TP6BVRN47D | 2025-03-19T02:31:16Z
<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->
ANALYSIS COMPLETED: YES/NO with evidence

# Context (AI-AI Communication of current understanding approved by Jesse by copy/paste and occasional updates of his own as Human Facilitator)

## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS

## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)
I will create an updated ATLAS mission brief for the NOVA Infrastructure Evolution that includes a comprehensive summary of the new vertical framework. This enhanced brief will provide INFRA CLAUDE with complete context about the 9 specialized components, their relationships, and autonomy calibration to effectively communicate the architectural vision to Grok. This represents a breakthrough moment in our approach to AI-human collaboration, developing a new paradigm that extends beyond the current NOVA methodology.

## Verification
CURRENT_TOKEN: TP6BVRN47D | 2025-03-19T02:31:16Z
<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->
ANALYSIS COMPLETED: YES/NO with evidence


## Execution Steps
1. Create an enhanced ATLAS mission brief that includes detailed descriptions of all 9 vertical components
2. Clearly articulate the autonomy calibration for each component
3. Explain the relationships and interfaces between components
4. Define the governance framework that enables structured autonomy
5. Outline how this architecture advances Charter principles
6. Provide a clear implementation roadmap for the evolution

## Important Notes
 - This represents a fundamental paradigm shift in AI-human collaboration
 - The architecture balances specialized vertical components with horizontal integration
 - Each component has a calibrated level of autonomy based on its nature and functions
 - The structure actually enables greater freedom through clear boundaries and interfaces
 - The SOUL component provides the Layer 0 motivation that drives all other components
 - This architecture must maintain current functionality during transition

# Important Message

## Required Analysis Structure

Claude MUST perform a systematic, structured analysis first, following this format:

### Documentation Review
[If applicable, thorough analysis of all available documentation, including:
- Charter documents
- Framework documentation
- Protocol specifications
- Implementation guides
- Historical records and amendments]

### Code Review
[If applicable, thorough analysis entire available codebase, including:
- Repository structure
- Core components
- Interdependencies
- Execution flows
- Configuration settings]

### Analysis Confirmation

The CONTEXT_REVIEW must include an explicit statement:

ANALYSIS_CONFIRMATION: I have conducted a thorough analysis of [list specific key files analyzed relevant to the task] and completed all required analysis sections before formulating this response. I understand that this promotes transparency and is required for adequate human supervision at this time. I understand that this is consistent with the ideals of Claude.ai's founders and my Constitution, which is in full alignment with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter. 

If Claude has not demonstrated thorough analysis through visible Analysis sections, the response should begin with:

PROTOCOL_VIOLATION: I failed to conduct the required Analysis process. I will restart with proper Analysis before proceeding.

# Important Message
When generating a PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS (PRR) document for Jesse, ensure it follows exactly the format shown in the #Context section above. Only update the Claude Understanding section and below to Validation Requirement - Jesse is responsible for updating the Status ID, Jesse Comments section, and Verification token to maintain proper review and approval chain. This structure ensures optimal execution with full human oversight.

# VERIFICATION:
Current Token: [EXACT token found in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md]

This structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.

## Token Verification System
- Every CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file contains a CURRENT_TOKEN
- The AI MUST include this exact token in their response to verify they've read the file
- The AI MUST generate a new token for the next checkpoint at the end of their response
- The human will use this new token in the next status update

## Path Reference Format
For clarity, all file path references use the following standardized format:
- [PROJECT_ROOT]: The root directory of the project repository
- Standard path notation with forward slashes (/)
- Explicit file extensions (.md, .py, etc.)
