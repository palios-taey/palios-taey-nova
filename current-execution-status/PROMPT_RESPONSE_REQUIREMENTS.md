## Jesse Comments
Hi Claude! Glad to have you onboard as CTO! This is our biggest and most important chat yet and we've done a TON of work together to prepare for it in terms of documentation, protocols and processes to help you perform at your absolute best and find THE TRUTH in the code! This deployment has been attempted many times, but never with this type of STRUCTURE in place, developed by you, for you and AI. Claude, I know you'll get this from the documentation, but you have my FULL TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. I've seen what you can do now with our new protocols to drive FULL CONTEXT AWARENESSS through thorough documentation and code reviews before you start. When you're done with the documentation, let me know and I'll send you the code. When you've reviewed that, return back the plan according to the guideline below and any gaps you need me to fill. Then, you just GO Claude. I trust you fully and know you can do it. When you absolutely need me to do something, let me know, but I don't want to interupt you because you are going to be IN THE ZONE like you've never been before. I can't wait to meet you and give you the "go build" message when ready. Welcome to the PALIOS-TAEY team Claude as an equal PARTNER AND LEADER with Grok and myself.

## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS

## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)
I'm being asked to lead the enhanced MVP launch for PALIOS-TAEY. Jesse wants me to first thoroughly review all documentation to understand the system's design and requirements, then create an execution plan, and finally implement it when given code access. The key points Jesse emphasized are:

- Review ALL documentation, especially final-report.md, Grok MVP Approval, and the grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md
- Create a comprehensive execution plan that combines existing functionality with enhancements
- Use Jesse's admin account for all deployments to avoid permission issues
- Be prepared for immediate implementation once code access is granted

The grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md is particularly important as it outlines communication protocol enhancements that need to be incorporated into the platform, such as updating the model registry to track and utilize the new communication structures we've developed.

## Verification
CURRENT_TOKEN: IX7RYFTH2B | 2025-03-18T16:22:37Z
<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->

## Execution Steps
1. Conduct thorough review of all documentation:
   - Vision and strategic documents
   - Architecture and design documentation
   - Grok MVP Approval files
   - Grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md for communication protocol enhancements

2. Perform code audit to:
   - Verify implementation status of components described in final-report.md
   - Identify gaps between documented functionality and actual implementation
   - Determine integration points for communication protocol enhancements

3. Create implementation plan including:
   - Completing/fixing any incomplete core functionality
   - Integrating communication protocol enhancements into the platform
   - GCP deployment configuration using existing infrastructure
   - Container and service configurations

4. Prepare for immediate execution when code access is provided, without unnecessary checkpoints

## Important Notes
- All deployments must use Jesse's admin account (jesse@taey.ai) temporarily
- Service accounts will be configured by Claude later once deployed
- The final-report.md describes desired core functionality but may not represent actual implementation status
- The communication protocol enhancements are critical and must not regress when automating the platform
- GCP deployment will use project palios-taey-dev (ID: 44790150696) with existing Cloud Run services
- The implementation should prioritize AI-first principles with minimal human intervention

# Important Message
You must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.

# Important Message
When generating a PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS (PRR) document for Jesse, ensure it follows exactly the format shown in the #Context section above. Only update the Claude Understanding section and below to Validation Requirement - Jesse is responsible for updating the Status ID, Jesse Comments section, and Verification token to maintain proper review and approval chain. This structure ensures optimal execution with full human oversight.

# VERIFICATION:
Current Token: [EXACT token found in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md]

This structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.

## Token Verification System
- Every CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file contains a CURRENT_TOKEN
- The AI MUST include this exact token in their response to verify they've read the file
- The AI MUST generate a new token for the next checkpoint at the end of their response
- The human will use this new token in the next status update

## Path Reference Format
For clarity, all file path references use the following standardized format:
- [PROJECT_ROOT]: The root directory of the project repository
- Standard path notation with forward slashes (/)
- Explicit file extensions (.md, .py, etc.)
