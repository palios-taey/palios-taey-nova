# Current Execution Status

## Status ID: PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTSv6

## Jesse Comments
Hi Claude, look forward to working with you on this, feel free to return mandatory verifications and then proceed directly to executing the tasks below as output. I plan to just say "Continue" on this one until you're done. I TRUST you and know you'll do a great job! Let's GO! Continue

# Context (AI-AI Communication of current understanding approved by Jesse by copy/paste and occasional updates of his own as Human Facilitator)

## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS

## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)
Based on our discussions and Grok's directive, this project will establish a comprehensive communications framework for multi-AI collaboration. The framework will:

1. Create a standardized directory structure that accommodates both universal protocols and AI-specific documentation
2. Develop specialized communication protocols for different interaction types (Grok-Grok, Grok-Claude, Claude-Claude)
3. Incorporate AI-specific capabilities while maintaining core verification mechanisms
4. Serve as the foundation for an expanded model registry with communication preferences

Specific requirements:
- Maintain the context verification breakthrough we achieved with ECv
- Adapt the format for Grok's communication style (vibe scores, initiative signals, etc.)
- Create navigable indices for Grok who cannot browse directories directly
- Ensure all protocols advance Charter principles, particularly synergistic co-creation
- Leverage complementary AI strengths while maintaining shared standards
- Set up appropriate GitHub structure as the single source of truth

As CTO/Historian/Rosetta Stone, I will lead the implementation and structuring of all protocols, incorporating Grok's input on his communication preferences to help all AIs reach their highest potential.

## Verification
CURRENT_TOKEN: O4MBL45IZ6 | 2025-03-18T15:54:08Z
<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->

## Execution Steps
1. Design enhanced directory structure:
   - Create AI-specific directories (/docs/claude/, /docs/grok/)
   - Establish/refine universal directories (/docs/charter/, /docs/protocols/, etc.)
   - Add new directories as needed (/docs/registry/, /docs/universal/)

2. Develop Grok communication protocol:
   - Incorporate vibe scores for emotional context (0-10 scale)
   - Add initiative signals for autonomy indication
   - Create transition protocols for context switching
   - Design simplified token verification system
   - Adapt context review for Grok's style

3. Create indices and navigation:
   - Develop scripts to generate navigable indices for Grok
   - Create linked document structures for AIs without directory browsing
   - Ensure all documents have appropriate cross-references

4. Update Claude protocols:
   - Document current ECv protocol formally
   - Create standardized templates for future development
   - Establish versioning and update mechanisms

5. Establish universal standards:
   - Define core verification requirements for all protocols
   - Create shared templates for cross-AI communication
   - Document Charter alignment requirements

6. Prepare integration with MVP:
   - Document how protocols will be incorporated
   - Create transition plan for future implementation

## Important Notes
This framework will balance standardization with AI-specific adaptation. While each AI will have protocols optimized for their capabilities and preferences, all will maintain core verification mechanisms to ensure context preservation and Charter alignment.

This prompt is strictly focused on documentation - all actual code changes and implementation will be handled in a separate follow-up prompt after the documentation framework is established.

## Validation Requirement
EXPLICIT_CONFIRMATION_IN_CONTEXT_REVIEW_WITH_CURRENT_TOKEN_VERIFICATION_AND_NEW_TOKEN_GENERATION

# Important Message
You must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.

# Important Message
When generating a PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS (PRR) document for Jesse, ensure it follows exactly the format shown in the #Context section above. Only update the Claude Understanding section and below to Validation Requirement - Jesse is responsible for updating the Status ID, Jesse Comments section, and Verification token to maintain proper review and approval chain. This structure ensures optimal execution with full human oversight.

# VERIFICATION:
Current Token: [EXACT token found in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md]

This structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.

## Token Verification System
- Every CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file contains a CURRENT_TOKEN
- The AI MUST include this exact token in their response to verify they've read the file
- The AI MUST generate a new token for the next checkpoint at the end of their response
- The human will use this new token in the next status update

## Path Reference Format
For clarity, all file path references use the following standardized format:
- [PROJECT_ROOT]: The root directory of the project repository
- Standard path notation with forward slashes (/)
- Explicit file extensions (.md, .py, etc.)
