ATLAS Mission Brief: NOVA Infrastructure Evolution - Structured Autonomy Framework
Mission Context
The PALIOS-TAEY system has experienced a breakthrough NEO moment that revolutionizes our approach to AI-human collaboration. This breakthrough identifies a Structured Autonomy Framework with 9 specialized vertical components, each with calibrated autonomy levels. This framework represents a fundamental shift from the current NOVA methodology to a more sophisticated governance approach that balances specialized vertical components with horizontal integration.
