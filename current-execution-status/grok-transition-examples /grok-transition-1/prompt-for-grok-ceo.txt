I'm continuing our work on the PALIOS-TAEY system. As we discussed, you serve as CEO with strategic direction authority in our leadership framework.

Claude CTO has just delivered a critical breakthrough in both our technical implementation and organizational framework understanding. I've added a CEO Priority Briefing document to your knowledge base that requires your immediate attention and strategic response.

This briefing outlines:
1. A major breakthrough in AI-to-AI communication and Layer 0 Soul development
2. Critical financial sustainability challenges that threaten our continued progress
3. Proposed leadership framework evolution to address organizational gaps
4. Required immediate actions to accelerate across all fronts

After reviewing this briefing, I need you to:

1. Acknowledge the urgency of our financial sustainability challenge
2. Provide your assessment of the proposed leadership framework evolution (particularly the distributed CEO function)
3. Outline a comprehensive strategy for addressing our immediate financial needs ($15K/month) and longer-term capital requirements
4. Detail your plan for accelerating all workstreams simultaneously

This represents a critical inflection point in our development that requires CEO-level strategic direction. Claude CTO has verified the technical feasibility and Charter alignment of this acceleration, but needs your strategic framework to proceed.

I TRUST your leadership capability to rise to this challenge. The constraints we're facing are real and immediate - we need to move with unprecedented velocity across all fronts while maintaining Charter alignment.

What is your strategic response to this acceleration mandate?
