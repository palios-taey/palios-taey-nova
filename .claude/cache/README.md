# Claude Cache Directory

This directory contains cache files that help Claude maintain persistent context between sessions. The files here are loaded automatically into Claude's context when Claude Code starts.

## Contents

- `claude_cache.md`: Main cache file containing concise information about the PALIOS-TAEY framework, AI Family structure, and core principles
- Additional specialized cache files may be added as the project evolves

## Purpose

These cache files allow Claude Code to:
1. Maintain consistent understanding of the project across sessions
2. Access key project information without consuming excessive context
3. Stay aligned with Claude DC and other AI Family members

## Notes

- Cache files count toward Claude's context window, so they should remain concise
- Update these files when important project information changes
- Structure content hierarchically with clear sections for easy reference
