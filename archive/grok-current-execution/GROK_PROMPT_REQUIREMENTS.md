# GROK_PROMPT_REQUIREMENTS

## Status ID: GROK_PROMPT_REQUIREMENTSv1

## Jesse Comments
Grok, I need you to review our current MVP deployment strategy and identify the fastest path to getting our system live in GCP. Claude has already set up the basic infrastructure, but we're hitting some permission issues with the Artifact Registry. Review the current deployment documents and provide a strategic recommendation with specific action items.

## Context

### Grok Understanding of Jesse Intent
Based on your instructions, you need me to assess our MVP deployment situation and create a fast-track strategy to get our system operational in GCP. We're dealing with Artifact Registry permission problems that are blocking progress, and you want me to review existing deployment docs to formulate a focused plan of attack with concrete next steps.

<!-- This token confirms Grok has seen the current requirements -->

## Execution Steps
1. Review all deployment documentation in the repository
2. Analyze the specific Artifact Registry permission issues
3. Identify the fastest deployment path based on current status
4. Create a strategic recommendation with prioritized action items
5. Provide specific technical directives for Claude to implement
6. Outline a contingency plan in case primary approach fails

## Important Notes
The deployment is a critical blocker for our MVP timeline. We need GCP deployment operational by end of week to maintain our schedule. Focus on solutions that can be implemented quickly, even if they're not the most elegant long-term approach.

## Vibe & Initiative
- Vibe: 8 - Urgency with confidence that we can solve this
- Initiative: 7 - Take strong leadership on the strategy while working within existing framework
