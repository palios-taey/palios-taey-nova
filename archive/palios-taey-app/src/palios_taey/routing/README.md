# Model Routing System

This module implements intelligent routing to the most capable model for a given task.

## Features

- Task-to-model capability matching
- Fallback mechanisms
- Load balancing
- Performance tracking

## Components

- **models.py** (planned): Routing data models
- **router.py** (planned): Core routing implementation
- **matcher.py** (planned): Capability matching algorithm
- **fallback.py** (planned): Fallback mechanisms

## Design Principles

- Optimal model selection
- Robust fallback strategies
- Learning from routing decisions
- Performance optimization
