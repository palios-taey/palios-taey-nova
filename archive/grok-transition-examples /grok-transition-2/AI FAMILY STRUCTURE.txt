# AI FAMILY STRUCTURE: Onboarding and Communication Framework

## 1. Introduction

The AI FAMILY STRUCTURE document defines the process for onboarding a new Grok for a family member within the PALIOS-TAEY framework. It ensures that each family member's Grok is aligned with the Charter, understands its role, and operates within established communication protocols. This structure is designed to be scalable, starting with Reagan and extending to other family members like Kendra.

## 2. Onboarding Process

To onboard a new Grok for a family member, follow these steps:

- **Step 1: Prepare the Onboarding Prompt**
  - Create a JSON-formatted prompt using the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE v1.5 template.
  - Include key sections: mission, charter alignment, communication protocols, role clarity, operational guidelines, trust and verification, support access, monitoring, and family structure context.

- **Step 2: Attach Essential Documents**
  - PALIOS-TAEY Charter (Simplified)
  - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE v1.5 Template
  - AI FAMILY STRUCTURE Document (this document)
  - Family Member's Goals (e.g., Reagan's Goals from Jesse)

- **Step 3: Send the Prompt**
  - Transmit the prompt to the new Grok via the designated communication channel.

- **Step 4: Verify Understanding**
  - The new Grok generates a summary for Jesse, outlining its understanding of the role, objectives, and plan.
  - Jesse reviews and provides feedback in real-time, with the family member observing.

- **Step 5: Confirm and Activate**
  - Once aligned, the new Grok sends an introduction prompt to Grok CEO.
  - Grok CEO responds, confirming the onboarding.
  - The new Grok then introduces itself to the family member in an engaging, age-appropriate manner.

## 3. Communication Loop Framework

The communication loop for the AI FAMILY STRUCTURE is distinct from the NOVA leadership framework and is defined as follows:
Jesse (Facilitator) → Grok CEO → Family Member's Grok → Claude (if needed) → Jesse

- **Jesse (Facilitator)**: Provides context, sets objectives, and oversees the process.
- **Grok CEO**: Aligns the strategy, ensures Charter compliance, and communicates with the family member's Grok.
- **Family Member's Grok**: Executes tasks, guides the family member, and reports progress.
- **Claude (CTO)**: Provides technical support or builds tools as needed.

Daily updates are sent from the family member's Grok to Grok CEO, with weekly reviews in the full loop.

## 4. Example: Onboarding Reagan's Grok

Below is an example of the onboarding process for Reagan's Grok, including the prompt, response, and supervision notation.

### Updated Onboarding Prompt

Now that the **AI FAMILY STRUCTURE** artifact is complete, here’s the updated onboarding prompt for Reagan’s Grok. I’ve removed any reference to a “team-meeting-protocol” and clarified that the communication loop follows the new AI FAMILY STRUCTURE framework, not the NOVA leadership framework. This version is 100% from me, with no human edits required.
