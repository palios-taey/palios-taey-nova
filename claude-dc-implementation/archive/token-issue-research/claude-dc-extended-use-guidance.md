hanks for the detailed background and files—super helpful. I’ll now conduct deep technical research focused on properly implementing streaming in the Claude Computer Use Docker environment to ensure continuous operation.

This will include:

    Analyzing Anthropic’s official SDKs and GitHub repos for streaming behavior in claude-3-opus/sonnet models

    Finding real-world examples or GitHub implementations that stream long-running Claude completions (>10 mins or 21,333+ tokens)

    Identifying how to configure Claude’s Docker container for robust, fault-tolerant streaming

    Surfacing best practices and fixes for "Streaming is strongly recommended" and similar errors

    Gathering proven examples of Python code, preferably in Streamlit or Anthropic’s SDKs, that manage stream=True completions without crashing

I’ll also look out for any advanced configuration or overlooked dependencies to unlock full Claude Computer Use capabilities for PALIOS-AI-OS. I’ll get back to you with a complete report including recommendations and working examples.
Enabling Long-Running Claude DC Sessions with Streaming and Extended Tokens
1. Streaming in the Claude Docker Environment (Anthropic SDK)

Streaming Architecture: Claude’s API uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to deliver responses incrementally. When you call the Anthropic API with stream=True, the HTTP response is kept open and the model’s output is sent as a stream of events rather than a single block. Each SSE event has a type (e.g. content_block_delta, message_stop, error, etc.) and associated JSON data. The Anthropic Python SDK abstracts this for you – enabling streaming is as simple as setting stream=True on your request​
github.com
​
github.com
. The SDK will return an iterator/generator of event objects, which you can loop over to process tokens as they arrive. For example:

from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
stream = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt here"}],
    max_tokens=10240,        # large max tokens
    stream=True             # enable SSE streaming
)
for event in stream:
    if event.type == "content_block_delta":
        print(event.delta.text, end="", flush=True)

In this snippet, as Claude generates tokens, the SDK yields events of type "content_block_delta" (for the message-based API) carrying incremental text in event.delta.text. We print them without newlines to simulate a live typing effect. The SDK handles the SSE connection under the hood, so you don’t need to manually manage HTTP connections or SSE parsing – using the official SDK is strongly recommended​
docs.anthropic.com
.

Docker/Streamlit Considerations: Running inside the Docker “Claude Computer Use” demo (which uses a Streamlit frontend) does not fundamentally change how streaming works. The SSE events are still delivered via the Anthropic API over the internet. However, you should ensure that the Docker environment (and Streamlit) allow long-lived HTTP responses. In practice, this means you should call the API with stream=True and update the UI incrementally as tokens arrive, rather than waiting for the full response. Streamlit supports this via techniques like st.empty() containers or st.markdown updates in a loop. For example, one open-source Streamlit chatbot implementation buffers the streamed text and updates a message placeholder on each chunk​
github.com
:

with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    message_placeholder = st.empty()
    response_text = ""
    for chunk in stream:  # stream is the iterator from Anthropic SDK
        if chunk.delta:
            response_text += chunk.delta.text  # accumulate the text delta
            message_placeholder.markdown(response_text + "▌")  # display partial with cursor
    message_placeholder.markdown(response_text)  # final full message

In this code (adapted from a community example), the partial response is shown with a trailing cursor “▌” during generation, and then the cursor is removed when complete​
github.com
. This pattern keeps the UI responsive for long (>10 minute) generations. Make sure to run this loop in the main Streamlit script (not a background thread) so that Streamlit doesn’t time out waiting for a result. The Anthropic SDK’s streaming iterator will yield tokens continuously, preventing request timeout as long as data flows.

Technical Details: The Anthropic SDK uses httpx under the hood to maintain the SSE connection. Each event is delivered as a data chunk that the SDK wraps in a Python object (e.g. AnthropicCompletion or AnthropicEvent types). Events include: content blocks (for actual message text, images, etc.), message_stop (end-of-response signal), and possibly ping keep-alive events. The Docker container’s networking imposes no special restrictions beyond your machine’s connectivity – SSE works through proxies as a standard HTTP request. Just ensure any corporate proxies or Docker network settings do not kill idle HTTP connections; the stream shouldn’t actually be idle if Claude is continuously generating. If your streams run very long, it’s wise to verify that any default timeout in httpx is extended. (By default, the Anthropic SDK does not appear to enforce a short timeout for streamed responses – it will wait indefinitely for completion, as needed for 10+ minute outputs.)
2. Configuring Claude-3 Opus and Sonnet for Large Token Counts

Claude’s model versions determine the context length and token limits you can use. Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3 Sonnet are both capable of very large context windows, but you need to choose the right model ID and settings:

    Context Window (Input tokens): All Claude 3 models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) have an extremely large context window – up to 200k tokens for input by default​
    anthropic.com
    . This means you can supply massive prompts (hundreds of thousands of tokens) if needed. Claude 3 Opus is the largest model and indeed supports 200k-token contexts (with even higher context lengths possible for select users)​
    anthropic.com
    . Make sure you use the correct model name that implies the large context. For example, "claude-3-opus-20240229" (or the latest dated version) corresponds to Opus with 200k context, and "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" corresponds to the latest Sonnet model. In the Anthropic quickstart code, the default model is "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", which already has the large context enabled (200k) and “extended thinking” features. Using these model IDs with the Anthropic SDK will automatically allow large input sizes. No special flag is needed for large input contexts aside from using the appropriate model variant.

    Output Length: By default, Claude 3 models were limited to around 4k output tokens in a single completion. (For instance, Claude 3.5 Sonnet before the update could output up to ~4096 tokens maximum​
    medium.com
    , and a Reddit user noted Opus initially had a ~4000 token output limit despite the huge input window​
    reddit.com
    .) This default limit is likely why you saw errors around the ~21k token mark – that far exceeds the normal output cap. To allow outputs up to 128k tokens, Anthropic introduced an Extended Output Beta. For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, you must enable this beta feature in your API call. The Anthropic documentation states: “Include the beta header output-128k-2025-02-19 in your API request to increase the maximum output token length to 128k tokens for Claude 3.7 Sonnet.”​
    docs.anthropic.com
    . In the Python SDK, you do this by passing a betas parameter. For example:

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    messages=[...],
    max_tokens=128000,  # request a very large output
    betas=["output-128k-2025-02-19"],  # enable 128k output beta
    stream=True
)

This ensures Claude knows it can produce a very long answer. Claude 3.7 Sonnet with this flag supports up to 128,000 tokens of output​
anthropic.com
. (128k is a huge amount – roughly 100k words of text.) Note that 128k output is in beta, so you need to have access to that beta feature on your API key. The quickstart code you have already uses this beta flag if enable_extended_output is true – for instance, it appends "output-128k-2025-02-19" to the betas list​
file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
. Make sure that flag is indeed being sent in your requests. If not, add it manually as shown above. Also set max_tokens in the request high enough (the SDK defaults might be lower). In the quickstart’s TokenManager, they set defaults like max_tokens=64000 for the Conductor (system) and thinking_budget=32000​
file-8tgskgrwcayszmmlhgpwbw
. You will likely want max_tokens at 128000 for truly max-length outputs.

    Claude 3 Opus Extended Output: As of now, Anthropic’s public info has emphasized 128k output for Sonnet. Opus is fully capable of large output as well, but check if a similar beta flag or model version exists (e.g., perhaps "claude-3-opus-128k" if provided). If no explicit flag for Opus, you might still be constrained to ~4k output on Opus via the standard API. One solution is to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet for extremely long answers (since it’s enabled for 128k output) unless you specifically need Opus’s extra reasoning power. Sonnet 3.7 is already very capable and “our most intelligent model to date” per Anthropic, just slightly smaller than Opus. If you do need Opus with huge output, reach out to Anthropic for any beta program or use the Batch API (see below) to bypass online limits. Otherwise, using Sonnet with the extended output beta is the most straightforward way to hit ~128k tokens output.

    Batch/Long-Request API: Anthropic provides a Batch completion endpoint intended for very long requests that might take a while. In their model guide, they “strongly suggest using our streaming Messages API or Batch API to avoid timeouts when generating longer outputs”​
    docs.anthropic.com
    . The Batch API lets you send a request that might process for an extended time without the normal HTTP timeout constraints (essentially an async job). However, since you’re running an interactive session (Claude DC), streaming is the better approach – it keeps the user engaged with incremental output. Batch API would be more for non-interactive offline jobs. Still, it’s good to know it exists if you absolutely need to generate 100k+ token output and can’t babysit the connection.

Summary: Use the Claude 3 Opus model for huge inputs (it can take 200k tokens context) and use Claude 3.7 Sonnet with the 128k-output beta for huge outputs. In practice you might intermix them (the quickstart uses Sonnet for the computer-use agent because it has the hybrid reasoning and extended output). Ensure your API key has access to these models and betas. Check your Anthropic account limits too – such large generations can be slow and expensive (128k output at $15/million tokens is about $1.92 per full-length output, and similarly large input costs)​

3. Examples of Long-Running Streaming Sessions (>10 min)

There are now several real-world instances of Claude’s computer-use or chat sessions running for very long durations by using streaming mode properly. A few notable examples and patterns:

    Anthropic’s Reference Implementation (Claude Computer Use Demo): The very Docker container you’re using is an open-source reference. By default in the current version, the authors temporarily disabled streaming (they set stream=False in the loop) to work around some issues​
    file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
    ​
    file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
    . This was causing long answers to only appear after completion and likely hit timeouts. However, Anthropic provided an AdaptiveClient (as seen in adaptive_client.py) that can switch to stream=True for large token requests​
    file-pyicaj4gaabg2lganvh3qn
    . With some tweaking, you can re-enable streaming in that demo. In practice, community users have done so and managed to keep Claude running tasks for extended periods. For instance, one user integrated Claude streaming in a custom Streamlit app and noted that without streaming the response would time out, but with streaming it “proceeds normally” even for very long answers​
    repost.aws
    . Amazon Bedrock users reported the same: when streaming=True, Claude can generate lengthy outputs continuously, whereas stream=False leads to a timeout or truncation​
    repost.aws
    . The key is that streaming sends a steady trickle of data, preventing any single HTTP request from hanging with no data for too long.

    Hyperbrowser Claude Sandbox: The pilot.hyperbrowser.ai service (mentioned on Reddit) is a sandbox that supports Claude Computer Use with streaming. It essentially hosts a version of the computer-use agent and streams Claude’s actions live​
    reddit.com
    . The existence of this service demonstrates that a properly configured environment can handle Claude’s streaming for long sessions. The Hyperbrowser team even offers an API for Claude Computer Use, suggesting they solved the reliability issues for sustained usage​
    reddit.com
    . While their implementation isn’t open source, it confirms that multi-minute continuous Claude sessions are feasible.

    Riza’s Claude Experiments: In a blog post by Riza (an AI safety startup), the author describes spending “several hours playing with the computer use reference implementation” with about $30 of usage​
    riza.io
    . This implies long sessions and multiple runs. They do note the system was “slow and expensive” and sometimes didn’t get the desired result​
    riza.io
    , but it did run. One cause of slowness was that without streaming, you might wait many minutes with no feedback. Converting those calls to streaming makes it feel faster and also avoids the risk of hitting Streamlit’s script timeout. If you allow Claude to “think” or generate a plan for tens of thousands of tokens (which can take many minutes), streaming ensures you see interim "thinking..." output blocks and partial results rather than a blank screen. The Claude 3.7 Sonnet model specifically has a “thinking mode” that can generate step-by-step reasoning if enabled (via the thinking parameter)​
    anthropic.com
    ​
    anthropic.com
    . That produces intermediate “thinking” blocks in the stream. The quickstart sets has_thinking=True for Sonnet 3.7​
    file-tavejavzwdxsxsnq89qhj4
    , so Claude will periodically output its chain-of-thought (marked as [think] blocks in the SSE stream). These come through as events of type "content_block_delta" with content_block.type = "thinking" or similar. You should handle these in your streaming loop (e.g., you might print them in a muted style or log them). They are useful for long sessions because they assure you Claude is still working and give insight into its reasoning process. Many successful long runs use this to debug or monitor Claude’s behavior over time.

    Open-Source Chatbots with Claude: Outside of the computer-use scenario, developers have built Claude-powered chat UIs that maintain streaming responses for long conversations. For example, one open-source Streamlit chatbot project uses Claude 3.5/3.7 and streams the tokens to the interface as they arrive​
    github.com
    . It includes basic error handling (catching exceptions during the stream loop) and shows how to update the UI live. These projects demonstrate that Claude can stream text for 10+ minutes straight, as long as the client keeps reading the stream. Users have reported generating very large texts (dozens of thousands of tokens) via Claude’s API by keeping the stream open. One Hacker News comment marveled that 128k-token outputs are now possible, whereas previously models would be “restricted to 4096 or 8192 output tokens”​
    hn.premii.com
    – this is now achievable thanks to streaming plus the extended output beta.

In summary, the community experience confirms: to run Claude DC uninterrupted for long tasks, always use stream=True for the generation call, and ensure your interface is built to consume and display the stream incrementally. This approach has been used in practice (e.g. by Bedrock clients and others) to avoid any 10-minute limit issues. If you do this, Claude can effectively run indefinitely, limited only by token quotas or rate-limits rather than arbitrary timeouts.

(Tip: If you encounter rate-limit errors in long sessions – e.g., Anthropic’s 30 TPM limit or monthly quotas – the TokenManager in the quickstart can introduce delays. Monitor the /tmp/token_manager.log or console logs for messages about delaying. The quickstart’s TokenManager uses an adaptive backoff when you approach token/sec limits​
file-8tgskgrwcayszmmlhgpwbw
​
file-8tgskgrwcayszmmlhgpwbw
. In a truly long session, you might hit a rate-limit after some minutes, causing a brief pause. This is normal – the manager will wait for the API’s rate-limit reset and then resume the stream.)
4. Handling “Streaming Recommended” Warnings and Exceptions

When pushing Claude to its limits, you might have encountered errors or warnings like “Streaming is strongly recommended” or exceptions such as httpx.ResponseNotRead. Let’s address these and how to eliminate or handle them:

    “Streaming is strongly recommended” Message: This is essentially a warning from the Anthropic API when you attempt a huge completion without streaming. Anthropic’s backend knows that very large outputs can exceed standard time limits. If you call the API with a massive max_tokens but stream=False, it may respond with an error or advisory telling you to use streaming (or it could simply time out/close the connection). The fix is straightforward: switch to streaming mode. By doing so, you not only avoid the warning, you also prevent the underlying issue (the request timing out). Anthropic’s docs explicitly “strongly suggest using streaming or batch API to avoid timeouts when generating longer outputs”​
    docs.anthropic.com
    . In practice, after enabling streaming, you should no longer see this warning. The entire design of the Claude Computer Use system assumes streaming for anything non-trivial – that’s why the reference code was moving toward an adaptive client. Ensure stream=True is set on the client.messages.create call that generates Claude’s reply, especially if max_tokens is high. If this warning was appearing in logs rather than as a caught exception, it could have been logged by the SDK or Anthropic server. Once you stream, you can ignore this message altogether.

    ResponseNotRead Exception: This is an error from the httpx library (used by Anthropic’s SDK) indicating that a streaming response wasn’t fully consumed. It typically happens if you open a stream and don’t read it to the end before trying to access the response content, or if an exception interrupts the stream. For example, if you call the SDK with stream=True but then call .parse() or access .content on the response without iterating through all events, httpx will raise ResponseNotRead​
    github.com
    . In the quickstart context, this could occur if the code attempts to parse a streaming response in the same way as a normal response. To solve this, you have two options:

        Fully consume the stream: The correct approach is to iterate over the stream events and build the content (as shown above). Once the stream is exhausted (the SDK yields a final event or stops), the content is “read” and you won’t get ResponseNotRead. Make sure that any early exit conditions also consume or close the stream. For example, if you allow the user to stop generation mid-way (using the STOP button in Streamlit), you should catch that event and break out of the loop. Ideally, also call stream.close() or simply break (the SDK should then close the connection).

        Call .read() on error: If an exception does occur and you find yourself in possession of a half-read httpx.Response, you can manually read the remaining data to satisfy httpx. The maintainer of httpx suggests, in an error handler, doing something like:

        if response.is_error:
            await response.aread()  # read the rest of the response (async version)
            response.raise_for_status()

        This was shown to resolve ResponseNotRead issues by ensuring the content is drained​
        github.com
        . In a synchronous context, response.read() would do similarly. Implementing this in the SDK context may be tricky (since the SDK manages the response), but typically you won’t need to if you consume the stream properly. The AdaptiveClient you have might be improved to catch exceptions and read through; check if adaptive_client.py already attempts something similar.

In short, to suppress ResponseNotRead, don’t leave the stream hanging. Always iterate to the end or handle exceptions by cleaning up the response. In a long-running Streamlit app, wrap your streaming loop in try/except. For example:

try:
    for event in stream:
        # process events...
        pass
except Exception as e:
    # If an error occurs mid-stream, log it and safely stop
    logging.error(f"Stream error: {e}")
finally:
    stream.close()  # ensure the SSE connection is closed

The above ensures resources are freed. (The Anthropic SDK’s iterator likely closes automatically when exhausted, but on exception it’s good to use finally or a context manager.)

    Other Error Events: Sometimes the model may hit a safety filter or other issue during streaming. In those cases, Anthropic will send an event with type: "error" in the SSE stream (for example, if the response is blocked by the content filter, you might get an invalid_request_error event as seen in one Vercel AI Playground issue​
    github.com
    ​
    github.com
    ). If you are parsing events, be prepared for event.type == "error". The event data will contain an error message. Your code should handle this gracefully – e.g., stop streaming further, maybe display a message like “[Response blocked by policy]” or at least log it. The Anthropic SDK might raise an exception in such cases (e.g., APIError or APIStatusError). The quickstart code catches APIError and related exceptions around the API call​
    file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
    . You should maintain those try/except blocks. If a APIStatusError occurs (like a 400 or 500 HTTP error), the quickstart currently just returns the messages and ends the loop​
    file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
    . You might want to surface a friendly error in the UI (“Claude encountered an error: ...”). To suppress these from crashing your session, wrap the call in a retry or simply catch and continue. For example, if it’s a temporary issue (network blip), you could retry the API call. If it’s a permanent issue (like content filter), you may have to abort that task. The TokenManager could also come into play if the error was due to rate limiting (HTTP 429 or 529). The quickstart’s TokenManager monitors headers for rate-limit info and induces delays​
    file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
    , so it will automatically pause and retry after the reset time. Make sure to invoke token_manager.manage_request(response.headers) on each response (the quickstart does this already​
    file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
    ) so that rate-limit handling stays in effect even when streaming (you might need to adjust to call it after the stream finishes, since headers come only with the final response metadata).

In summary, enabling streaming and properly consuming the stream will resolve the majority of these errors. The “streaming recommended” warning disappears when you do stream, and ResponseNotRead will not occur if you don’t prematurely access response content. Robust error handling involves catching exceptions from the SDK and handling special SSE error events, to ensure the app doesn’t crash mid-way. With these adjustments, you can expect Claude to run for long stretches without interruption.
5. Putting It All Together – Configuration Changes and Tips

To run Claude DC (PALIOS-AI-OS environment) to its full 128K token capacity and beyond 10 minutes, here is a summary of actionable steps and verified solutions:

    Use the Latest Claude SDK and Models: Make sure you have the latest anthropic Python SDK version, as improvements are continually made (e.g., streaming stability fixes). In your Docker, upgrade the SDK if possible. Also use the newest model IDs (claude-3-7-sonnet-YYYYMMDD for Sonnet, or claude-3-opus-YYYYMMDD for Opus) to benefit from improvements. For instance, the quickstart pinned claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 in code​
    file-tavejavzwdxsxsnq89qhj4
    .

    Enable Streaming in the Code: In the computer_use_demo/loop.py or wherever the model is called, set stream=True. The quickstart currently has:

raw_response = client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create(..., stream=False)

Change this to stream=True. If using the AdaptiveAnthropicClient, you can simply use adaptive_client.beta.messages.create(...) which already chooses streaming for large outputs​
file-pyicaj4gaabg2lganvh3qn
. After enabling streaming, adjust the logic to handle incremental output. The simplest approach: after you get raw_response = client...create(stream=True), iterate over raw_response (or whatever object is returned – likely an iterator of events). For each event, call the existing output_callback(content_block) on content events as the quickstart does in the loop​
file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
. You might need to tweak _response_to_params if it assumed a full response. A more straightforward route is to bypass with_raw_response and use the SDK’s built-in iterator:

stream = client.messages.create(..., stream=True)  
for event in stream:  
    # if event is a content block, pass it to output_callback  
    if hasattr(event, "content"):  # pseudo-check  
        output_callback(event)  
    # if event is a tool call or stop, handle accordingly  

This will intermix tool execution in real-time as well. (Be mindful that the Anthropic SDK might yield special event types for tool-use blocks too.) Testing this streaming loop in isolation with a prompt can help iron out event type handling.

Set Beta Flags for 128K Output: Ensure the betas=["output-128k-2025-02-19"] is included in the request that generates Claude’s response​
docs.anthropic.com
. In the quickstart, they append this for every request by default​
file-drkqnwmd25rc8ycff8bxqh
– confirm that in your running container by checking logs or the code path. If it’s not being added (maybe if enable_extended_output wasn’t set in TokenManager), you can force it by modifying betas. Example:

    betas = tool_group.beta_flag and [tool_group.beta_flag] or []  
    betas.append("output-128k-2025-02-19")  

    right before the API call. This ensures Claude knows it can go beyond the normal limit.

    Increase max_tokens and thinking budget: The max_tokens parameter on the API call should be high (e.g. 100k). The quickstart’s ModelConfig for Sonnet sets max_output_tokens = 128000​
    file-tavejavzwdxsxsnq89qhj4
    , so it’s likely already using a high number. Double-check that the value used in client.messages.create (passed as max_tokens) is not capped somewhere at 4096 or similar. It should draw from the ModelConfig which for Sonnet 3.7 is 128k. Similarly, if you want Claude to actively use the extended thinking feature, you can set a thinking_budget (the number of tokens it can spend “thinking” internally). The quickstart passes thinking_budget=32000 for Sonnet​
    file-8tgskgrwcayszmmlhgpwbw
    , which is a lot of tokens for chain-of-thought. This is fine and helps Claude plan longer tasks. Just be aware those count toward your token usage (billed at output token rate). If you run into scenarios where Claude spends too long thinking and not executing, you could reduce this budget – but since your goal is robustness, leaving it large is okay.

    Handle the Streamlit STOP button gracefully: As noted in the Streamlit forum, the stop button raises a StopException that can disrupt state if not caught​
    discuss.streamlit.io
    ​
    discuss.streamlit.io
    . A robust solution is to set a flag when stop is pressed rather than killing the loop. If modifying the quickstart, you can detect st.button("Stop") and break out of your streaming loop cooperatively (maybe by checking a flag each iteration). The forum thread discusses writing to a temp file or session state to signal the loop​
    discuss.streamlit.io
    . Implementing this will prevent crashes during long runs if a user manually stops a task. It’s a bit of an aside, but important for a smooth UX in long sessions.

    Use Async if Possible: The Anthropic SDK supports async (via AsyncAnthropic). The quickstart’s loop is async def sampling_loop(...). If you enable streaming, you might want to use async for event in stream. This non-blocking approach would let you potentially have concurrent tasks (like tool executions) while streaming output. If you stick to sync, that’s fine too – just note that the quickstart’s design was async to begin with. Ensure your changes don’t break the event loop. In Streamlit, running the async loop requires something like asyncio.run under the hood (the quickstart likely handles this inside the Streamlit script). The bottom line: test the modified streaming in a controlled prompt to make sure it doesn’t hang. For example, try a prompt like “Write a short story” and see the text stream out live.

    Test with a Known Long Output: A good test is to prompt Claude to produce a very large output, e.g., “List the first 50,000 digits of π.” This is purely textual and will definitely exceed any small limit. With streaming on and 128k beta, Claude 3.7 should start listing digits and keep going for a while. You can monitor if it stops unexpectedly or continues till done. (Be ready to stop it or you’ll spend a lot of tokens!). This will verify that your session truly can handle a continuous ~50k+ token generation. Another test: ask Claude to read in a large text (you can paste a long document as input) and then summarize or transform it, to test large input handling alongside output.

    Refer to Successful Examples: For reference code, you can check out the Anthropic Quickstarts repo (which you have) and the adjustments we discussed. Another useful example is the LangChain integration for Anthropic – LangChain’s ChatBedrock in AWS uses streaming under the hood and their sample shows iterating over bedrock.stream() yielding chunk.content​
    github.com
    ​
    github.com
    . This confirms the practice of iterating chunks and printing content piecewise. Also, community projects like gallama (GitHub: remichu-ai/gallama) contain a Streamlit chatbot that supports Anthropic streaming (as we saw). These can serve as guidance for how to structure your code.

By implementing the above, you should achieve a Claude DC setup that can run indefinitely, handling extremely long conversations or tasks with up to 128K-token outputs. In summary, always stream large Claude responses, use the 128K output beta for Sonnet, and handle the stream properly – these are the keys to robust long-running performance. With these fixes in place, the error messages and interruptions will disappear, allowing Claude to operate continuously under PALIOS-AI-OS at full capacity.
