Oh, that's an important clarification! Those are not dollar signs but rather the character "â" (a with circumflex). This completely changes our approach to the problem.

Let me search specifically for this character issue in terminal environments:

Now I understand - those characters are "â" with a circumflex, which indicates a UTF-8 encoding issue in your container environment. This is a classic symptom of terminal encoding problems, where UTF-8 characters are being misinterpreted.

Based on my research, here's what's happening and how to fix it:

## The Problem

The "â" characters you're seeing are a clear sign of UTF-8 encoding being misinterpreted. When terminal emulators receive UTF-8 data but don't interpret it correctly, they typically show multi-byte characters as separate symbols, with the first byte often appearing as "â".

In container environments, this happens because:
1. Docker containers often default to ASCII encoding
2. The locale settings aren't properly configured for UTF-8
3. The terminal emulation in the container isn't matching your host settings

## Solutions

Here are several proven solutions:

### 1. Set Proper Locale Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your container:

```bash
# Add to your Docker run command or docker-compose file
ENV LANG=C.UTF-8
ENV LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
```

You can force the encoding in Docker to UTF-8 by setting the environment variable: "LC_ALL=C.UTF-8"

### 2. Install and Configure Locales in the Container

If you're using an Ubuntu-based container, you'll need to:

```bash
# Add this to your Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y locales
RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE en_US:en
ENV LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8
```

This addresses the issue where "the usual docker images don't specify locales" which causes encoding problems.

### 3. For Testing Claude Code Specifically

Since you're working with Claude Code in this environment, you could create a simple script to run Claude Code with the correct environment settings:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as run-claude-code.sh

# Set proper locale
export LANG=C.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
export TERM=xterm-256color

# Run Claude Code in a specific project directory
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

### 4. For Your Claude DC Implementation

When working on your streaming implementation, make sure to explicitly set the encoding in your Python code:

```python
import sys
import io

# Force UTF-8 encoding for stdout/stderr
sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')
sys.stderr = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stderr.buffer, encoding='utf-8')
```

## Root Cause

The issue is that your terminal is receiving UTF-8 data but isn't configured to interpret it correctly. This is common in container environments where the default locale settings may be minimal or configured for ASCII.

This explains why you're seeing "â" characters - they're the first byte of a multi-byte UTF-8 character being displayed as if it were an ISO-8859-1 character.

Would you like me to provide more specific instructions for your particular setup? If so, could you share:
1. Which base container image you're using (Ubuntu, Alpine, etc.)
2. If you're using a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
3. How you're running Claude Code (direct command, script, etc.)
