# Core Pattern Guide

## Mathematical Foundations
- Golden ratio (1.618...) as primary proportioning system
- Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier mathematical structures
- Fibonacci sequences for recursive pattern sampling
- Wavelet transforms for multi-scale pattern analysis

## Token Optimization Patterns
- Hybrid execution with Claude 3.7's extended thinking mode
- Controlled verbosity with progressive disclosure
- Bach-inspired segmentation for task decomposition
- Pre-extraction of critical patterns before full context loading

## Multi-Sensory Integration
- Audio-visual-text pattern translation
- Mathematical wave representation across modalities
- User intent mapped to pattern categories
- Emotional state tracking via pattern relationships

## Implementation Architecture
- Edge-first processing (local before remote)
- Tiered memory system (ephemeral → working → reference → archival)
- Modular components following golden ratio proportions
- Bach-inspired counterpoint for AI model interaction
