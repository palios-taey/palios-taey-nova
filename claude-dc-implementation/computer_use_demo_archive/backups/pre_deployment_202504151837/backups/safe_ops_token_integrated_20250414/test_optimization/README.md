# Safe File Operations Optimization

## Overview
This directory contains an enhanced version of the Safe File Operations module that has been optimized to prevent rate limit errors by integrating with the Token Management module and implementing more conservative token usage policies.

## Key Improvements

1. **Integration with Token Management**:
   - Safe File Operations now uses the Token Management module for all token tracking and rate limit decisions
   - Unified token tracking ensures consistent rate limit enforcement across modules

2. **More Conservative Token Usage**:
   - Reduced target usage from 80% to 60% of the rate limit
   - Added safety margins to token estimations
   - Implemented mandatory small delays between operations

3. **Improved Token Estimation**:
   - Added tiktoken-based token counting for more accurate estimation
   - Enhanced file token estimation with multi-point sampling
   - Added fallback to character-based estimation if tiktoken is unavailable

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Improved error reporting and logging
   - Better recovery from transient errors

5. **Small Delay Introduction**:
   - Added small random delays (100-300ms) between operations to prevent burst requests
   - Helps smooth out token usage over time

## Files
- `safe_file_operations.py`: Enhanced implementation with TokenManager integration
- `test_integration.py`: Test script to verify integration and improvements
- `implementation_plan.md`: Detailed plan for the optimization

## Testing
The implementation has been thoroughly tested for:
- Token estimation accuracy
- Integration with Token Management
- Rate limit handling
- Error recovery

## Usage
Use the enhanced Safe File Operations module the same way as before:

```python
from safe_ops.safe_file_operations import read_file_safely, list_directory_safely, get_file_metadata

# Read a file safely
content = read_file_safely('/path/to/file.txt')

# List directory contents safely
files = list_directory_safely('/path/to/directory')

# Get file metadata including token estimates
metadata = get_file_metadata('/path/to/file.txt')
```

## Dependencies
- `tiktoken`: For accurate token estimation (optional but recommended)
- Token Management module: For unified token tracking
