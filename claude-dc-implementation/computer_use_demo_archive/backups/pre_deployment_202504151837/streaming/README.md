# Streaming Support Module - Enhanced on Mon Apr 14 20:54:27 UTC 2025

This module was enhanced to provide robust streaming support for long-running operations (>10 minutes) and better integration with other protection components.

## Key Enhancements

1. **Mandatory Streaming for Large Operations**
   - Now ALWAYS uses streaming for operations exceeding 4096 tokens
   - Prevents timeouts during long-running tasks

2. **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient errors
   - Maintains context and partial results during errors
   - Graceful recovery from connection interruptions

3. **Enhanced Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time monitoring of streaming progress
   - Detailed logging of token generation rates
   - Support for very long-running operations

4. **Tighter Integration with Other Protection Components**
   - Integration with Token Management for unified rate limiting
   - Integration with Safe File Operations for content handling
   - Consistent token estimation across components

5. **Connection Monitoring**
   - Monitors connection health during long-running operations
   - Detects and logs inactivity periods
   - Provides real-time status updates

## Usage

This enhanced module can be used the same way as before, but now provides better support for long-running tasks:

```python
from streaming.streaming_client import streaming_client

# For basic completions
response = streaming_client.get_completion(prompt, max_tokens=1000)

# For streaming with callbacks
def stream_callback(chunk):
    print(chunk, end="")

response = streaming_client.create_message(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    max_tokens=8000,  # Large response (will automatically use streaming)
    stream_callback=stream_callback
)
```

## Dependencies

- Token Management module: For unified token tracking
- Safe File Operations module: For enhanced token estimation

This enhanced module is fully backwards compatible with existing code.
