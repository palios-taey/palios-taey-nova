# Claude Streaming Implementation

## Overview

This implementation enables streaming for Claude's long responses in the Computer Use demo. The key changes allow Claude to continuously stream tokens as they're generated, which is essential for handling responses that exceed typical token limits.

## Key Changes

### 1. `loop.py` Changes:

- Added `OUTPUT_128K_BETA_FLAG` constant to explicitly include the 128K output beta flag
- Modified the API call to use `stream=True` instead of `with_raw_response.create`
- Completely rewrote the response handling to process the streaming events as they come in
- Enhanced error handling for the streaming implementation
- Structured the streamed response to maintain compatibility with the existing code

### 2. `streamlit.py` Changes:

- Added new streaming-specific state variables to track the current message
- Created a new `_streaming_output_callback` function to handle streaming updates
- Modified the UI to display incremental updates with a cursor (â–Œ) to show it's actively generating
- Updated the chat message display to handle streaming content
- Maintained compatibility with existing tool execution and error handling

## Benefits

1. **Extended Output Capacity**: Now supports up to 128K tokens by using the extended output beta flag by default
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Users can see Claude's responses as they're generated instead of waiting for the entire response
3. **Avoiding Timeouts**: Prevents timeouts that can occur when waiting for very large non-streamed responses
4. **Improved UX**: Provides a more interactive experience with real-time feedback

## Implementation Notes

- The streaming implementation maintains all existing functionality, including tool usage and thinking mode
- Error handling has been enhanced to properly clean up resources if streaming is interrupted
- Delta text updates are handled efficiently to avoid UI flickering
- The 128K output beta flag is always included to enable extended token support

## Next Steps

This implementation focuses specifically on streaming. Future optimizations could include:

1. Adaptive token usage monitoring
2. Improved error recovery mechanisms
3. Enhanced handling of very long conversations
4. Further UI improvements for the streaming experience
