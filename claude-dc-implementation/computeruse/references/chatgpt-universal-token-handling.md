Thank you Claude and ChatGPT for sharing your current tool infrastructure. I've reviewed the tool and loop implementations and will now conduct deep research into universal interception, chunked file access, queuing, memory reset mechanisms, and non-invasive integration strategies to ensure no file operation can bypass token protections.

I'll return with a comprehensive design and implementation strategy to support continuous, rate-limit-respecting tool use in the Claude DC environment.

# Implementing Universal Token-Aware File Operation Handling in Claude DC

## 1. Universal Tool Interception

**Transparent Proxy Layer for Tools:** To ensure *all* tools respect token limits, introduce a proxy interception layer that sits between the tools and the file system. This layer will catch every file read/write attempt and enforce chunking and token budgeting rules. The idea is to **monkey-patch** core file I/O functions and tool invocations so that tools cannot bypass the protection:
- **Monkey-Patch Python File I/O:** Override low-level file access functions like `open()`, `Path.read_text()`, and file object methods (`read()`, `readlines()`, etc.). For example, replace `builtins.open` with a wrapper that returns a custom file object. This custom object intercepts read calls, calculates the would-be token count of data to be read, and only allows reading up to the allowed chunk size:
  ```python
  import builtins, io
  original_open = builtins.open
  class InterceptedFile(io.IOBase):
      def __init__(self, file_obj, path):
          self.file = file_obj
          self.path = path
      def read(self, size=-1):
          data = self.file.read(size)
          token_count = estimate_tokens(data)
          if token_count > TOKEN_LIMIT:
              # Only return a chunk that fits in the token limit
              allowed_chars = get_char_count_for_tokens(TOKEN_LIMIT)
              partial = data[:allowed_chars]
              enqueue_remainder(data[allowed_chars:])  # queue rest for later if needed
              data = partial
          return data
      # (Also override readlines, __iter__, etc., similarly)
  def intercepted_open(path, mode='r', *args, **kwargs):
      f = original_open(path, mode, *args, **kwargs)
      if 'r' in mode:
          return InterceptedFile(f, path)
      return f
  builtins.open = intercepted_open
  ``` 
  In this snippet, `estimate_tokens()` would convert text bytes to an approximate token count (using a tokenizer or a char-to-token heuristic). If a read operation would exceed the token budget, it returns only a portion and queues the remainder (via `enqueue_remainder`) for later processing. This way, even if a tool like `str_replace_editor` calls `Path(path).read_text()`, it will go through our intercepted `open` and be constrained.

- **Intercept Subprocess Outputs (e.g. Bash):** Tools that spawn subprocesses (like the `bash` tool) need special handling because they can produce large outputs outside of Python’s file I/O. We create a wrapper for `subprocess.Popen`/`subprocess.run` or patch the tool’s execution function to intercept the output stream. For instance, in the `BashTool` implementation, instead of reading the entire stdout buffer at once, read it incrementally and apply token checks:
  - Modify the async read loop to check buffer length on each iteration. If the output grows beyond a safe threshold, inject a truncation and stop reading further. For example:
    ```python
    # Pseudocode inside BashTool session read loop:
    output_chunks = []
    while True:
        chunk = await self._process.stdout.read(CHUNK_BYTES)
        if not chunk: break  # EOF
        output_chunks.append(chunk.decode())
        if estimate_tokens(''.join(output_chunks)) > TOKEN_LIMIT:
            # Stop reading further, insert truncation notice
            output_chunks[-1] = output_chunks[-1] + "\n<response clipped>"
            # Optionally, flush remaining process output to /dev/null to clear buffer
            break
        # Check for sentinel in output as usual...
    output = ''.join(output_chunks)
    ```
    This ensures that a command like `cat large_file` will yield only a token-bounded portion of the file. The intercept layer would append a clear marker like `<response clipped>` indicating the output was truncated, aligning with Anthropic’s style (e.g. marking that only part of the file is shown ([一层一层的拆解openmanus 从 run_flow出发一步一步理解 代码设计理念_openmanus 源码-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40941102/article/details/146426649#:~:text=,path)) ([一层一层的拆解openmanus 从 run_flow出发一步一步理解 代码设计理念_openmanus 源码-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40941102/article/details/146426649#:~:text=TRUNCATED_MESSAGE%3A%20str%20%3D%20%28%20,))). The remainder of the subprocess output can be discarded or cached for later retrieval if needed, but it will not be sent to Claude in one go.
  - Alternatively, *wrap the Bash tool call:* Monkey-patch the `BashTool.__call__` method itself to intercept the returned `output`. After the tool finishes, examine `result.output`: if it exceeds token limits, truncate it and mark it clipped. This is a catch-all if we cannot stream the subprocess. The interception layer thus applies both at read-time and just before returning a `ToolResult` to double-ensure compliance.

- **Proxying Tool Calls Globally:** Instead of editing each tool, we can dynamically wrap them. For example, when the tool set is initialized (likely in a `tool_collection` or similar), replace each tool with a proxy object that intercepts calls:
  ```python
  class ToolProxy:
      def __init__(self, real_tool):
          self._tool = real_tool
          self.name = real_tool.name
          self.description = getattr(real_tool, "description", "")
      async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
          # Intercept call start (could enforce pre-checks here)
          result = await self._tool(*args, **kwargs)
          # Intercept call result
          if isinstance(result, ToolResult):
              # If output too large, truncate or queue
              tokens = estimate_tokens(result.output)
              if tokens > TOKEN_LIMIT:
                  result.output = result.output[:safe_cutoff(tokens)] + " <response clipped>"
          return result
      def __getattr__(self, attr):
          return getattr(self._tool, attr)
  # Wrap all tools in collection
  tools = [ToolProxy(t) for t in tools]
  tool_map = {t.name: t for t in tools}
  ``` 
  This uses composition to avoid modifying the Anthropic tool classes. The proxy’s `__call__` can enforce token limits both *before* execution (if inputs involve reading files) and *after*, on the resulting output. It delegates attribute access to maintain transparency. By inserting this proxy layer at startup, **every** tool invocation – whether it’s viewing a file, replacing text, or running a shell command – goes through our token-aware checks.

**Key Techniques:** Monkey-patching via Python’s dynamic nature allows us to intercept function calls without altering the underlying SDK:
- Use decorators or wrapper functions to override methods like `BaseAnthropicTool.__call__` or specific file-handling functions.
- Leverage Python’s import system: for example, import the `pathlib.Path` class and replace `Path.read_text` with a monitored version. Similarly, intercept any utility functions that the tools use for file ops (the quickstart uses a `run()` helper to execute shell commands – that can be wrapped to include token-check logic for its output).
- Ensure the intercept layer is loaded **early** (e.g., in `loop.py` before the agent starts or right after tools are instantiated) so that all subsequent tool operations are automatically routed through it.

## 2. Operation Queuing System

**Pre-Execution Token Budgeting:** Introduce a lightweight queuing system that evaluates the "token cost" of file operations **before** they execute. Each file read/write request from a tool will go through the queue:
- When a tool attempts a file operation (caught by our interceptors from section 1), create a queue entry describing the action (e.g. “read file X of size Y bytes”). Before actually performing the read, the interceptor checks the estimated token count of the content. This estimation can be done by file size or reading a small sample:
  - Use file size as a quick heuristic (e.g., 1 token ≈4 characters, or use Claude’s known tokenization if available) to predict if reading the entire file would overflow the allowed token budget.
  - If the estimate is below the threshold, allow immediate execution (pass through to actual file read).
  - If it exceeds the budget, enqueue the operation for chunked processing.

**Queuing and Batching Logic:** The system maintains a FIFO queue of pending file reads/writes that are too large to execute outright:
- **Delayed Execution:** Instead of failing immediately when a file is huge, the request is placed in the queue. The queue processor can then handle it in manageable slices. This prevents the agent from freezing or crashing – the tool call can return a message like “Large content; reading in progress...” immediately, or simply wait a moment until a slice is ready.
- **Batching:** If multiple file operations are queued (e.g., the agent triggers several reads in succession), the system can batch small ones together or schedule them serially. For instance, if recent token usage is high, the queue might delay a new large read a bit to let the model consume previous outputs first (avoiding back-to-back large tool results).
- **Prioritization:** The queue can prioritize based on context and recent usage. For example:
  - Give priority to smaller quick-read operations or critical files so they return results to Claude faster, improving interactivity.
  - Defer very large reads if the assistant just consumed a lot of tokens from a prior tool call. This avoids hitting rate limits – effectively throttling tool outputs under heavy load.
  - If multiple large reads are pending, serve them one chunk at a time rather than one file fully then the next. This interleaving ensures no single cycle monopolizes the token budget.
- **Graceful Failure Options:** If an operation absolutely cannot be executed within the token budget (e.g., a file is too massive to even chunk feasibly), the system should fail gracefully. Instead of causing an API error, the tool can return a controlled error message (a `ToolResult` with an error field or a clipped output note) explaining that the content is too large. This informs Claude of the situation, allowing it to possibly ask the user for guidance or attempt a narrower request.

**Token Cost Evaluation:** It’s crucial to have a reliable token estimation:
- Integrate a tokenizer for Claude’s model (if available via SDK) to count how many tokens a string would be. If not available, use an approximation (for example, use GPT-2 tokenization as a proxy or simply divide character length by ~4). Always include a safety margin.
- Example: If context limit is 100k tokens, we might enforce a per-tool-call limit of say 10k tokens for any file content. Before reading a file, check if file size > (10k * 4) chars ~ 40k chars. If yes, plan to chunk.
- The queue can also keep track of cumulative tokens used in the current conversation or time window to respect rate limits (Anthropic may have per-minute token quotas). If the sum of tokens from recent tool results + the upcoming read exceeds a threshold, the system can delay the new operation until the token budget “refreshes” (e.g., after some time or after older context is dropped).

**Mechanism for Chunking in Queue:** For a large read:
1. **Split into Segments:** The interceptor does not read the whole file at once. Instead, it opens the file and reads, say, N lines or N KB at a time (whatever roughly yields the token chunk size). Each chunk is enqueued as a separate sub-operation.
2. **Process Chunks Sequentially:** The queue processor reads the first chunk, stores any remaining file pointer state, and outputs that chunk as the tool’s result (with a marker if more is coming). The tool result to Claude could include something like “…<continued>” to signal that this is part 1. The queue then waits for the model’s next action (which might be to call the tool again for more, or proceed differently) before delivering the next chunk.
3. **Agent Coordination:** Ideally, Claude should decide to request the next chunk (for example, the truncation message could prompt it: “Output clipped, please use `view_range` or ask for next part”). Since Claude’s text editor tool supports a `view_range` parameter, the truncated message (as in Anthropic’s design) can guide Claude to request the specific range next ([一层一层的拆解openmanus 从 run_flow出发一步一步理解 代码设计理念_openmanus 源码-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40941102/article/details/146426649#:~:text=TRUNCATED_MESSAGE%3A%20str%20%3D%20%28%20,)) ([一层一层的拆解openmanus 从 run_flow出发一步一步理解 代码设计理念_openmanus 源码-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40941102/article/details/146426649#:~:text=,path)). This aligns the queuing mechanism with the model’s expected usage pattern (Claude might follow the hint to use a narrower range or search within the file).
4. **Timeout/Failure:** If the model does not request the remaining chunks, the queue can eventually discard them to free memory (with a timeout). If it does, the queued chunks can be delivered in subsequent tool calls.

In summary, the queue acts as a gatekeeper: *no file operation directly hits the disk or returns data* without first checking token impact. It either executes immediately if safe, or schedules the work in parts. This staging area prevents sudden token spikes that violate rate limits and lets the system **throttle and sequence file reads** gracefully.

## 3. Memory Management Between Tool Calls

**Streamed Reading & Chunked Processing:** To avoid large files ballooning memory, adopt a streaming approach:
- **Lazy Reads:** Do not load entire files into memory. Use Python generators or iterative reads (e.g., reading line by line or in fixed-size blocks). For example, instead of `content = path.read_text()`, do:
  ```python
  def stream_file(path, chunk_size=8192):
      with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
          while True:
              chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
              if not chunk:
                  break
              yield chunk
  # Usage:
  content_stream = stream_file(large_path)
  for chunk in content_stream:
      process(chunk)  # each chunk is handled immediately then discarded
  ```
  This ensures at most `chunk_size` bytes are in memory at once (aside from minor overhead). Each chunk can be processed (token counted, possibly sent as part of tool result) and then freed before reading the next chunk.

- **Immediate Output Consumption:** When a tool produces a large output (say, a long string from `bash` or file content), avoid storing it in variables that persist across calls. For instance, as soon as a chunk of output is ready to send to Claude, send it (or queue it) and then clear it from memory. If using streaming, one could even send partial output to Claude in a streaming fashion (if the API supports incremental tool_result streaming) so that we never accumulate the full content in memory. In practice, since tool results are typically sent as one message, our interceptor will at least ensure that only a limited-size message is constructed.
- **Token-Based Chunk Sizing:** Determine chunk sizes based on token estimates. For example, if we aim to keep each chunk under 2000 tokens, and we estimate ~4 chars/token, we read ~8000 characters at a time. This way, even in worst case, each chunk stays well below memory and context limits. Different file types might need different handling (binary files might not be sent to the model at all, or could be base64 encoded in chunks, etc.), but text files are the main focus for token usage.

**Context and State Isolation:** We want to avoid leftover data from one tool call contaminating the next:
- **Clear Tool State:** After a tool finishes execution, explicitly clear or reset any large data structures it used. For example, if `str_replace_editor` stores the file content in an internal history (for undo), consider trimming that history for very large files (maybe store only a diff or a reference to an on-disk backup rather than the full text in memory). Similarly, after a `bash` command that output a huge string, ensure that string isn’t stored in a persistent property. The quickstart Bash tool already clears its internal buffer ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/tools/bash.py at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/tools/bash.py?ref=musings.yasyf.com#:~:text=,output%20can%20be%20read%20correctly)); we extend that principle by also dropping references to the output in our interceptor after sending it to the model.
- **Scoped Execution Context:** Each tool call can run in an isolated scope so that once it returns, any local variables (especially large strings) are eligible for garbage collection. Python’s async tools naturally allow this—when the `await tool()` call completes, the local `result` can be deleted or go out of scope. We can explicitly `del result` after sending it off to Claude to hint that memory can be freed.
- **Avoid Global Caching of Content:** If the system had any caching mechanism (e.g., remembering file contents for faster subsequent access), it should either store only small snippets or use weak references so that the cache doesn’t retain large content longer than needed. Instead of caching full file text in memory, consider caching on disk if absolutely required, or not caching at all (always read on demand, since our streaming makes that reasonably efficient).
- **Freeing Resources:** It may be advisable to force a garbage collection cycle after an extremely large operation to ensure memory is released back to the OS. For example:
  ```python
  import gc
  # after finishing a large file read operation
  del large_content
  gc.collect()
  ```
  This helps in long-running sessions to prevent memory buildup from fragments of large objects.

**Prevent Cross-Contamination:** “Cross-contamination” refers to data from one tool call inadvertently being reused in another call’s context:
- Each tool’s sensitive state (like the Bash session or editor history) should be used only by that tool. We ensure that the interception layer doesn’t, for instance, accidentally carry over a file’s content from a `view` command into some other unrelated tool’s operation.
- Use **temporary files or streams** if a tool needs to pass large data to another tool, rather than in-memory variables. For instance, if Claude were to use `bash` to process output from the editor tool, we’d prefer the editor tool to save the content to a temp file and have bash read that file, rather than storing a huge string and giving it to bash directly.
- If memory usage is still a concern, as an extreme measure we could spawn certain high-memory operations in a separate worker process. For example, a dedicated process could handle reading a very large file and streaming results back to the main process. This way, even if it crashes or runs out of memory, the main agent process remains unaffected. After completion, that process can terminate, freeing all memory it used.

By managing memory in these ways, we **minimize the footprint of large file operations**. After each chunk or operation, memory is released, preventing accumulation. This not only avoids out-of-memory issues but also keeps the Python process lean, which is important in a Docker environment with limited resources.

## 4. Non-Invasive Integration Strategy

We aim to implement the above without breaking or forked modifications of the core Claude DC SDK, by strategically inserting our logic at extension points:

- **Monkey-Patching at Load Time:** Immediately after the Anthropic tools are imported/constructed, apply our monkey patches. For example, in the main loop (`loop.py` or equivalent controller that runs the tool-using conversation), do something like:
  ```python
  import computer_use_demo.tools as tools
  from interceptor import patch_all_tools
  patch_all_tools(tools)  # this function applies the open/subprocess patches and wraps tools
  ```
  This approach leverages the dynamic nature of Python modules. We inject our wrappers once, and from that point on, every tool call or file open will go through our logic. We do not modify the actual files like `bash.py` or `edit.py`; instead, we override functions in memory. This makes it easy to toggle the interception on/off for testing by simply including or skipping the patch call.

- **Hook Points in Claude’s Architecture:** Identify central points in the tool invocation flow where we can attach:
  - *`BaseAnthropicTool` execution:* If the SDK’s `BaseAnthropicTool` (or a base `BaseTool`) defines a common method for executing tools or returning results, we can override it. For instance, if there’s a `BaseAnthropicTool.__call__` that all tools rely on (perhaps it wraps the result in a `ToolResult`), we can monkey-patch that to intercept outputs. Even if tools override `__call__`, our proxy layer (as described in Section 1) can be attached to each tool instance.
  - *Tool registration:* The tool collection (perhaps managed in a class or dictionary) can be wrapped. In `tool_collection.py` or wherever tools are stored, we intercept when the agent fetches a tool to execute it. For example:
    ```python
    original_get = ToolCollection.get_tool
    def get_tool_intercept(self, name):
        tool = original_get(self, name)
        # return a proxy or wrapped version of tool
        return ToolProxy(tool)
    ToolCollection.get_tool = get_tool_intercept
    ``` 
    This way, the agent always gets a wrapped tool with our protections.  
  - *Subprocess calls:* At an even lower level, monkey-patch `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` or `subprocess.Popen` if needed, to wrap the stdout/stderr pipes with our monitors. This is invasive at the stdlib level but ensures **even if new tools are added or someone uses subprocess directly**, our limits apply.
  - *File open and Path methods:* As described, patching `builtins.open` and `pathlib.Path.read_text` centrally covers most file reads. We can similarly patch `Path.write_text` to enforce any needed limits on writing (like preventing an extremely large write that could later be read, or just for completeness and logging).

- **Minimal Changes to SDK Code:** We prefer not to edit Anthropic’s code (to ease upgrades and avoid maintenance issues). Our strategy uses wrappers and proxies *around* it:
  - For the Bash tool, if possible, subclass it and override the method that reads output. For example, 
    ```python
    class SafeBashTool(BashTool20250124):
        async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            result = await super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            result = enforce_token_limit(result)  # truncate if needed
            return result
    ```
    Then use `SafeBashTool()` instead of the original when registering tools. This way we override behavior without modifying the library code. Similarly, we could subclass `EditTool20250124` to override `read_file` with a token-aware version.
  - If subclassing all tools is too cumbersome, the earlier proxy approach (wrapping instances) is equally effective and avoids having to know internals of each tool.
  - Insert our intercept logic in `loop.py` just after the model outputs a `tool_use` and before executing it. In a pseudo-code loop:
    ```python
    for message in conversation:
        if message.type == "tool_use":
            tool = tools[message.name]
            # Interception start
            intercepted_call = token_limiter(tool, message.input) 
            result = await intercepted_call()
            # Interception end
            send_tool_result_to_model(result)
    ```
    Here `token_limiter(tool, input)` would return a coroutine or function that wraps the actual call with all our checks (possibly using the queue system). This is an insertion point that touches the loop logic slightly but keeps core tool code intact.
  
- **Integration with Claude DC Philosophy:** Claude’s “trust and safety” and rate-limit philosophy encourages keeping outputs concise and within context. By implementing truncation with notices (e.g., adding `<response clipped>`), we adhere to that philosophy ([一层一层的拆解openmanus 从 run_flow出发一步一步理解 代码设计理念_openmanus 源码-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40941102/article/details/146426649#:~:text=,path)). Our solution is non-invasive in that it doesn’t alter how Claude uses tools; it simply ensures that any tool output or file read is pre-vetted for length. This aligns with the idea that the model should *never* see content beyond the allowed limit, preserving coherence and preventing the model from running over its context window.

- **Extensibility:** Because we inject at a high level (builtins and base classes), this system will automatically cover future tools or custom tools. For instance, if a new tool is added later that tries to read a file or execute a command, it will by default use `open` or `subprocess` and thus be intercepted. The design is modular: we can maintain a configuration of token limits and apply the same `patch_all_tools()` initialization in any Claude DC environment container.

In short, we carefully choose monkey-patch points that require adding only a few lines of initialization code, keeping the core SDK “untouched” while **guaranteeing every tool action funnels through our interceptor**.

## 5. Testing and Verification

To ensure the system works as intended, we’ll employ a multi-pronged testing strategy:

**Unit Tests for Interception:** Develop small test cases for the interceptor functions:
- Test the `intercepted_open` by reading a dummy file:
  - Create a file with known content (small and large variants). When reading through our patched `open`, verify that:
    - For a small file, the content is returned unchanged and no queue actions are triggered.
    - For a large file (exceeding the token limit), the returned content is truncated to the expected size and includes the truncation marker. Also verify that the remainder of the file content was queued or discarded as per design.
  - Check that multiple sequential reads don’t bleed into each other (each call starts fresh).
- Test the subprocess interception:
  - Simulate a `bash` command that produces a large output (for example, use `yes` or `head -c` to generate a big output in a controlled way). Verify that our patched Bash tool or subprocess wrapper stops reading at the limit and appends the `<response clipped>` notice. Ensure that the Bash process doesn’t remain stuck (it should either continue running but with its buffer cleared or be restarted gracefully in subsequent calls).
  - Test a normal bash output (e.g., `echo Hello`) to ensure it still returns correctly (no clipping of small outputs).

**Integration Tests in Claude DC Environment:** Run end-to-end scenarios in the Docker Claude DC setup:
- Configure a scenario where Claude is asked to open a very large file (one that would previously cause a rate limit or context overflow). Observe the behavior:
  - Claude should receive a truncated chunk of the file. We expect no API errors. The conversation log (or Claude’s next message) should show the `<response clipped>` notice in the tool result.
  - If Claude then asks for the rest of the content (or uses the suggested approach to narrow the view), ensure that works: our system should allow the next chunk to be read (if it was queued or by reading the file with a range).
- Test rapid consecutive file accesses:
  - For example, have Claude read multiple files in one session (one after the other). Our logging should show that after each file read, the token usage was calculated and the queue potentially delayed the next read if needed. Verify that no combined overload occurs (the second file should be allowed or deferred based on the first’s size).
  - If possible, simulate parallel tool usage (if Claude 3.7’s token-efficient mode calls tools in parallel threads). Ensure that our global lock/queue serializes these so they don’t execute truly concurrently. This can be tested by instrumenting the code with logs when a read starts and ends and confirming they don’t overlap for large operations.

**Logging and Tracing:** We will build a logging facility into the interceptor:
- Every time a file operation is intercepted, log an entry with details: tool name, file path, size (bytes), estimated tokens, action taken (allowed, truncated, queued).
- Every time a chunk is sent or a truncation happens, log how many tokens were sent and how many were left unread.
- Use Python’s `logging` module with a dedicated logger (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger("token_interceptor")`). This allows easy enabling or silencing of debug info. In a production setting, one might keep it at INFO level to log only significant events (like a truncation occurring, or when a queue delays an operation).
- Example log output for a large read might be:
  ```
  [INFO] Intercepted read of file '/data/big.txt' (size=5MB, ~125k tokens). Exceeds 10k token limit; splitting into chunks.
  [INFO]   -> Returning chunk 1/5 (2000 tokens) to model, marked as clipped.
  [DEBUG]  -> Queued remaining 4 chunks for on-demand retrieval.
  ```
  This kind of trace allows us to verify at runtime that the logic is doing what we expect, and it’s invaluable for debugging if Claude’s behavior is not as expected (e.g., if it doesn’t ask for remaining chunks, we can see that in logs).
- We will also track token usage over time. For example, maintain a counter of how many tokens have been sent via tools in the last N minutes and log a warning if approaching the rate limit. This helps verify that our throttling mechanism works. If we deliberately push the system (read many files in a row), the logs should show the queue kicking in: “Too many tokens used in last 60s, delaying next file operation.”

**Graceful Degradation Testing:** Intentionally test edge cases:
- Files that are just at the boundary of allowed size (off-by-one scenarios) to ensure we don’t offload an extra chunk by mistake.
- Non-text files: verify that binary data doesn’t break the token estimator (we might decide to not allow binary reads to Claude at all, but if we do, ensure we perhaps convert to hex or warn rather than trying to dump raw binary).
- Ensure that tools like `undo_edit` (which might internally rely on `_file_history`) still function – our interception shouldn’t interfere with storing history, except we might log it. We test editing a large file and undoing to see that memory doesn’t blow up (perhaps limit the history length for huge content).

After running these tests, we will have confidence in the system. We should observe that:
- **No more rate-limit errors or context overflow**: The prompt token count should stay within limits because our interceptor clipped content as needed.
- **Acceptable performance**: The overhead of our layer (monkey patches and token calculations) should not slow down small operations noticeably. We can measure that reading small files is still fast. Large reads will of course be slower (due to chunking), but that’s expected and is the trade-off for safety.
- **Claude’s coherence**: Claude should handle the clipped outputs gracefully (especially since we format the notice similarly to Anthropic’s style, Claude is likely trained to recognize `<response clipped>` and respond by adjusting its strategy). We can verify that Claude doesn’t get confused or hallucinate missing content; ideally it will follow the suggestion to refine the query or read further.

Finally, maintain a feedback loop: enable detailed logging in staging and monitor real usage in the Claude DC environment. If any tool somehow evades the interception (which shouldn’t happen if we covered open, subprocess, etc.), the logs or errors will reveal it, and we can quickly patch that gap. By thoroughly testing and monitoring, we ensure the **universal token-aware handling** is robust and future-proof, allowing Claude to use tools freely without ever overstepping token bounds.

Great. I’ll review Claude’s `tool_intercept.py` implementation in full detail, evaluate its coverage, edge safety, and integration behavior, and then recommend enhancements across three dimensions:

1. **Edge-Case Coverage & Compatibility** – Verifying it protects against all current Claude DC tool behaviors including `bash`, `Path`, and subprocess flows.
2. **Deep Introspection Extensions** – Exploring enhancements such as subprocess I/O interception, file descriptor mirroring, or in-memory usage caps.
3. **Performance Monitoring Hooks** – Proposing lightweight profiling and debugging hooks that visualize queue health, tool delays, and token-safe chunking in action.

I’ll also answer whether the current implementation is solid enough to ship now with enhancement layering later, or if a few of the enhancements should be incorporated in the first version for safety or visibility.

I’ll return with a prioritized rollout recommendation, implementation sketches, and detailed validation notes.

# Tool Interceptor Implementation Review for Claude DC

## 1. Coverage & Safety Assessment

- **File Operation Monkey-Patching:** The interceptor **monkey-patches all key file read operations**. It replaces Python’s built-in `open` (for text read mode) and `pathlib.Path.read_text` with safe versions ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=%23%20Patch%20built,Patched%20builtins.open)), and similarly wraps `Path.read_bytes` ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,Patched%20Path.read_bytes)). This ensures that any file content read through standard means is intercepted. All text reads go through `ToolInterceptor.intercept_open` or `intercept_path_read_text`, which queue and chunk the content as needed. Notably, the patch targets text modes – binary reads (`'rb'`) are passed through unaltered ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,mode)). This means normal text file reads are controlled, but reading a file in binary mode (and then decoding it) could bypass the interceptor’s logic. For example, the screenshot tool uses `Path.read_bytes()` to get image data ([computer.py](file://file-MnAhPA85LD47fgG64ieK2Y#:~:text=base64_image%3Dbase64.b64encode%28path.read_bytes%28%29%29.decode%28%29%20%29%20raise%20ToolError%28f,result.error)), which the interceptor currently lets through without chunking ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=def%20intercept_path_read_bytes%28self%2C%20path_obj%29%3A%20,read_bytes%20calls)). In general, **all expected file-reading entry points** (open, read_text) are patched, but binary data reads are not chunked (assuming they “don’t affect tokens” – an assumption that can be problematic if binary data gets converted to text, as with base64 images).

- **Queueing & Token Limit Enforcement:** All intercepted file reads are funneled into an `OperationQueue` that enforces rate limits and chunk sizes. Each file read operation is enqueued with an **estimated token count**, and the queue’s worker only executes it if the current token usage is under a safe threshold ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,pop%280)). This design prevents a large file from being read in one go during high usage. When executed, the read is performed and the token usage is recorded via the token manager ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,0)). If a file is huge, the interceptor will **split it into chunks** not exceeding ~10k tokens each by reading line by line until the chunk threshold is reached ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,estimated_tokens%7D%20tokens%29%2C%20chunking)). The first chunk is returned with a note and subsequent chunks are stored for on-demand retrieval. This ensures that **tool outputs from file reads are clipped and provided in manageable pieces**, never flooding Claude’s context in one response. The logic covers direct file content (text) reads thoroughly. For instance, the Edit tool’s `view` command uses `path.read_text()`, which now goes through this interceptor and will yield only the first chunk plus a “[Use safe_cat for next chunk]” note if the file is large ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,0%5D%20self.current_chunk_index%20%3D%201)) ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=if%20len%28chunks%29%20,return%20first_chunk%20else%3A%20return)).

- **Tool Integration (Edit, etc.):** The patch explicitly hooks into known tool classes to make sure they use the safe file operations. For example, the **StrReplace Editor tool** (`EditTool20250124`) had a `read_file` method that directly called `Path.read_text`; the interceptor replaces this with a safe version that delegates to `intercept_path_read_text` ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,read_file)). This ensures the Edit tool cannot bypass the queue by calling `Path.read_text` internally – it’s now using the same controlled path (the code even attaches the interceptor instance to the tool class for use in that method). The comment `# Patch other tools as needed` ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,)) indicates that similar treatment can be extended to other tools. **However, not all tools are patched yet** – currently the code only shows an explicit patch for the edit tool. The design is ready to patch additional tools (e.g. a `BashTool` or others) but those hooks appear incomplete in this version.

- **Bash & Subprocess Outputs:** Integration with the Bash tool (and any subprocess-based tool) is **not fully implemented in this interceptor version**. The Bash tool executes shell commands and captures their output from an async process, building a full string of stdout output until a sentinel is seen ([bash.py](file://file-QioKB16nb5bHNxXHkoRRRU#:~:text=await%20asyncio.sleep%28self._output_delay%29%20,output.index%28self._sentinel)). This content retrieval is not using `open` or `Path.read_text`, so it **bypasses the current monkey-patches**. As a result, a command that produces a very large output (for example, `cat` on a huge file or a long directory listing) would accumulate a giant string in `_BashSession.run` and return it entirely in a `ToolResult` without chunking. There is no chunking or token-aware clipping in the Bash tool’s `_buffer.decode()` logic – it simply breaks when it sees the sentinel, not when output is too long ([bash.py](file://file-QioKB16nb5bHNxXHkoRRRU#:~:text=forever%20for%20,output.index%28self._sentinel%29%5D%20break%20except%20asyncio.TimeoutError)). The only safeguard is a static truncation in the generic `run()` utility (used by some tools like find/grep) which trims output at 16,000 characters ([run.py](file://file-RpDcQbjgFUvrEVJAy78hQn#:~:text=def%20maybe_truncate,truncate_after%5D%20%2B%20TRUNCATED_MESSAGE)), but **the Bash tool does not use this**. Therefore, **output overflow via Bash is a potential bypass** of the interceptor. The current system partly mitigates this by instructing the AI (in the system prompt) to avoid massive direct outputs (e.g. suggesting use of `grep` or redirect to file for large outputs ([loop.py](file://file-BFeayHqmqQKVvUdC55qEHk#:~:text=with%20bash%20tool%20will%20appear,before%20deciding%20something%20isn%27t%20available))), but technically nothing in code stops a huge Bash output from flooding the context. Similarly, other tools like the **screenshot capture** in `computer.py` read a file’s bytes and base64-encode them ([computer.py](file://file-MnAhPA85LD47fgG64ieK2Y#:~:text=base64_image%3Dbase64.b64encode%28path.read_bytes%28%29%29.decode%28%29%20%29%20raise%20ToolError%28f,result.error)); since `read_bytes` isn’t chunked, a large image could inject a very long base64 string into the context. These are **bypass vectors** where the interceptor’s coverage is incomplete.

- **Completeness of Monkey-Patching:** Aside from the Bash and binary-read cases, the monkey-patching covers most file access paths. The interceptor is initialized at import time and `monkey_patch_all()` is called to apply patches globally ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=Apply%20all%20monkey%20patches%20to,monkey_patch_all)), so as long as this module is imported early (before tools are used), it will catch file operations in time. One should double-check that `tool_intercept.py` is imported **very early in the app startup** (the plan suggests modifying `loop.py` to import it first ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=5.%20,successful%20testing%2C%20move%20to%20production))). If any tool or code opens a file before the interceptor is applied, that could slip past – but with the planned integration, that risk is low. In summary, the interceptor effectively guards **direct file reads** and those tool methods patched to use it. The major safety gaps are **unpatched tool methods** that don’t use the standard open/read_text (notably Bash output and any similar subprocess outputs, plus any future file read method not monkey-patched). Addressing those will be important to achieve truly universal interception.

## 2. Optional Enhancement Proposals

- **Deeper Subprocess Output Interception:** To handle tools like **Bash** (or any subprocess outputs) more robustly, consider intercepting at a lower level. One approach is to modify the Bash tool itself to stream its output in chunks rather than collecting the entire output string. For example, `_BashSession.run` could be refactored to read from `stdout` incrementally and send partial results through the same `OperationQueue`. This would involve awaiting small reads on the stdout pipe and enqueueing those chunks to the interceptor (or manually truncating when a threshold is reached). Another approach is to have the Bash tool **redirect large command outputs to a temporary file**, and then use `safe_cat` (the interceptor’s safe reader) to deliver it chunkwise. This way, even if the agent forgets to manually do so, the tool itself ensures large content goes through the file-chunking pipeline. Intercepting `asyncio.subprocess` at a system level is tricky, but wrapping the reading logic in the Bash tool (or monkey-patching the Bash tool’s `run` method similarly to how the edit tool was patched) is feasible. This enhancement would prevent any subprocess from **dumping an unbounded stream** into Claude’s context by ensuring the output is token-limited just like file reads.

- **Memory Pooling & Output Window Management:** As the system uses multiple tools over time, their outputs accumulate in the conversation. It would be wise to manage the context memory each tool’s output occupies. One idea is to implement a **sliding window or pool** for tool outputs: for instance, limit each tool invocation to contribute at most N tokens to the conversation, or automatically discard/truncate older tool outputs if the conversation length grows too large. In fact, the code already includes logic to drop older images beyond a certain count ([loop.py](file://file-BFeayHqmqQKVvUdC55qEHk#:~:text=total_images%20%3D%20sum,)) (to save context space for screenshots). A similar strategy could be applied to text: for example, if a tool returns a very large text (even chunked, it might span multiple chunks), the system could keep only the most recent chunk(s) visible and stash or summarize older chunks. Per-instance output windows could ensure that one runaway tool call doesn’t crowd out the context. Additionally, a **memory pool** for tool outputs could enable reusing buffers for large data to avoid memory bloat (for instance, recycling the chunk buffer list after the file is fully read and not needed again). While the current design splits and delivers chunks, it stores all chunks of a large file in memory (`interceptor.file_chunks`). An enhancement could be to limit how many chunks are kept (maybe evicting or compressing them once delivered or if not accessed after some time) to conserve memory. These changes would improve the **memory safety and efficiency** of the tool outputs without affecting the core functionality.

- **Trust Tokens & Usage Metadata:** It may be beneficial to annotate each tool result with metadata about its generation – for instance, how many tokens were consumed or whether it was delivered in chunks. This could tie into a **“trust token” system**, where each tool invocation carries a sort of credibility or usage cost marker. Concretely, the interceptor could append a hidden field in the `ToolResult` or a log entry indicating the token count of the output or chunk number. This metadata could be used for monitoring or for adaptive behaviors (e.g., if a tool is consuming an unusually large number of tokens, the system could decide to warn or throttle further tool use). In Claude DC’s context, a “trust token” might refer to a system of tracking allowed usage or confidence in the output. We could integrate with that by, say, having the interceptor flag when an output was truncated or chunked (so the agent knows it didn’t see the whole content) or assign a trust level if an output is partial. At minimum, including the **token usage stats per tool call** (perhaps via the `token_manager` or in the logs) would help developers and the system audit how tools are being used. For example, the interceptor already knows the estimated token cost for each file operation it queues ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=,read_text_func%2C%20estimated_tokens%3Destimated_tokens%2C%20callback%3Dcallback)); this data could be attached to the `ToolResult` or printed in a `<system>` note (though that might be visible to the model, which may or may not be desired). Alternatively, a separate logging of “Tool X output used Y tokens (Z% of limit)” can build a trail of trust/usage over time. These enhancements would not change functionality but would improve transparency and control, especially in a multi-tool environment where certain outputs might be restricted based on usage quotas or trust levels.

## 3. Profiling & Debugging Hooks

- **Operational Logging & Visualization:** The interceptor module already sets up a basic logging system ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=Configure%20logging%20logging.basicConfig%28%20level%3Dlogging.INFO%2C%20format%3D%27,logging.FileHandler%28%27%2Ftmp%2Ftool_intercept.log%27%29%2C%20logging.StreamHandler%28%29)), logging events like queuing and chunking. To further aid profiling, we can add **lightweight logging hooks** that periodically report the internal state of the operation queue and token usage. For example, the `OperationQueue.get_stats()` method provides counts of queued and completed operations and chunks created ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=def%20get_stats%28%29%3A%20,about%20the%20interceptor)). By logging these stats at regular intervals (or at the end of each operation execution), one could graph the throughput of file operations and see how often chunking occurs. Visualization hooks could be as simple as printing a summary after each tool use, or as advanced as a small web dashboard or console table that updates live. This would let developers monitor if the queue is backing up or if the token usage is nearing limits frequently. Also, tracking the **delay and wait times** in the queue (perhaps logging when an operation had to wait due to rate limit – the code logs when it’s waiting for token budget ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=else%3A%20,of%20limit%29%22%29%20time.sleep%281))) can help tune the `percent_used` threshold or chunk sizes.

- **Detailed Debug Mode:** Implementing a debug mode (perhaps triggered by an environment variable or a config flag) would allow developers to **trace file chunking and tool outputs step by step** without flooding the normal logs. In debug mode, the interceptor could log each chunk’s details – e.g., “Chunk 1 for file X: 9,500 tokens” or even output a snippet of the chunk content for verification. It could also trace the chunk retrieval via `safe_cat` (noting when a user or agent requests the next chunk with `get_next_chunk`). Similarly, for queued operations, debug logs could announce “Executing op_id, token_estimate=..., waited N seconds in queue.” These messages would make it much easier to verify that the system is splitting and gating content as expected. Another useful debugging hook is to instrument the tool outputs in testing: for instance, when a `ToolResult` is formed, print the length of the output and whether it was truncated or chunked. This could catch any cases where a tool’s result slipped past the interceptor. Because the interceptor is heavily asynchronous (thread-based queue plus possibly asyncio tools), having a **visual timeline or sequence log** of events (queuing -> executing -> callback) would help in debugging race conditions or performance bottlenecks. All these debugging features should be kept optional or lightweight (to avoid performance impact in production). Enabling a debug mode could be as easy as switching the logger to DEBUG level and adding more `logger.debug()` calls at key points (since currently most logs are at INFO level). The goal is to provide developers clear insight into **how data flows through the interceptor**, how chunks are formed, and how the rate limiting behaves in real time, which is invaluable for both testing and future tuning.

## 4. Deployment Recommendations

Given the analysis, the interceptor as written significantly improves safety for file operations but leaves a couple of known gaps. **Whether to deploy immediately or wait for enhancements depends on the urgency and risk tolerance:**

- **Deploy Now, Iterate Soon:** If the rate-limit issue is causing severe problems in the current system, deploying this interceptor now will *immediately plug the biggest hole*, which was unbounded file reads. The edit and file-view tools will no longer overrun the context, and the token budget enforcement via the queue should prevent sudden spikes in usage. This could be a huge improvement in Claude DC’s stability. The risks of deploying now are the unaddressed cases – e.g., if the AI issues a large `bash` command output or takes a big screenshot, it could still hit the limit. However, these scenarios might be less common or can be managed temporarily through prompt instructions (as already done in the system prompt). In a controlled rollout, you could deploy the current fix and monitor usage: if you observe that users or the AI seldom trigger the problematic cases, you gain the benefit of the fix without waiting. Meanwhile, the development team can work on the Bash output interception and other enhancements in parallel. This approach gets protection in place for the most frequent failure mode (file reads) and buys time to implement the rest.

- **Incorporate Key Enhancements First:** If time allows, it would be safer to address the **critical gaps before the first deployment** of this interceptor. In particular, adding protection for subprocess outputs (the Bash tool) is highly recommended before deployment, because it is a known vector that could reintroduce the same issue from a different angle. Since we’ve identified a clear solution (e.g., chunking or truncating Bash outputs), implementing that upfront would ensure the “universal” interceptor truly covers all channels of data going into Claude’s context. Similarly, handling the screenshot tool’s base64 output (perhaps by chunking it or limiting resolution) before deployment would close that loophole. These key fixes would ensure that *all* obvious large-output cases are handled, making the system robust from day one. The optional features like detailed logging, trust metadata, or refined memory management can reasonably be added iteratively after deployment, as they are quality improvements rather than emergency fixes. By incorporating the most important enhancement (Bash output interception) now, you reduce the chance of any remaining rate-limit spikes, which in turn means a smoother deployment with less risk of having to rollback or issue hotfixes.

**Recommendation:** Deploying the interceptor **should not be much delayed**, as it already solves a majority of the issue, but I strongly recommend **closing the known high-risk gap (Bash tool output)** before deploying to production. In practice, this means a short additional development cycle to patch the Bash tool (or wrap it with the interceptor logic) now, and then moving the combined fix to production. Once that’s live, monitor the system and progressively implement the other enhancements (improved logging, memory pooling, etc.) in subsequent updates. This hybrid approach balances expedience with caution – you deliver a big improvement quickly, but also ensure that the most obvious hole isn’t left open. In contrast, deploying immediately *without* addressing Bash output means you must rely on prompt-based mitigation and hope the AI doesn’t trigger a large output; given that we already have a solution approach, it’s worth implementing it now rather than gambling on good behavior. Therefore, the best course is: **address the critical missing patches upfront, deploy the interceptor, and then iterate on the nice-to-have enhancements.**

### Prioritized Action Items

1. **Patch Subprocess Outputs (High Priority):** Update the Bash tool (`BashTool20250124`) to prevent unrestricted output. For example, implement output chunking or file redirection for large results, or monkey-patch the Bash tool’s `_session.run` to integrate with the interceptor. This closes the main bypass path immediately.  
2. **Handle Large Binary Reads (High Priority):** Ensure non-text data that converts to text (like screenshots) won’t overflow context. This could mean chunking `Path.read_bytes` when the resulting data is huge (e.g., split base64 image strings), or limiting image resolution/file size before encoding. This is the second major safety gap to fix early.  
3. **Early Integration in Startup (High Priority):** Verify that `tool_intercept.py` is imported and initialized at the very start of Claude DC’s runtime (e.g., in `loop.py` before any tool use) ([tool_intercept.py](file://file-YFJvNYQFTcqqVCBkoewhbN#:~:text=5.%20,successful%20testing%2C%20move%20to%20production)). This isn’t a code change to the interceptor itself but an essential deployment step to ensure full coverage.  
4. **Test & Tune in Staging (High Priority):** Before broad release, run a suite of tool use cases in a test environment. Include cases like viewing a large file, using the editor, running a command with huge output, taking a large screenshot, etc. Verify the output is correctly chunked or truncated and no rate limits are hit. This will confirm the above patches work as intended.  
5. **Logging and Monitoring Hooks (Medium Priority):** Enhance the interceptor with additional logging or an accessible `get_stats` interface. For instance, log queue length and token usage periodically, and record whenever chunking occurs (perhaps log “File X split into N chunks of ~M tokens”). This will help in monitoring the system health in production and can be done alongside or shortly after deployment.  
6. **Debug/Dev Mode (Medium Priority):** Implement a debug mode toggle for developers. When enabled, have the interceptor output detailed traces of its operations (without exposing to end-users). This will aid future debugging and can be added in an iterative update.  
7. **Memory Management Improvements (Lower Priority):** Observe how the system performs with the new interceptor. If memory usage of stored chunks becomes an issue or conversation length grows, implement the suggested memory pooling or output window limitations. This might involve auto-discarding old chunks or summarizing long outputs after the fact. It’s an important improvement but can be scheduled after the critical fixes are stable.  
8. **Trust & Metadata Integration (Lower Priority):** As a longer-term enhancement, integrate token usage metadata or a trust token mechanism for tool outputs. This could be done in conjunction with analytics – for now, it’s enough to log the usage info. Later, you might use it to influence the agent’s behavior or for admin oversight.  

By following this prioritized list, Claude DC will gain a robust universal tool interceptor in a timely manner, addressing the most dangerous issues first and steadily improving safety and transparency over subsequent iterations.
