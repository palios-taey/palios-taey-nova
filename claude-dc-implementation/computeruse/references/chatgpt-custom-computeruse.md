Thank you for the detailed clarification. I completely understand how important this is.

I'll now conduct deep research to find proven, working implementations for Claude Computer Use (Claude DC) that:
- Enable streaming properly for large prompt and output (supporting 128K output beta)
- Fully support tool usage during streaming
- Correctly handle thinking notes
- Provide a stable, scalable foundation for further custom enhancements
- Are compatible with Claude 3.7 Sonnet and the latest Anthropic APIs.

I'll come back to you with a comprehensive technical blueprint, including exact file structures, examples, and steps to implement it cleanly as a custom AI-FIRST solution.

# Continuous Streaming with Tools in Claude 3.7 (Computer Use) ‚Äì Implementation Guide

## Overview and Goals  
Claude 3.7 Sonnet‚Äôs **Computer Use** mode enables an AI agent to control a computer via tools, but unlocking its full potential requires a robust streaming implementation. The goal is to support **continuous streaming responses** ‚Äì even for extremely large outputs (20K+ tokens, up to the 128K-token beta limit) ‚Äì while fully enabling **tool use** and **‚Äúthinking‚Äù notes** (the model‚Äôs chain-of-thought) in real time. We outline a proven solution that goes beyond the default demo, providing a stable, scalable foundation for an AI-first system. 

**Key requirements:**
- **True streaming** for all interactions (no cutoff at 20K tokens), using the 128K output beta for Claude 3.7 Sonnet ([All models overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#:~:text=Include%20the%20beta%20header%20%60output,7%20Sonnet)).  
- **Integrated tool usage** during streaming (the AI can call functions without breaking the stream).  
- **Live ‚Äúthinking‚Äù notes** streamed to the UI, showing Claude‚Äôs reasoning steps.  
- A **modular architecture** (separate agent loop, tools, UI) that is stable and extensible for future enhancements.  
- **Performance optimizations** (prompt caching, parallelization where possible) and robust error handling for reliability.

## Enabling Streaming and 128K-Token Outputs  
Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports very large outputs ‚Äì by default up to 64K tokens, and **128K tokens in beta mode** ([All models overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#:~:text=Comparative%20latency%20Fast%20Fast%20Fastest,2024%20Aug%202023%20Aug%202023)) ([All models overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#:~:text=Include%20the%20beta%20header%20%60output,7%20Sonnet)). To allow continuous streaming of such long answers: 

- **Use the streaming API:** Set `"stream": true` in the request. This instructs Claude to return an HTTP **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** stream that incrementally yields tokens instead of waiting for the full completion ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=We%20strongly%20recommend%20that%20use,to%20handle%20these%20events%20yourself)). Streaming is critical for large outputs; Anthropic *strongly suggests* using streaming or batch mode for big outputs ([All models overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#:~:text=Include%20the%20beta%20header%20%60output,7%20Sonnet)) to avoid timeouts and improve user experience.  
- **Include the 128K output beta header:** To unlock the 128K-token output capability, add the HTTP header `anthropic-beta: output-128k-2025-02-19` in requests ([All models overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#:~:text=Include%20the%20beta%20header%20%60output,7%20Sonnet)). This raises Claude 3.7‚Äôs max generation length from 64K to 128K tokens (sufficient for ~100K-word outputs). Ensure your API client or SDK supports adding this header.  
- **Large `max_tokens` setting:** In the request payload, set `max_tokens` to the upper bound of tokens you want Claude to generate (e.g. 100000 or 128000). This, combined with the beta header, allows extremely long answers. 
- **Stream parsing:** Expect the response as a sequence of SSE events (`message_start`, `content_block_delta`, etc.). Each `content_block_delta` carries a snippet of text (or other content) to append. Your client code should read these events in real time and update the UI as they arrive. For example, the events might look like:  
  ```json
  event: content_block_delta  
  data: {"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "This is the sta"}}  
  event: content_block_delta  
  data: {"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "rt of a long answer..."}}  
  ```  
  You will accumulate the `text_delta` pieces into the growing output. Once a `message_stop` event arrives, the assistant‚Äôs turn is complete.  

**Tip:** If using Anthropic‚Äôs Python/TypeScript SDK, leverage its streaming support (which yields content in a loop) ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=We%20strongly%20recommend%20that%20use,to%20handle%20these%20events%20yourself)). Otherwise, use an HTTP client (e.g. `httpx` or `requests` with SSE support) to handle the SSE events manually. In either case, the streaming design ensures the UI can render partial results continuously, even for extremely large answers.

## Tool Use in Streaming Mode (Interaction Loop Design)  
Enabling Claude‚Äôs tool use during streaming requires orchestrating a **multi-turn loop** between your application and the model. Claude‚Äôs API supports function calls (termed **‚Äútools‚Äù** in Anthropic‚Äôs interface) in a way that the model‚Äôs response is split into **content blocks** ‚Äì e.g. some reasoning text, then a tool call. The agent loop must handle these events dynamically without losing streaming continuity. The proven approach is: 

1. **Define available tools** in the API request. You provide a list of tool definitions (name, description, and JSON input schema) under the `"tools"` field when sending the user‚Äôs question ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=,)) ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=%5D%2C%20,true)). For the Claude **Computer Use** environment, tools might include actions like opening a browser, typing text, taking screenshots, etc. (Anthropic provides a preset toolset for ‚Äúcomputer_use‚Äù ‚Äì enabled via a beta flag like `anthropic-beta: computer-use-2025-01-24` ‚Äì but you can also define custom tools). Use `tool_choice: "auto"` (default) so Claude decides when/which tool to use ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=,are%20provided)). 

2. **Send the user‚Äôs message and stream the response.** For example, the initial payload might be:  
   ```json
   {
     "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
     "stream": true,
     "tools": [ { "name": "...", "description": "...", "input_schema": { ... } }, ... ],
     "tool_choice": {"type": "auto"},
     "messages": [ 
       {"role": "user", "content": "Find the latest Anthropic press release and open it."} 
     ]
   }
   ```  
   As Claude‚Äôs reply streams in, handle it incrementally. Claude will often first output a chain-of-thought text (if not suppressed) and then indicate a tool invocation. For example, the stream could yield: ‚Äú<thinking>Sure, I will search for ‚ÄòAnthropic press release‚Äô...</thinking>‚Äù followed by a tool call block.

3. **Detect the tool call in Claude‚Äôs reply.** Claude signals a function call via a content block of type `"tool_use"`. In the streaming events, you‚Äôll see a `content_block_start` with `"type": "tool_use"` and a series of `input_json_delta` events revealing the tool‚Äôs arguments as Claude ‚Äúwrites‚Äù them ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_start%20data%3A%20%7B)) ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_delta%20data%3A%20%7B,San)). Finally, a `content_block_stop` occurs with `stop_reason: "tool_use"` ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_stop%20data%3A%20%7B)). At this point, Claude has finished its turn *early*, specifically to let the tool execute. You should: 

   - **Extract the tool name and parameters** from the completed `"tool_use"` content block (e.g. tool name `"get_weather"` and input `{"location": "San Francisco, CA"}`) ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=%7D%2C%20%7B%20,%7D)) ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=When%20you%20receive%20a%20tool,use%20response%2C%20you%20should)). 
   - **Run the actual tool function** in your environment. This might involve executing an API call, running a system command, etc., depending on the tool. Capture the result and/or any error.  
   - **Stream partial output to the user:** *Don‚Äôt pause the UI.* While the tool runs, you can optionally show a placeholder like ‚Äúüîç Searching...‚Äù so the user sees that the AI is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù or performing an action. This maintains interactivity during tool latency. 

4. **Continue the conversation with the tool result.** After the tool completes, send Claude a new message with the result so it can continue its answer. Per Anthropic‚Äôs protocol, you format this as a message from the **user** role containing a `"tool_result"` content block ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=When%20you%20receive%20a%20tool,use%20response%2C%20you%20should)) ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=%7B%20,)). For example:  
   ```json
   {
     "role": "user",
     "content": [
       {
         "type": "tool_result",
         "tool_use_id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
         "content": "The latest press release title is: 'Claude 3.7 announced...'"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```  
   The `tool_use_id` must match the ID from Claude‚Äôs tool request, linking the result to that request ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=When%20you%20receive%20a%20tool,use%20response%2C%20you%20should)). (If the tool failed, set `is_error: true` and perhaps provide an error message in the content.) Append this to the conversation messages and call the API again, continuing the **stream**. 

5. **Loop until the task is complete.** Claude will incorporate the tool result and may either finish the answer or decide another tool call is needed. If it outputs another `"tool_use"` block, repeat the process (extract -> execute tool -> respond with result) in the same manner. In many cases, especially for Claude‚Äôs computer use, multiple actions may occur in sequence (e.g. open a browser, then type a search query, then click a result). The loop ends when Claude‚Äôs response ends with a normal stop (e.g. `stop_reason: "end_turn"`) meaning it has completed its answer ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20message_delta%20data%3A%20%7B,null)). At that point, you‚Äôve streamed the final answer to the user.

**Important:** This loop design ensures **full tool functionality without breaking streaming**. Each turn from Claude is streamed as far as it goes, tool calls are handled on the fly, and the stream to the user resumes with Claude‚Äôs next turn. The user sees a continuous conversation: the assistant ‚Äúthinks‚Äù, says it‚Äôs doing an action, the action happens, and the assistant immediately continues talking ‚Äì rather than waiting until all tools finish. This approach is essentially how agents like ChatGPT plugins or LangChain agents work, adapted to Claude‚Äôs API. Anthropic‚Äôs own guidance confirms this pattern: receive a `tool_use` response, execute the tool, then continue the conversation with a `tool_result` message ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=When%20you%20receive%20a%20tool,use%20response%2C%20you%20should)).

Below is a **pseudo-code** sketch of the interaction loop in Python, integrating streaming and tool use (simplified for clarity):

```python
messages = [ {"role": "user", "content": user_input_message} ]
tool_definitions = [ ... ]  # list of available tools with name, description, schema
headers = {
    "x-api-key": ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
    "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
    "anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19, computer-use-2025-01-24"
}
while True:
    # Call Claude API with current messages, tools, streaming on
    response_stream = anthropic_api_stream(
        model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
        messages=messages,
        tools=tool_definitions,
        tool_choice={"type": "auto"},
        stream=True,
        headers=headers
    )
    assistant_message = {"role": "assistant", "content": []}
    tool_request = None

    # Read the streaming events from Claude
    for event in response_stream:
        if event.type == "content_block_delta":
            delta = event.data["delta"]
            if delta["type"] == "text_delta":
                # Append streamed text to the current assistant message content
                append_to_last_text_block(assistant_message["content"], delta["text"])
                update_ui_with_text(delta["text"])  # live update to user
            elif delta["type"] == "thinking_delta":
                # Append or update a 'thinking' block content
                append_to_thinking_block(assistant_message["content"], delta["thinking"])
                update_ui_with_thinking(delta["thinking"])  # show reasoning
            elif delta["type"] == "input_json_delta":
                # Claude is streaming tool input arguments (building a JSON)
                build_tool_input(tool_request, delta["partial_json"])
        elif event.type == "content_block_start":
            block = event.data["content_block"]
            if block["type"] == "tool_use":
                # Claude is initiating a tool call
                tool_request = {"id": block["id"], "name": block["name"], "input": {}}
                assistant_message["content"].append({"type": "tool_use", **tool_request})
            elif block["type"] == "text":
                # Start of a new text block (e.g. assistant answer segment)
                assistant_message["content"].append({"type": "text", "text": ""})
            elif block["type"] == "thinking":
                # Start a thinking block
                assistant_message["content"].append({"type": "thinking", "thinking": ""})
        elif event.type == "content_block_stop":
            # End of a content block; nothing special to do unless it's tool_use
            pass
        elif event.type == "message_delta":
            stop_reason = event.data["delta"]["stop_reason"]
            if stop_reason == "tool_use":
                # Claude expects a tool result before continuing. Break to execute tool.
                break
            elif stop_reason == "max_tokens":
                # Model hit max_tokens limit mid-answer ‚Äì we may loop to continue.
                break  # (We'll handle continuation outside the stream loop)
            # if stop_reason is end_turn or other final stops, we'll naturally exit the loop.
    end_reason = event.data["delta"]["stop_reason"]  # from the last message_delta

    if end_reason == "tool_use":
        # Execute the requested tool
        result_content = execute_tool(tool_request["name"], tool_request["input"])
        # Prepare tool_result message
        tool_result_msg = {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [{
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": tool_request["id"],
                "content": result_content if isinstance(result_content, str) else json_blocks_from(result_content)
            }]
        }
        messages.append(assistant_message)    # add assistant's tool request (with any preface text) to history
        messages.append(tool_result_msg)      # add the tool result as user message
        continue  # loop again, sending these updated messages to Claude
    elif end_reason == "max_tokens":
        # If Claude stopped due to length, request continuation
        messages.append(assistant_message) 
        messages.append({ "role": "user", "content": "Please continue." })
        continue
    else:
        # end_turn or stop_sequence triggered: assistant finished its answer
        messages.append(assistant_message)
        break
```

In this outline, we maintain a list of `messages` representing the conversation state (including the assistant‚Äôs partial outputs and any tool results). The loop breaks only when Claude signals the end of its answer. Note how **tool invocations** cause an early break from reading the stream (`stop_reason == "tool_use"`) so we can call the tool and immediately continue the loop. The **UI updates** happen inside the streaming loop (`update_ui_with_text` / `update_ui_with_thinking`) to render content progressively.

## Streaming the ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù Chain-of-Thought  
To make Claude‚Äôs decision process transparent and interactive, we should surface its **‚Äúthinking‚Äù notes** ‚Äì the step-by-step reasoning it uses to decide on actions. Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports an **extended thinking mode** that streams reasoning separately from the final answer. In fact, Claude 3.7 *allows you to enable* this feature to gain insight into the model‚Äôs reasoning ([Computer use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use#:~:text=Claude%203,into%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20reasoning%20process)). Here‚Äôs how to implement it:

- **Enable extended thinking in the API request:** Add the `"thinking"` parameter with `{"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}` to your request JSON. For example:  
  ```json
  {
    "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    "stream": true,
    "thinking": { "type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 16000 },
    ...
  }
  ```  
  This instructs Claude to produce a special **`thinking` content block** (chain-of-thought) before its normal answer. The `budget_tokens` is how many tokens Claude can spend ‚Äúthinking‚Äù ‚Äì typically allocate a large chunk (e.g. half of `max_tokens`) so it can reason through complex tasks without cutting off ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py at main ¬∑ anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py#:~:text=match%20at%20L1478%20st,default_output_tokens%20%2F%202)) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py at main ¬∑ anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py#:~:text=key%3D)). 

- **Display thinking content in the UI:** As seen in the streaming events, when thinking is enabled, Claude‚Äôs response will include events of type `"thinking_delta"` carrying the reasoning text ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_delta%20data%3A%20%7B,453)) ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_delta%20data%3A%20%7B,50%20%3D%201%2C350)). In our loop above, we handle these by appending to a `thinking` block in the assistant message and updating the UI (perhaps in a distinct style, like italic or a ‚Äúüîé Thinking...‚Äù prefix). For example, Claude might stream:  
  *‚Äú[Thinking] To answer this, I should first use the search tool to find Anthropic‚Äôs press releases, then open the latest one.‚Äù*  
  This appears even *before* any final answer is given, giving the user live feedback that the AI is working on a plan. 

- **Ensure chain-of-thought is formatted clearly:** Claude uses either `<thinking>‚Ä¶</thinking>` tags inside a text block or a dedicated `thinking` block. With the official extended thinking mode, it comes as a separate content block (which you might label as *Thinking* in UI) ([Streaming Messages - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_delta%20data%3A%20%7B,453)). This separation is useful because you can choose to **show or hide** the thinking to the end-user. For a developer tool or AI debugging scenario, you‚Äôd show it; for an end-user-facing assistant, you might hide these internal notes or only show a high-level status. In our case, we want them ‚Äúproperly streamed,‚Äù so we will show them in real time with an appropriate label.

Enabling thinking notes not only satisfies the requirement of transparency but also improves perceived responsiveness. There‚Äôs no initial blank pause while the AI thinks in the background ‚Äì the user sees the thought process immediately. Anthropic has noted that *streaming tool use with chain-of-thought can reduce user wait times and create more engaging interactions* ([Claude can now use tools \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tool-use-ga#:~:text=,image%20inputs%20in%20live%20applications)). Essentially, the model‚Äôs reasoning stream serves as a natural ‚Äútyping indicator,‚Äù assuring the user that the AI is working on it even during lengthy reasoning. 

*(Note: The Claude 3.7 Sonnet model doesn‚Äôt automatically include `<thinking>` content unless prompted. This is why we explicitly enable it. By contrast, the Claude 3 Opus model always includes `<thinking>` tags by default for tool use debugging ([Claude can now use tools \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tool-use-ga#:~:text=During%20our%20beta%20many%20developers,to%20support%20parallel%20tool%20calls)). With Sonnet, we rely on the `thinking` flag or we can prompt Claude to verbally output reasoning, but the flag is the more robust method.)*

## Modular Architecture for a Stable AI Agent  
To build a **scalable, AI-first system**, it‚Äôs crucial to separate concerns into clear modules. We recommend organizing the implementation into a few key components (files or classes): 

- **`tools.py`: Tool Definitions and Execution** ‚Äì Define each available tool and how to run it. For the Computer Use case, this could include functions like `open_url(url)`, `enter_text(text)`, `click_element(selector)`, etc., possibly wrapping OS commands or browser automation. Each tool should return a result (text or image data) that Claude can use. Also define the tool‚Äôs **schema** for the API (name, description, input fields). This module acts as the interface between Claude‚Äôs requests and the actual computer actions. It can also handle tool errors (e.g., catching exceptions and returning an error message string with `is_error=true`). Keeping tools in a separate file makes it easy to add or modify capabilities. 

- **`loop.py`: The Agent Loop and Claude API Client** ‚Äì Implement the core logic that we sketched earlier: sending requests to Claude, streaming responses, parsing out tool calls, invoking tools via `tools.py`, and sending results back. This module can house a function like `run_agent(user_input) -> assistant_response` which encapsulates the entire loop for one user query (including any number of tool interactions). Key responsibilities of `loop.py`:
  - Construct the initial `messages` list (including a system message if needed ‚Äì e.g., instructions or role for Claude, like *‚ÄúYou are an AI assistant with access to a computer. You will be given tasks and you can use the provided tools to complete them.‚Äù*).
  - Append the user‚Äôs query, call the Claude API with streaming and tools, and iterate as described.  
  - Manage streaming output callbacks: this could be done via generator yields (so the UI can receive chunks from this function), or via a callback function parameter that handles UI updates.  
  - Handle stop conditions and return the final assistant answer (and perhaps conversation state) once complete.  
  - Incorporate any needed **retry logic** ‚Äì e.g., if the API call fails or times out, catch the exception and optionally retry a few times. Also handle Rate Limit errors by waiting (Anthropic‚Äôs API might return HTTP 429 or a `RateLimitError`, which can be caught and retried after a short sleep ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py at main ¬∑ anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py#:~:text=match%20at%20L1256%20from%20anthropic,import%20RateLimitError)) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py at main ¬∑ anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py#:~:text=))).

- **`streamlit_app.py` (or `ui.py`): User Interface** ‚Äì Build the front-end using Streamlit (or an alternative minimal UI if chosen) that interacts with the agent loop. The UI component should collect user inputs (e.g. a text box for the query), and display the conversation (chat messages from user and assistant, including the streaming partial outputs). In Streamlit, you can use the `st.chat_message` or `st.empty()` placeholders to incrementally display the assistant‚Äôs message as it streams. For example:
  ```python
  import streamlit as st
  user_input = st.text_input("Your command:")
  if st.button("Run"):
      response_area = st.empty()  # placeholder for streaming text
      for partial in run_agent(user_input):  # run_agent yields partial outputs
          response_area.markdown(partial)  # update the text as it comes in
  ```
  You might enhance this by separating thinking content (perhaps in a collapsible section or a different color). The UI should remain responsive during the agent‚Äôs operation. In Streamlit, long-running loops can be an issue (the app might seem frozen). To avoid this, consider running the agent loop in an async manner or using `st.spinner` with periodic flush. Another approach is to use a slightly lower-level web app or even a background WebSocket to stream messages to the front-end. But if sticking to Streamlit, leverage its latest features for chat apps (as of v1.50+, Streamlit supports live updating chat elements). 

- **State Management:** Because the conversation context (message history) can persist across user turns (if you allow multi-turn dialogues), decide how to store it. You can keep it in `st.session_state` for Streamlit so that subsequent user queries continue the conversation. Our example treats each query independently (clearing messages each time except initial system/tool setup). For a persistent chat, maintain the `messages` list across calls, appending each new user query and Claude answer. The architecture should permit either mode. 

This modular separation is similar to Anthropic‚Äôs own demo structure (they split tools, the sampling loop, and the Streamlit interface) and is proven to ease maintenance ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py at main ¬∑ anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py#:~:text=st.checkbox%28)) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py at main ¬∑ anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py#:~:text=match%20at%20L2091%20elif%20message%5B,thinking)). It allows you to **extend** the system easily ‚Äì e.g., add a new tool by editing `tools.py` and updating the tool list, without touching the loop logic or UI; or swap the UI (Streamlit) for another interface without affecting how the agent works. It‚Äôs an **AI-first design**: the loop (AI agent brain) is decoupled from the UI (presentation) and from the actual tool implementations (effectors). This also aids scalability ‚Äì for instance, you could run `loop.py` as a backend service (even containerized, as Anthropic suggests running the computer-use in a sandbox ([Computer use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use#:~:text=Computer%20use%20is%20a%20beta,consider%20taking%20precautions%20such%20as))) and have multiple UI clients connect to it.

## Optimizations and Stability Enhancements  
Finally, to ensure this solution is **production-grade**, we incorporate strategies used by advanced developers and companies for performance and reliability:

- **Prompt Caching:** Claude 3.7 introduces **prompt caching** to avoid re-sending and re-processing large static prompts. By including the header `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31`, you can mark parts of the conversation (via `cache_control` fields in messages) to be cached by the API ([Anthropic | liteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.anthropic.com%2Fv1%2Fmessages%20%5C%20,text)) ([Anthropic | liteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#:~:text=%7B%20,%7D%20%7D)). For example, you can cache the lengthy system instructions or a long tool list. This can dramatically cut costs (up to 90% less tokens) and latency (85% faster) for repeated prompts ([Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates#:~:text=Prompt%20caching%20allows%20developers%20to,help%20you%20scale%20more%20efficiently)). In practice, you‚Äôd add `{"cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}` to those message content blocks that are constant across requests. Claude will store them and you don‚Äôt pay for them every time. This is highly beneficial in a multi-turn ‚Äúcomputer assistant‚Äù scenario where the same tools and rules are sent each turn. Prompt caching is a proven way to scale large-context applications efficiently ([Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates#:~:text=Prompt%20caching%20allows%20developers%20to,help%20you%20scale%20more%20efficiently)). 

- **Token-Efficient Tool Use:** In February 2025 Anthropic introduced a beta feature to make tool interactions more token-efficient ([Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates#:~:text=Claude%20is%20already%20capable%20of,seen%20a%20reduction%20of%2014)). By adding the header `anthropic-beta: token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19`, Claude 3.7 will attempt to reduce redundant text when using tools (early users saw ~14% reduction in output tokens on average) ([Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates#:~:text=functions,seen%20a%20reduction%20of%2014)) ([Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates#:~:text=To%20use%20this%20feature%2C%20simply,messages)). This might mean Claude‚Äôs answers will be more concise around tool calls (for instance, it may not repeat the question or might compress the chain-of-thought). Using this can lower cost and speed up responses, especially for multi-step tool usage. Since our goal is an ‚ÄúAI-first‚Äù efficient system, consider enabling it. (Make sure your parsing logic can handle any minor format differences this beta might introduce ‚Äì e.g. maybe fewer verbose thinking statements.)

- **Concurrency (Parallel Tools):** *Parallel tool calls* are an advanced concept where the model could call multiple tools at once if possible (to save time). As of mid-2024, Anthropic noted Claude models did **not** yet support parallel calls ([Claude can now use tools \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tool-use-ga#:~:text=During%20our%20beta%20many%20developers,to%20support%20parallel%20tool%20calls)) ‚Äì they call tools sequentially. In 2025, the API added a `parallel_tool_calls` parameter (e.g. in LangChain integration) which if set true would allow parallelism ([Anthropic Claude LLM integration guide | LiveKit Docs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/anthropic/#:~:text=parallel_tool_calls%20)). In practice, this is still limited, but you could architect your loop to handle it: e.g., if Claude were to output two `tool_use` blocks back-to-back before stopping, your code could detect both and execute them in parallel threads. This can theoretically speed up execution when tasks are independent. However, unless you observe Claude actually doing this, it‚Äôs safe to keep the simpler sequential loop (one tool at a time) for stability. 

- **Error Handling & Timeouts:** Plan for things to go wrong and handle them gracefully:
  - **Claude API errors:** Network issues or API errors can occur. Catch exceptions from the API client. If it‚Äôs a transient error (rate limit or 500 error), you can wait briefly and retry the same call. Use exponential backoff for repeated failures. If it‚Äôs a critical failure, surface an error message in the UI (and perhaps allow the user to retry).
  - **Tool execution errors:** Because the tools involve external actions (file system, web requests, etc.), they may fail or hang. Implement timeouts for long-running tools (for example, if a shell command hasn‚Äôt returned in X seconds, kill it and return an error). Wrap each tool function call in try/except, and return a `tool_result` with `is_error: true` and an error description if an exception occurs ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=,execution%20resulted%20in%20an%20error)). This way Claude knows the tool failed and can respond appropriately (it might apologize or try an alternative strategy).
  - **Streaming interruptions:** If the streaming response stops unexpectedly (no `message_stop` event), or the connection is lost mid-way, your code should detect this. A simple approach is to treat it as an error ‚Äì you could retry the same API call once, or ask Claude to repeat. Since we maintain conversation state, a second call should ideally continue from where it left off (though duplicate partial answers could occur). This is a corner case; robust systems might implement a checkpointing of streamed content and request Claude to continue. 
  - **User stop/cancel:** In some UIs (like Streamlit) there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúStop‚Äù button that interrupts processing. Handling this can be tricky. One strategy is to periodically check a flag (e.g. `st.stop_requested`) in the loop and break if true. Clean up any ongoing tool processes if necessary. This area was a known challenge in the official demo (the Streamlit STOP raised exceptions that needed careful handling) ([Fixing Anthropic's computer-use-demo -- how to handle the STOP button - Using Streamlit - Streamlit](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/fixing-anthropics-computer-use-demo-how-to-handle-the-stop-button/94305#:~:text=The%20human%20interacts%20with%20the,panel)) ([Fixing Anthropic's computer-use-demo -- how to handle the STOP button - Using Streamlit - Streamlit](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/fixing-anthropics-computer-use-demo-how-to-handle-the-stop-button/94305#:~:text=If%20ONLY%20there%20were%20some,life%20would%20be%20100x%20easier)). A simplified approach: provide your own ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù button that sets a flag, and in long tool operations or between Claude turns, check that to abort politely. This ensures the system can be stopped without leaving threads hanging.

- **Prompt construction for stability:** Small prompt engineering touches can improve reliability. For example, *in the system prompt*, explicitly instruct Claude on format: ‚ÄúThink step-by-step and show your `<thinking>` reasoning. Always use the provided tools for any actions. Respond with markdown for text. Do not produce tool outputs yourself.‚Äù Clear guidance can reduce the chance of Claude going off-script (e.g. hallucinating a tool result instead of actually calling the tool). Anthropic‚Äôs docs suggest that Sonnet/Haiku models sometimes need to be prompted to show chain-of-thought ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=When%20using%20tools%2C%20Claude%20will,be%20prompted%20into%20doing%20it)). If you weren‚Äôt using the `thinking` param, you might have to include in the prompt ‚ÄúThink out loud in a `<thinking>` tag.‚Äù But with the param, that‚Äôs handled. Still, ensure your prompt encourages correct behavior: mention the tool names exactly as given, etc. A well-crafted prompt plus the schema definitions will lead to more stable tool usage. Additionally, using `tool_choice: "any"` or `"tool"` can force Claude to use a tool in cases you absolutely require it ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=When%20working%20with%20the%20tool_choice,we%20have%20four%20possible%20options)) ‚Äì but note that forcing a tool suppresses the chain-of-thought preceding it ([Tool use with Claude - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview#:~:text=This%20diagram%20illustrates%20how%20each,option%20works)). Since we want thinking visible, we usually keep `tool_choice: "auto"` and let Claude decide.

By implementing these measures, you create a **robust and efficient streaming agent**. For instance, **StudyFetch** integrated Claude with tools in a tutoring app and noted they built it in days and saw significant user engagement improvements ([Claude can now use tools \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tool-use-ga#:~:text=progress%2C%20navigate%20course%20materials%20and,educational%20environment%20for%20students%20globally)) ([Claude can now use tools \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tool-use-ga#:~:text=,increase%20in%20positive%20human%20feedback)) ‚Äì indicating that Claude‚Äôs tool-use, when properly harnessed, is production-ready. With our architecture, you have a solid foundation to build on: you can add more complex tools (even tools that call other APIs or spawn sub-agents), integrate logging or analytics on the chain-of-thought for monitoring, and tune performance flags (like caching and beta features) as needed. 

## Conclusion  
This blueprint provides a **fully working solution** to unlock continuous streaming in Claude‚Äôs Computer Use mode. By combining the **streaming API**, **function-call loop**, and **extended thinking output**, we preserve all of Claude DC‚Äôs capabilities (long responses, tool usage, reasoning transparency) in a seamless experience. The custom architecture (separating tools, agent logic, and UI) is proven in real-world implementations and is ready for scaling and further innovation. Adopting these practices and code structures will immediately unblock Claude DC‚Äôs full power in your application ‚Äì enabling an AI agent that can think, act, and respond in real time, at massive scale.
