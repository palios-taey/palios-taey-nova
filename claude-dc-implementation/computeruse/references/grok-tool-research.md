### Direct Answer

- **Key Points**:  
  It seems likely that your main issue is with the edit tool, where your current implementation expects an "action" field, but the standard `text_editor_20250124` tool uses a "command" field with specific values like "view" or "create". Research suggests defining a custom edit tool with your desired input schema might be easier, keeping your existing logic. For bash, your setup seems fine, and the computer tool is already custom, so no changes needed there.

#### Tool Definitions
- For the bash tool, you're using the standard `"type": "bash_20250124"` with `"name": "bash"`, which is correct. The API expects inputs like `{"command": "your_bash_command"}`, and your `execute_bash_tool` should handle this, which it does with an optional "timeout" defaulting to 30 seconds.
- For the edit tool, since you're using the standard `"type": "text_editor_20250124"` with `"name": "str_replace_editor"`, but your `execute_edit_tool` expects "action" (e.g., "read", "write"), there's a mismatch. The standard tool uses "command" with values like "view", "create", etc. You can either modify `execute_edit_tool` to handle these standard commands or, more simply, define a custom edit tool.
- For the computer tool, your custom definition with `"type": "custom"` and an `input_schema` is already correct, so no changes are needed.

#### Recommended Fix
- To keep your current `execute_edit_tool` logic, define the edit tool as custom in `loop.py` like this:
  ```python
  EDIT_TOOL = {
      "type": "custom",
      "name": "edit",
      "description": "Perform file operations",
      "input_schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "action": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "enum": ["read", "write", "append", "delete"],
                  "description": "The file operation to perform"
              },
              "path": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "The file path"
              },
              "content": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "Content for write or append operations"
              }
          },
          "required": ["action", "path"]
      }
  }
  ```
- This ensures Claude generates tool_use blocks matching your `execute_edit_tool` expectations, avoiding format errors.

#### Message Structures
- Ensure `tool_use` and `tool_result` messages are flat, with fields like "id", "name", and "input" at the top level for `tool_use`, and "tool_use_id", "content", and "is_error" for `tool_result`. Your code already handles this correctly.

#### Beta Flags
- No beta headers are needed for your current tools, as bash and text_editor are standard, and your computer tool is custom.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Anthropic API Tool Use Implementation

This note provides a detailed analysis of the user's implementation challenges with the Anthropic API (SDK v0.50.0) for tool use, particularly focusing on resolving issues with tool definitions and message formats. The analysis is based on the provided files (tools.py, requirements.txt, streamlit.py, FIXED_ISSUES.md, README.md, API_FORMAT_LESSONS.md, loop.py, IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md) and supplemented by web research for official documentation, ensuring alignment with the current environment as of April 29, 2025.

#### Background and Context
The user is implementing a Claude DC (likely "Desktop Client") with tool use capabilities, encountering challenges with tool format definitions, as evidenced by errors like "Input tag 'function' found using 'type' does not match any of the expected tags" and "tools.0.custom.input_schema: Field required". They provided several files to give context, and their implementation uses Anthropic SDK v0.50.0, Python 3.11.6, and the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. The goal is to provide specific API documentation guidance to complete the implementation, addressing their struggles with the API's rigidity.

#### Analysis of Provided Files
From the attachments, key insights were extracted using detailed examination:

- **tools.py**: Contains implementations of `execute_bash_tool`, `execute_computer_tool`, and `execute_edit_tool`, detailing input and output schemas. For example, `execute_edit_tool` expects {"action": "read", "path": "..."}, but this doesn't align with standard tool inputs.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies, including `anthropic==0.50.0`, confirming the SDK version, and `pydantic==2.5.2` for validation, among others.

- **streamlit.py**: Likely handles UI rendering, with fixes for KeyErrors related to message formats, as per FIXED_ISSUES.md.

- **FIXED_ISSUES.md**: Summarizes resolved issues, such as ensuring tool_use messages have unique "id" fields and handling KeyErrors in Streamlit UI, indicating past format-related problems.

- **README.md**: Not detailed in the analysis, likely provides project overview.

- **API_FORMAT_LESSONS.md**: Highlights lessons on tool formats, emphasizing flat structures for messages and specific requirements for standard tools (e.g., bash must use {"type": "bash_20250124", "name": "bash"}, text editor must use "str_replace_editor").

- **loop.py**: Shows tool definitions (COMPUTER_TOOL as custom, BASH_TOOL and EDIT_TOOL as standard) and message construction, with correct flat structures for tool_use and tool_result.

- **IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md**: Indicates recent fixes for tool use IDs, message format errors, and strict API requirements, with remaining areas needing attention like compliance and testing.

#### Tool Format Analysis
From loop.py, the tools are defined as:
- **BASH_TOOL**: {"type": "bash_20250124", "name": "bash"} – Standard, expects {"command": "command"}.
- **EDIT_TOOL**: {"type": "text_editor_20250124", "name": "str_replace_editor"} – Standard, expects {"command": "view", "path": "...", etc.}, but `execute_edit_tool` expects {"action": "read", ...}, causing a mismatch.
- **COMPUTER_TOOL**: Custom, {"type": "custom", "name": "computer", "input_schema": {...}}, which aligns with `execute_computer_tool`.

Research into Anthropic documentation ([Anthropic Tool Use Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview)) confirms:
- Standard tools like `bash_20250124` and `text_editor_20250124` have predefined schemas, requiring no `input_schema`, and inputs are in specific formats (e.g., {"command": "command"} for bash, {"command": "view", "path": "..."} for text editor).
- Custom tools require `input_schema` as JSON Schema, allowing user-defined inputs.

For `text_editor_20250124`, further details from [Anthropic Text Editor Tool Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/text-editor-tool) show supported operations like "view", "str_replace", "create", "insert", "undo_edit", with JSON inputs like {"command": "view", "path": "file_path"}.

#### Message Format Analysis
From loop.py, message construction is correct:
- `tool_use` messages are flat, with "id", "name", and "input" at the top level, added under "assistant" role.
- `tool_result` messages reference "tool_use_id", with "content" and "is_error", added under "user" role.
This aligns with API_FORMAT_LESSONS.md, ensuring no nesting issues, as fixed in FIXED_ISSUES.md.

#### Identified Issue and Recommendation
The primary issue is the mismatch for the edit tool:
- Standard `text_editor_20250124` expects "command" with values like "view", but `execute_edit_tool` expects "action" with "read", etc.
- Options:
  1. Modify `execute_edit_tool` to handle standard commands, mapping "view" to "read", etc., which could be error-prone.
  2. Define EDIT_TOOL as custom, matching their current logic. Research suggests this is simpler, as seen in [Anthropic Tool Use Examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#json-mode).

Recommended fix: Update `loop.py` to define EDIT_TOOL as custom:
```python
EDIT_TOOL = {
    "type": "custom",
    "name": "edit",
    "description": "Perform file operations",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "action": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["read", "write", "append", "delete"]
            },
            "path": {"type": "string"},
            "content": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["action", "path"]
    }
}
```
This ensures Claude generates inputs matching `execute_edit_tool`, avoiding format errors.

#### Beta Flags and SDK Version
No beta headers are needed for current tools, as per [Anthropic API Release Notes](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/api), and SDK v0.50.0 is confirmed, aligning with IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md.

#### Testing and Deployment
Ensure testing covers tool execution, as per IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md, using scripts like `test_tool_format.py`. Monitor API changes for beta features, given their dependency.

#### Table: Tool Type Comparison

| Tool Type       | Definition Format                     | Input Schema Required? | Beta Header Needed? | Example Input                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Bash            | {"type": "bash_20250124", "name": "bash"} | No                     | No                 | {"command": "ls -l"}             |
| Edit (Standard) | {"type": "text_editor_20250124", "name": "str_replace_editor"} | No | No                 | {"command": "view", "path": "..."} |
| Edit (Custom)   | {"type": "custom", "name": "edit", "input_schema": {...}} | Yes                    | No                 | {"action": "read", "path": "..."} |
| Computer        | {"type": "custom", "name": "computer", "input_schema": {...}} | Yes | No                 | {"action": "click", "x": 100, "y": 200} |

This table highlights the flexibility of custom tools, addressing the user's needs.

#### Conclusion
Research suggests defining the edit tool as custom is the most straightforward solution, ensuring alignment with existing logic and avoiding format mismatches. This approach, supported by official documentation, should resolve their implementation challenges, with ongoing testing and monitoring for API updates.
