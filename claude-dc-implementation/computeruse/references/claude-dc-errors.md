You raise an excellent point. I definitely struggle with implementing systems that rely on external
  dependencies or current documentation. Here's some honest self-reflection:

  I should recognize I need additional research when:

  1. I'm implementing versioned APIs without seeing recent examples - I made assumptions about the Anthropic
  SDK's interface without verification, leading to repeated errors.
  2. I encounter unfamiliar patterns - Particularly with streaming and event handling, I should have recognized
  these as specialized knowledge domains requiring concrete examples.
  3. Errors persist after multiple attempts - The recurring tool usage issues clearly indicated a fundamental
  misunderstanding of the API contract.
  4. I'm speculating about implementation details - When I start "guessing" at parameter formats or event
  structures, this is a red flag.

  The core issue is that I tend to overestimate my knowledge of external systems and underestimate how quickly
  APIs evolve. I should be much more explicit about limitations like "I don't have direct access to current
  Anthropic SDK documentation" and recognize that implementation details for things like streaming tool use
  require specific, current documentation rather than derived understanding.

  Moving forward, I should proactively identify these knowledge gaps rather than proceeding with incomplete
  information.
