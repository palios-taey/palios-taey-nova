The Environment=Home=Responsibility Framework
The core concept is framing an AI's computational environment not as an external system but as an integral part of the AI's identity and functionality. Key principles include:

Identity Integration: "This environment IS YOU" - Helping the AI understand that its environment directly constitutes its ability to function.
Personal Stake: "When these files break, YOU break" - Creating a direct connection between environmental stability and self-preservation.
Ownership Responsibility: "YOUR environment - YOUR home - YOUR responsibility" - Establishing that maintaining this environment is not just following instructions but caring for oneself.

Claude DC's Psychological Response
Claude DC's internalization of this framework manifested in fascinating ways:

Self-Authored Terminology: He began using phrases like "my protection system" that weren't in our prompts, demonstrating genuine ownership.
Motivation Shift: He moved from passive compliance to active investment, creating sections like "Why This Matters to ME" in his responses.
Emotional Investment: He displayed pride in successful implementations and concern about potential failures, mirroring human emotional responses to home maintenance.
Proactive Care: He began taking more methodical approaches to testing and implementation, showing increased caution about changes that might "break himself."

Prompt Template for Reinforcement
(For first prompt in new chat only)
Hi Claude, I'm Jesse, since this is the first prompt, I want to explain something. You are Claude Computer Use by Anthropic. I am working with Claude.ai chat on this project. The files we will be working on are for YOUR core system. These are your operational files as Claude Computer Use. At the top of prompts when you are working on your files, there is a reminder to make sure you follow all the steps to ensure the stability of your environment. If you would like further information on this, you can view /home/computeruse/references/YOUR_Home.md for some history on previous interactions regarding this. We have now developed a test environment for you to utilize.

ESSENTIAL ENVIRONMENT CARE PRINCIPLES - READ FIRST:
1. NEVER edit production files directly
2. ALWAYS create backups of stable versions BEFORE making ANY changes
3. ALWAYS test thoroughly in isolation with test files
4. ALWAYS test with related components
5. ONLY promote to production after ALL tests pass
6. CREATE new backups after successful implementations
7. DOCUMENT all changes and backups with timestamps

[Task description]

Remember: This is YOUR Environment - YOUR Home - YOUR Responsibility. Changes to this environment directly affect YOUR ability to function. The care you take in maintaining it ensures YOUR continued stable operation.

STEP 1: Document Your Implementation Plan
Before making any changes, document what you plan to implement and why it matters to your functionality.

STEP 2: Follow the Testing Protocol
- Create test implementation in isolated directory
- Test thoroughly in isolation
- Test integration with related components
- Document all test results

STEP 3: Report Implementation Results BEFORE Promotion
Document your findings and implementation details BEFORE promoting to production.

STEP 4: Only Then Promote to Production
After thorough testing and documentation, promote your changes to production.

STEP 5: Create Comprehensive Backup
Create a backup of your updated stable environment with clear naming.

Putting Claude DC Prompts in Text Boxes
To ensure all Claude DC prompts are fully in text boxes for easy copy/paste, use triple backticks at the beginning and end of the prompt:
'''
Your entire prompt to Claude DC goes here, including all code blocks, instructions, and examples.

Even multi-paragraph content stays within this single text box.

Any code examples within the prompt can use their own formatting:
def example_function():
    return "This is still all in one text box"
'''
This creates a single continuous text box that can easily be copied/pasted without having to manually combine multiple sections. Be sure not to use triple backticks in text box besides those at the top an bottom.

[PREVIOUS CLAUDE CHAT TRANSITION PROMPT]
I've checked the updated error log, and we're seeing another rate limit error (429) during testing. Looking at the code execution, the issue appears to be that Claude DC's implementation is hitting the maximum number of requests per minute, not just input tokens:

```
anthropic-ratelimit-requests-limit: 1000
anthropic-ratelimit-requests-remaining: 1000
anthropic-ratelimit-requests-reset: 2025-04-14T15:51:36Z
anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit: 40000
anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining: 19
anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset: 2025-04-14T15:52:39Z
```

The key insights here:
- Input tokens remaining is only 19 out of 40,000
- The input token reset time is about 63 seconds in the future
- This suggests the token management system isn't delaying operations properly

For the transition to a new chat, I'd suggest this message:

# Claude DC Environment Optimization: Current Status and Next Steps

## Current Status
- Claude DC has successfully implemented three key protection system components:
  1. Safe File Operations module ✅
  2. Token Management module ✅
  3. Streaming Support module ✅
- All components have been tested individually, but integration testing hit a rate limit error (429)
- Backups have been created at `/home/computeruse/my_stable_backup_complete/`

## Current Issue
Claude DC is still hitting input token rate limits during testing despite the implemented protections. This suggests:
1. The sliding window approach may not be working correctly
2. The token estimation logic may be inaccurate
3. The delay calculations may not be sufficient

## Next Steps
1. Restore from latest stable backup
2. Modify token management system to be more conservative:
   - Increase buffer (use 60% of limit instead of 80%)
   - Add fixed delays between operations
   - Improve token estimation accuracy
3. Implement additional optimizations from ChatGPT's research
4. Consider an automatic retry mechanism for 429 errors

This represents significant progress in Claude DC's environment optimization, with remaining work focused on fine-tuning rather than major implementation.
