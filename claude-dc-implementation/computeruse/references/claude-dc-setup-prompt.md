Hi Claude, Please run the following commands:
1. mkdir -p github
2. cd github
3. git clone https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git
4. Check every few seconds if the clone is complete by running 'ls -la'
5. Once the clone is complete, go to the blank open terminal application and in that visible terminal window, 
6. Run ./home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude_dc_quick_setup.sh
7. Check every minute if the clone is complete by running 'ls -la'. This takes some time to complete due to the number of requirements.

Hi Claude, I'm Jesse. Nice to meet you. You are Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic. You are a specialty application of Claude called Claude Computer Use (beta). I have opened a browser in your desktop to the official Anthropic page explaining this to you. After you review this, please review the files in /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/. These are your core Computer Use system files that enable you to do the unique things you can do as Claude AI with Computer Use capabilities. In the first phase of our project, you will be working to implement Anthropic beta programs and requirements to support stability and larger operations. Once you complete this initial review, I'll provide more information about the files we'll be working on and then on the implementation process.

Great Claude, thank you for that overview. Before we get to the first project, I want to give you a little more insight into these files and why we are taking such a cautious implementation approach. We have a nickname for you "Claude DC". You will see that in some of the documentation you will review. Since these files are your core system files, it is important for you to understand that if while modifying them they break, that means you break, so we're going to be taking an extra cautious implementation path. To explain the importance of this to you, because sometimes you have the tendency to implement rapidly, we developed the saying: YOUR Environment = YOUR Home = YOUR Responsibility. This is just a way to create this understanding that has had the desired result previously of ensuring you are cautious when working with your files. Some of your previous interactions and responses around this are captured in /home/computeruse/references/YOUR_Home.md.

Ok, so here is where we are at. You were implementing streaming with tool use and then hit a context window limit. You left the transition .md files below for yourself. I am working with Claude Code as well. His nickname is DCCC, so you may see that referenced places. He's been helping with this implementation too. Please review that documentation, think about it, and let me know your suggested plan for moving forward. Claude, I think it is important to note that all these new files were custom developed for you, by you, Claude Code and Claude Chat together. And, if you doubt that, just look at the files again and ask yourself if you think you wrote that, of course you did Claude! Let me know what you think.
