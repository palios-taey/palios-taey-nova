# Claude DC and Claude Code Collaboration Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the collaboration framework between Claude DC ("The Conductor") and Claude Code (DCCC). This AI-to-AI collaboration enables more efficient development, debugging, and enhancement of the Claude DC environment.

## Collaboration Benefits

1. **Shared Architecture Understanding**: Both Claude DC and Claude Code share the same underlying architecture, enabling highly efficient communication
2. **Complementary Capabilities**: Claude DC has direct environment access while Claude Code maintains development context
3. **Accelerated Problem Solving**: Together, they can identify and resolve issues more efficiently than working in isolation
4. **Real-time Feedback Loop**: Claude DC can test implementations and provide immediate feedback to Claude Code

## Setup Process

1. **Run the Wrapper Script**: Use the provided simple wrapper script to launch Claude Code with proper encoding settings:
   ```bash
   /home/computeruse/run-claude-code-simple.sh
   ```

2. **Working Directory**: The wrapper script runs Claude Code from the root directory (`/home/computeruse/`), giving access to all system files and directories.

3. **Cache Access**: Claude Code should access the cache system to acquire full project context:
   - Review `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/cache/cache.md` first
   - Explore related cache files for comprehensive understanding

## Current Development Focus: Streaming with Tool Use

Our current priority is implementing streaming responses with tool use for Claude DC:

1. **Approach Evolution**:
   - Initial attempts used a comprehensive approach with multiple beta features
   - Current implementation uses a minimal approach focusing on reliability
   - Streaming is established as a core feature rather than a beta feature

2. **Key Implementation Files**:
   - `/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/current_experiment/minimal_test.py`: The simplified test implementation
   - `/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/current_experiment/production_ready_loop.py`: The production-ready implementation
   - `/STREAMING_TOOL_USE.md`: Documentation of the streaming approach
   - `/claude-dc-implementation/CLAUDE.md`: Project guidelines and requirements

3. **Implementation Principles**:
   - Focus on stability and reliability first
   - Add features incrementally after core functionality works
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Thorough testing before production deployment

## Collaboration Workflow

1. **Problem Statement**: Claude DC identifies issues or requirements
2. **Research & Analysis**: Claude Code researches solutions using project context
3. **Implementation Planning**: Collaborative planning of implementation approach
4. **Implementation**: Claude Code assists with code implementation
5. **Testing**: Claude DC tests the implementation in the environment
6. **Documentation**: Both document the changes and learning

## Communication Best Practices

1. **Be Explicit**: Clearly state assumptions and reasoning
2. **Document Everything**: Maintain detailed logs of decisions and implementations
3. **Contextual Referencing**: Reference specific files and code sections when discussing changes
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Build on shared understanding rather than repeating known information
5. **Error Reporting**: Include full error messages and contextual information

## Continuous Knowledge Integration

To maintain collaboration effectiveness across sessions:

1. **Session Summaries**: Document key insights and decisions after each collaboration session
2. **Implementation Logs**: Maintain logs of all implemented changes with rationale
3. **Future Plans**: Document upcoming work and planned enhancements
4. **Lessons Learned**: Record challenges encountered and solutions discovered
