# Claude DC Streaming Implementation

## Overview
This update adds reliable streaming functionality to Claude DC. The implementation:

1. Makes streaming a core feature that's always enabled by default
2. Simplifies the handling of beta flags to avoid compatibility issues
3. Ensures tool use works properly with streaming responses

## Key Changes

### 1. Simplified API Integration
- Removed conditional streaming logic, now streaming is always enabled
- Added robust error handling for beta flags and thinking parameters
- Made the streaming code more resilient to SDK version differences

### 2. Tool Integration
- Ensured tools work properly during streaming
- Added support for streaming tool outputs in real-time

### 3. Configuration
- Set ENABLE_STREAMING to default to True in the configuration

## Testing
The implementation was thoroughly tested with a minimal approach to ensure reliability:
1. First verified streaming worked without beta flags
2. Then tested streaming with tool use
3. Finally integrated the full streaming implementation with beta features

## Usage
Streaming is now automatically enabled for all Claude DC interactions.
Tools will work correctly during streaming, with outputs shown in real-time.
