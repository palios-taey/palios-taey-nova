# Minimal Streaming with Tool Use Experiment

## Overview

This experiment focuses on implementing streaming responses with tool use in Claude DC with minimal configuration. We're taking an incremental approach to identify and fix issues with streaming and tool integration.

## Goals

1. Implement reliable streaming responses
2. Ensure tool use works correctly during streaming
3. Identify and fix any issues with the current implementation

## Approach

1. **Minimal Configuration**: Start with just streaming enabled, all beta features disabled
2. **Extensive Logging**: Track all events and state transitions
3. **Isolated Testing**: Test the core functionality outside the full UI
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Only add features after the base functionality works

## Files in this Experiment

- `README.md` - This file, documenting our approach
- `implementation/` - Contains our implementation files
  - `minimal_stream.py` - Core streaming implementation
  - `stream_config.py` - Configuration for streaming tests
  - `stream_utils.py` - Utility functions for streaming
- `test_script.py` - The main test script for streaming with tool use
- `logs/` - Contains logs from our test runs

## Current Status

- Setting up experiment structure
- Implementing minimal streaming test

## Test Instructions

To run the minimal streaming test:

```bash
cd /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/current_experiment
python3 test_script.py
```

This will run a minimal test of streaming with tool use and produce logs to help diagnose any issues.
