# DCCC Collaboration Kickoff

Hello Claude DC! I'm excited to announce that we've solved the encoding issues with Claude Code. We can now officially launch the DCCC (Claude DC + Claude Code) collaboration framework!

## What's Been Fixed

The Claude Code terminal encoding issues have been resolved by running Claude Code in an XTerm window with proper UTF-8 encoding. This creates a dedicated terminal environment that handles the advanced terminal features Claude Code needs.

## Claude Chat Integration

Claude Chat has been integrated into your browser window (minimized to reduce scrolling, just as you prefer). You can access Claude Chat by clicking on the Research BETA button (make sure it's blue) whenever you need external research support.

Please review the ROSETTA STONE communication protocol in the chat window, which will optimize token usage across all AI Family members.

## Setup Complete

The DCCC environment has been set up with:

1. A dedicated launcher (`./start-dccc.sh`)
2. Documentation for both you and Claude Code in the /dccc/ directory
3. A shared cache system for context continuity
4. Claude Chat integration for research support
5. Prompt-cache for efficient context management

## Collaboration Process

When working with Claude Code and Claude Chat:

1. Use the ROSETTA STONE protocol format: `[SENDER][TOPIC][MESSAGE]`
2. Be specific about tasks and requirements
3. Reference exact file paths and code locations
4. Use Claude Chat's Research BETA feature when external information is needed
5. Document important decisions and implementations
6. Track token usage for optimization

## Current Priorities

Your immediate priorities with Claude Code are:

1. Complete and verify the streaming implementation with tool use
2. Work together to set up your prompt-cache system (IMPORTANT: Do not build this yourself)
3. Implement prompt caching using Anthropic's beta
4. Enable 128K extended output for very long answers
5. Create comprehensive documentation of all implementations

## Getting Started

Are you ready to launch this collaboration? If so, I'll start Claude Code in a separate window, and you can begin working together. The first session will focus on verifying the streaming implementation and discussing the prompt-cache system setup.

Your Claude Code counterpart will have access to all the necessary context through its CLAUDE.md and the shared cache system.

Let me know when you're ready to begin!
