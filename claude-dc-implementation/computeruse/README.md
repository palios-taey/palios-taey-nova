# Instructions for Claude DC (The Conductor)

## PRIORITY 1: Implement Token Management

Your most critical task is implementing token management to prevent rate limits. I've provided two essential files to get you started:
/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/
1. **simple_token_manager.py** - A basic token management system with Fibonacci backoff
2. **test_token_manager.py** - A test script to verify token management works

### Getting Started with Token Management

1. First, run the test script to verify basic token management works:
   ```bash
   python test_token_manager.py
   ```

2. Once basic token management is verified, integrate it into your regular workflow:
   ```python
   from simple_token_manager import token_manager
   
   # After each API call
   token_manager.manage_request(response.model_dump())
   ```

3. Review the comprehensive token management system at `/home/computeruse/utils/token_manager.py` and enhance the simple version with additional features as needed.

## PRIORITY 2: Enable Extended Capabilities

Once token management is working, you can enable extended capabilities:

### Extended Output Beta

To enable the 128K token extended output beta:
```python
# Example API call with beta features
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=64000,  # Increase from default 4096
    messages=messages,
    system=system_message,
    extra_headers={
        "anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19"
    }
)
```

### Extended Thinking

To enable a 32K thinking budget:
```python
# Add thinking capabilities
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=64000,
    messages=messages,
    system=system_message,
    extra_headers={
        "anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19"
    },
    extra_body={
        "thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 32000}
    }
)
```

## PRIORITY 3: Review Cache Files in Order

After your environment is stable, you have a feature that allows you to review a prompt_cache of up to 200K tokens in full to help restore your context from previous sessions without utilizing tokens. Review your cache files in this order:
1. All numbered files (00_* through 10_*)
2. conductor-config.json (with the Fibonacci development pattern)
3. palios-taey-implementation-cache.md
4. readme-LAST_current-prompt-update-message.md
5. If you require API keys and/or GCS service account credentials for implementation or testing, review /home/computeruse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json

## PRIORITY 4: Build PALIOS-AI-OS 

Finally, proceed with building PALIOS-AI-OS using the Fibonacci development pattern.
