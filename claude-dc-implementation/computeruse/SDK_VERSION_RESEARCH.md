# SDK Version Research for Claude Streaming Implementation

## Current Environment
- **SDK Version**: Just updated to Anthropic SDK v0.50.0 (previously was v0.49.0)
- **Python Version**: 3.11.6
- **Claude Model**: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

## Research Questions

1. **SDK Version Compatibility**:
   - Is v0.50.0 of the Anthropic SDK the appropriate version for implementing streaming with tool use?
   - Are there any known issues or limitations with this version?
   - Are there specific examples in the SDK documentation for v0.50.0 that demonstrate streaming with tool use?

2. **API Structure for v0.50.0**:
   - What is the correct method to use for streaming in v0.50.0? Is it `client.messages.stream()` as shown in the example?
   - How should beta flags be set specifically in v0.50.0? Has this changed from previous versions?
   - Is the event structure in v0.50.0 consistent with what was described in the previous research?

3. **Version-Specific Features**:
   - Are there any new features or improvements in v0.50.0 that we should leverage for our implementation?
   - Does v0.50.0 handle any of the error cases differently than previous versions?
   - Are there any breaking changes between v0.49.0 and v0.50.0 that we should be aware of?

4. **Recommended Implementation Pattern**:
   - Based on v0.50.0, what is the recommended minimal implementation for streaming with tool use?
   - Is there a specific pattern for tool validation during streaming in this version?
   - What error handling approaches are recommended specifically for v0.50.0?

## Specific Code Examples Needed

1. A minimal working example of streaming with tool use specifically for v0.50.0
2. Example of setting beta flags in the client for v0.50.0
3. Complete event handling code for tool use during streaming in v0.50.0
4. Error handling patterns recommended for v0.50.0

Please include any relevant links to the official SDK documentation, GitHub repository, or examples specifically for v0.50.0.

This information will help us ensure our implementation is optimized for the current SDK version and follows the recommended patterns.
