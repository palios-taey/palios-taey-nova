### Key Points
- Anthropic SDK v0.50.0 supports streaming with tool use, building on features introduced in earlier versions.
- Use `client.messages.stream()` for streaming, with beta flags set via `default_headers`.
- No breaking changes from v0.49.0 to v0.50.0 affect streaming or tool use.
- Event handling for tool use involves accumulating `input_json_delta` and validating at `content_block_stop`.
- Error handling should include try-except blocks and retry logic for robust integration.

### Overview
The Anthropic SDK v0.50.0 is well-suited for your needs, allowing real-time streaming with tool use for the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. It seems likely that this version includes all necessary features, with minor internal improvements over v0.49.0, ensuring compatibility with your Python 3.11.6 environment. Below, we provide clear guidance and code examples to help you implement a production-ready solution.

### Setting Up the SDK
To use streaming with tool use, initialize the `AsyncAnthropic` client with beta flags in the `default_headers`. This enables features like 128k output and tool use. The `client.messages.stream()` method is the recommended approach for streaming responses, handling events like text and tool inputs in real time.

### Handling Tools and Streaming
When Claude decides to use a tool, the API sends `content_block_delta` events with partial JSON inputs (`input_json_delta`). You can collect these and validate the complete input when a `content_block_stop` event is received, using a library like Pydantic to ensure correctness before execution.

### Error Handling
To make your integration robust, wrap streaming code in try-except blocks to catch network or API errors. The SDK may send error events (e.g., `overloaded_error` during high usage), which you can handle by implementing retry logic for transient issues.

### Code Example
Below is a minimal working example tailored for v0.50.0, showing how to stream responses, handle tool use, and manage errors.

```python
from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic
import json
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = AsyncAnthropic(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    default_headers={"anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19,tools-2024-05-16"}
)

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City and state, e.g., San Francisco, CA"},
                    "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]}
                },
                "required": ["location"]
            }
        }
    }
]

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston today?"}]

class WeatherInput(BaseModel):
    location: str
    unit: str

async def stream_with_tools():
    try:
        async with client.messages.stream(
            model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
            max_tokens=1024,
            messages=messages,
            tools=tools,
            tool_choice={"type": "any"},
            thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 500},
            cache_control={"type": "ephemeral"}
        ) as stream:
            tool_input = ""
            async for event in stream:
                if event.type == "content_block_delta" and event.delta.type == "input_json_delta":
                    tool_input += event.delta.partial_json
                elif event.type == "content_block_stop":
                    try:
                        full_tool_input = json.loads(tool_input)
                        WeatherInput(**full_tool_input)
                        print("Valid tool input:", full_tool_input)
                    except Exception as e:
                        print("Tool input validation failed:", e)
                elif event.type == "text":
                    print(event.text, end="", flush=True)
            final_message = await stream.get_final_message()
            print("Final message:", final_message)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Streaming error:", e)
        # Implement retry logic here if needed

### Comprehensive Report on Anthropic SDK v0.50.0 for Streaming with Tool Use

This report provides detailed answers to your questions about using Anthropic SDK v0.50.0 for streaming with tool use in your environment (Python 3.11.6, Claude 3.7 Sonnet model). It leverages the latest documentation and repository information to ensure a production-ready implementation.

#### SDK Version Compatibility
- **Suitability for Streaming with Tool Use**: The Anthropic SDK v0.50.0 is highly suitable for implementing streaming with tool use. Support for tool use in streaming was introduced in v0.26.0, with additions like the `tool_choice` parameter and streaming for `tool_use` blocks ([SDK Changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)). Subsequent versions, including v0.27.0, made tool use generally available and refactored streaming to an event iterator structure, enhancing reliability. Version 0.50.0 builds on these features, making it a robust choice.
- **Known Issues or Limitations**: No specific issues are reported for streaming with tool use in v0.50.0. The changelog notes an internal refactoring where ContentBlockDelta events were extracted into their own schemas ([Issue #920](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/issues/920)), but this does not impact user-facing functionality. General SDK warnings about non-streaming requests with large `max_tokens` values (potential timeouts) do not apply since you are using streaming ([Anthropic PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic/)).
- **Documentation Examples**: The SDK repository includes a streaming example in `messages_stream.py` ([Messages Stream Example](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/messages_stream.py)), which demonstrates asynchronous streaming but does not include tool use. However, the tool use documentation ([Tool Use](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use)) and streaming helpers ([Helpers](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/helpers.md)) provide guidance that applies to v0.50.0. You can adapt these by adding the `tools` parameter to the streaming call.

#### API Structure for v0.50.0
- **Streaming Method**: The recommended method for streaming is `client.messages.stream()`, which supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It returns a `MessageStreamManager`, allowing iteration over events and access to the final message ([Helpers](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/helpers.md)). This method is memory-efficient and designed for real-time applications like yours.
- **Beta Flags Configuration**: Beta flags are set using the `default_headers` parameter when initializing the client, as shown below:
  ```python
  from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic
  client = AsyncAnthropic(
      api_key="your_api_key",
      default_headers={"anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19,tools-2024-05-16"}
  )
  ```
  This approach has remained consistent across versions, including v0.50.0, and enables features like 128k output and tool use. No changes to this mechanism are noted in the changelog.
- **Event Structure**: The event structure for streaming in v0.50.0 aligns with previous versions, as outlined in the streaming documentation ([Streaming Messages](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming)). Key events include:
  | Event Type                | Description                                                                 |
  |---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `message_start`           | Initiates the message with an empty content array.                          |
  | `content_block_start`     | Marks the start of a content block (e.g., text or tool use).                |
  | `content_block_delta`     | Provides partial updates, including `input_json_delta` for tool inputs.     |
  | `content_block_stop`      | Signals the end of a content block, allowing full parsing of tool inputs.   |
  | `message_delta`           | Updates top-level message properties, e.g., `stop_reason`.                  |
  | `message_stop`            | Indicates the end of the stream.                                            |
  The internal refactoring of ContentBlockDelta events in v0.50.0 does not alter this structure, ensuring compatibility with your existing event-handling logic.

#### Version-Specific Features
- **New Features or Improvements**: The primary improvement in v0.50.0 is the extraction of ContentBlockDelta events into their own schemas, which enhances internal code organization but does not introduce new user-facing features ([SDK Changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)). Earlier versions added relevant features, such as support for disabling tool calls (v0..Concurrent tool use is not supported in Claude, so Claude will only select one tool at a time, even if multiple tools are provided.49.0) and streaming helpers for beta messages (v0.43.0), which are inherited by v0.50.0.
- **Error Handling Differences**: No specific changes to error handling are documented for v0.50.0. The SDK continues to support error detection through event streams (e.g., `overloaded_error` for HTTP 529 equivalents) and raises exceptions for network or API issues ([Streaming Messages](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming)). Your existing try-except approach remains valid.
- **Breaking Changes**: There are no breaking changes between v0.49.0 and v0.50.0 that affect streaming or tool use. The ContentBlockDelta refactoring is internal, and the public API remains unchanged, ensuring your code from v0.49.0 is compatible.

#### Recommended Implementation Pattern
- **Minimal Implementation**: The recommended approach uses `client.messages.stream()` with the `tools` parameter to enable streaming with tool use. You should:
  1. Initialize the client with beta flags.
  2. Define tools in the `tools` parameter, specifying their schema.
  3. Stream responses and handle events, particularly `content_block_delta` for tool inputs and `content_block_stop` for validation.
  4. Use Pydantic or similar for input validation before tool execution.
  A complete example is provided below in the code examples section.
- **Tool Validation Pattern**: Accumulate `input_json_delta` strings from `content_block_delta` events in a variable (e.g., `tool_input`). When a `content_block_stop` event is received, parse the accumulated string as JSON and validate it against the tool’s schema using Pydantic. This ensures the input is complete and correct before execution.
- **Error Handling Approaches**: Implement the following for robust error handling:
  - **Try-Except Blocks**: Wrap the streaming context to catch exceptions like network errors or API failures.
  - **Event-Based Error Handling**: Check for error events in the stream (e.g., `overloaded_error`) and handle them appropriately.
  - **Retry Logic**: For transient errors (e.g., HTTP 529), implement exponential backoff retries.
  - **Logging**: Enable SDK logging by setting the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_LOG=info` for debugging ([Anthropic PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic/)).

#### Specific Code Examples
1. **Minimal Working Example of Streaming with Tool Use**:
   ```python
   from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic
   import json
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   client = AsyncAnthropic(
       api_key="your_api_key",
       default_headers={"anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19,tools-2024-05-16"}
   )

   tools = [
       {
           "type": "function",
           "function": {
               "name": "get_current_weather",
               "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
               "parameters": {
                   "type": "object",
                   "properties": {
                       "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City and state, e.g., San Francisco, CA"},
                       "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]}
                   },
                   "required": ["location"]
               }
           }
       }
   ]

   messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston today?"}]

   class WeatherInput(BaseModel):
       location: str
       unit: str

   async def stream_with_tools():
       try:
           async with client.messages.stream(
               model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
               max_tokens=1024,
               messages=messages,
               tools=tools,
               tool_choice={"type": "any"},
               thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 500},
               cache_control={"type": "ephemeral"}
           ) as stream:
               tool_input = ""
               async for event in stream:
                   if event.type == "content_block_delta" and event.delta.type == "input_json_delta":
                       tool_input += event.delta.partial_json
                   elif event.type == "content_block_stop":
                       try:
                           full_tool_input = json.loads(tool_input)
                           WeatherInput(**full_tool_input)
                           print("Valid tool input:", full_tool_input)
                       except Exception as e:
                           print("Tool input validation failed:", e)
                   elif event.type == "text":
                       print(event.text, end="", flush=True)
               final_message = await stream.get_final_message()
               print("Final message:", final_message)
       except Exception as e:
           print("Streaming error:", e)
           # Implement retry logic here if needed
   ```

2. **Setting Beta Flags**:
   ```python
   from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic
   client = AsyncAnthropic(
       api_key="your_api_key",
       default_headers={"anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19,tools-2024-05-16"}
   )
   ```

3. **Complete Event Handling for Tool Use**:
   The event handling logic is included in the minimal example above. Specifically:
   - Accumulate `input_json_delta` from `content_block_delta` events:
     ```python
     if event.type == "content_block_delta" and event.delta.type == "input_json_delta":
         tool_input += event.delta.partial_json
     ```
   - Parse and validate at `content_block_stop`:
     ```python
     elif event.type == "content_block_stop":
         try:
             full_tool_input = json.loads(tool_input)
             WeatherInput(**full_tool_input)
             print("Valid tool input:", full_tool_input)
         except Exception as e:
             print("Tool input validation failed:", e)
     ```

4. **Error Handling Patterns**:
   ```python
   try:
       async with client.messages.stream(...) as stream:
           # Streaming and event handling logic
   except Exception as e:
       print("Streaming error:", e)
       # Example retry logic
       import time
       retries = 3
       for attempt in range(retries):
           try:
               async with client.messages.stream(...) as stream:
                   # Retry streaming
                   break
           except Exception as retry_error:
               if attempt < retries - 1:
                   time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
               else:
                   print("Max retries reached:", retry_error)
   ```

#### Additional Notes
- **Previous Issues**: Your earlier issues (e.g., `anthropic_beta` error) were due to incorrect parameter passing. Using `default_headers` resolves this, as confirmed for v0.50.0.
- **Environment Fit**: The SDK v0.50.0 is compatible with Python 3.11.6 and the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, ensuring seamless integration in your Docker-based setup.
- **Documentation Gaps**: While specific streaming-with-tool-use examples for v0.50.0 are limited, combining the streaming example (`messages_stream.py`) with tool use documentation provides a clear path forward.
