# Claude DC Implementation with Namespace Isolation

This is a clean, isolated implementation of Claude Computer Use tool integration with careful namespace isolation to avoid conflicts with production code.

## Key Features

- **Namespace Isolation**: All modules, classes, and functions use the `dc_` prefix to avoid conflicts
- **Registry Pattern**: Centralized tool registry for registration and access
- **Mock Implementations**: Safe mock implementations for development and testing
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Robust error handling with retry capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Isolated tests that won't affect production

## Directory Structure

```
/dc_impl/
  __init__.py
  dc_executor.py   - Main executor for tools
  dc_setup.py      - Initialization and setup
  
  /models/
    __init__.py
    dc_models.py   - Data models with unique names
    
  /registry/
    __init__.py
    dc_registry.py - Tool registry with registration functions
    
  /tools/
    __init__.py
    dc_adapters.py - Safe tool adapters with validation
    
  /tests/
    __init__.py
    test_tools.py  - Isolated tests for the implementation
```

## Safe Usage

All components are carefully namespace-isolated:

- Models: `DCToolResult` instead of `ToolResult`
- Functions: `dc_execute_tool` instead of `execute_tool`
- Registry: `DC_TOOL_REGISTRY` instead of `TOOL_REGISTRY`
- Tool names: `dc_computer` instead of `computer`

## Getting Started

1. Initialize the implementation:

```python
from claude_dc_implementation.computeruse.custom.dc_impl.dc_setup import dc_initialize

# Initialize the implementation
dc_initialize()
```

2. Execute tools safely:

```python
from claude_dc_implementation.computeruse.custom.dc_impl.dc_executor import dc_execute_tool

# Execute a tool
result = await dc_execute_tool(
    tool_name="dc_computer",
    tool_input={"action": "screenshot"}
)

# Access the result
if result.error:
    print(f"Error: {result.error}")
else:
    print(f"Output: {result.output}")
```

## Running Tests

Run the tests with:

```bash
cd /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m claude_dc_implementation.computeruse.custom.dc_impl.tests.test_tools
```

## Integration with Production

This implementation is designed to be completely isolated from production. When ready to integrate:

1. **Mock Testing First**: Test thoroughly with mock implementations
2. **Gradual Integration**: Integrate one tool at a time
3. **Extensive Logging**: Monitor all interactions during integration
4. **Fallback Ready**: Ensure fallback mechanisms are in place

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Complete the mock implementations with realistic behavior
2. Add integration tests for real-world scenarios
3. Create adapters for production tools with careful isolation
4. Implement advanced fallback strategies
5. Add more tools to the registry as needed
