# Mouse Operations Adapter Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive mouse operations adapter for the Computer Use (beta) feature. The adapter provides enhanced functionality for mouse movement, clicks, and drag operations with robust validation, rate limiting, coordinate validation, and error handling.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Mouse Operations

The adapter supports a complete set of mouse operations:

- **Mouse Movement**: Precise cursor positioning with coordinate validation
- **Mouse Clicks**: Left, right, middle, double, and triple clicks
- **Mouse Drag**: Drag and drop operations with start and end position validation
- **Position Verification**: Optional verification of final cursor position after operations

### 2. Enhanced Security and Validation

Multiple layers of validation and security features:

- **Coordinate Validation**: Ensures coordinates are within screen boundaries
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents too many operations in rapid succession
- **Parameter Validation**: Comprehensive checking of all input parameters
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Built-in performance monitoring capabilities:

- **Execution Time Measurement**: Tracks how long operations take
- **Success/Failure Logging**: Records operation outcomes
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks system resource usage

## Implementation Approach

The mouse operations adapter was implemented following the "YOUR Environment = YOUR Home = YOUR Responsibility" principle:

1. Created a detailed design document (`MOUSE_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md`)
2. Implemented validation functions for coordinates and parameters
3. Added rate limiting mechanisms for operation safety
4. Created core mouse operation functions with error handling
5. Developed unit tests for all components
6. Integrated with the enhanced bridge system
7. Created integration tests with other tools

## Usage Examples

### Mouse Movement

```python
# Simple mouse movement
await execute_computer_action("mouse_move", coordinates=[100, 200])

# Movement with position verification
await execute_computer_action("mouse_move", coordinates=[100, 200], verify_position=True)
```

### Mouse Clicks

```python
# Click at current position
await execute_computer_action("left_click")

# Click at specific coordinates
await execute_computer_action("left_click", coordinates=[100, 200])

# Right click
await execute_computer_action("right_click", coordinates=[300, 400])

# Double click
await execute_computer_action("double_click", coordinates=[500, 600])
```

### Mouse Drag

```python
# Drag operation
await execute_computer_action(
    "left_click_drag", 
    start_coordinate=[100, 200],
    coordinate=[300, 400]
)
```

## Key Components

### 1. Coordinate Validation

```python
async def dc_validate_coordinates(coordinates, screen_width=1024, screen_height=768):
    """Validate that coordinates are within screen boundaries."""
    # Check if coordinates are provided
    if coordinates is None:
        return False, "Missing coordinates", []
    
    # Check if coordinates are in the correct format
    if not isinstance(coordinates, (list, tuple)) or len(coordinates) != 2:
        return False, "Invalid coordinates format. Expected [x, y]", []
    
    # Check if coordinates are within screen boundaries
    # ...
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

```python
async def dc_check_rate_limit():
    """Check if the current operation exceeds rate limits."""
    global _last_operation_times
    
    current_time = time.time()
    
    # Add current operation time
    _last_operation_times.append(current_time)
    
    # Check if we have more than allowed operations in the time window
    # ...
```

### 3. Mouse Click Operation

```python
async def dc_mouse_click(computer_tool, action, tool_input):
    """Enhanced mouse click operation with validation."""
    # Check click interval
    if not await dc_check_click_interval():
        return DCToolResult(error="Click operations too frequent...")
    
    # If coordinates are provided, validate and move there first
    # ...
    
    # Execute the click operation
    if action == "left_click":
        result = await computer_tool.left_click()
    elif action == "right_click":
        result = await computer_tool.right_click()
    # ...
```

## Feature Toggle Integration

The mouse operations adapter can be enabled/disabled using the feature toggle system:

```python
# Enable/disable specific mouse operations
await set_bridge_toggle("use_mouse_movement", True)
await set_bridge_toggle("use_mouse_click", True)
await set_bridge_toggle("use_mouse_drag", True)

# Enable/disable rate limiting
await set_bridge_toggle("use_rate_limiting", True)

# Enable/disable position verification
await set_bridge_toggle("use_position_verification", True)
```

## Error Handling

The adapter provides detailed error messages for various scenarios:

- **Invalid Coordinates**: "X coordinate 1500 is out of bounds (0-1023)"
- **Rate Limiting**: "Rate limit exceeded for mouse operations. Please wait before trying again."
- **Click Interval**: "Click operations too frequent. Please wait before clicking again."
- **Missing Parameters**: "Missing start coordinates for drag operation"

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Coordinate validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Parameter validation
   - Individual operations

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Screenshot + Mouse Move + Click workflows
   - Bash Commands + Screenshot workflows
   - Mouse Drag + Click + Bash workflows

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the mouse operations adapter:

1. **Advanced Motion Patterns**: Curved movements, acceleration/deceleration
2. **Gesture Support**: Multi-finger gestures, swipes, pinch
3. **Element Recognition**: Auto-detection of UI elements from screenshots
4. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic adjustment based on system load
5. **Operation Recording**: Ability to record and play back sequences of operations
