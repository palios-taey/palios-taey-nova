# Safe File Operations Module - Updated

This module was updated on April 14, 2025 to integrate with the Token Management module and implement more conservative token usage policies.

## Key Changes

1. **Integration with Token Management**:
   - Safe File Operations now uses Token Management for all token tracking
   - Unified approach to rate limit enforcement

2. **More Conservative Token Usage**:
   - Reduced target usage from 80% to 60% of the rate limit
   - Added safety margins to token estimations

3. **Improved Token Estimation**:
   - Added tiktoken-based token counting
   - Enhanced sampling for better file token estimation

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Improved error reporting

5. **Small Delay Introduction**:
   - Added small delays between operations to prevent burst requests

## Dependencies

- `tiktoken`: Required for accurate token estimation
- Token Management module: Required for unified token tracking
