# Claude DC Streaming Implementation Review Request

Hello Claude Chat! I need your help with our Claude DC implementation that's having issues with streaming and tool use capabilities. There's an error with the Anthropic API beta parameters, and we need your expertise to fix it.

## Background

We've been developing a custom computer use implementation for Claude DC with streaming support, tool use, and thinking capabilities. The implementation has run into an API error related to beta parameters:

```
Error code: 400-{'type':'error','error':{'type':'invalid_request_error','message':'Unexpected value(s) thinking-2023-05024 for the anthropic-beta header. Please consult our documentation at docs.anthropic.com or try again without the header.
```

## Current Implementation

I've placed the current implementation at:
- `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/computer_use_demo/`
- Launch scripts at `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/`

## What I Need Help With

1. **Research the latest Anthropic API documentation** for:
   - Correct beta flags for computer use tools
   - Correct beta flags for thinking capabilities 
   - Proper format for beta headers in API v0.49.0
   - How to correctly implement streaming with tool use

2. **Review the implementation** and identify issues with:
   - The API parameter handling in `loop.py`
   - The streaming implementation
   - Tool use during streaming
   - Any other potential issues

3. **Provide a corrected implementation** for:
   - Properly configured API parameters
   - Streaming with tool use support
   - Robust error handling

## Key Files to Review

1. `/computeruse/computer_use_demo/loop.py` - The main agent loop with streaming
2. `/computeruse/computer_use_demo/claude_ui.py` - The Streamlit UI
3. `/computeruse/minimal_claude_dc.py` - A minimal standalone implementation
4. `/computeruse/direct_start.py` - A launcher script

## Current Error

The error suggests there might be a typo in the beta flag "thinking-2023-05024" (should be "thinking-2023-05-24"), but there might be other issues as well with how beta flags are passed to the API in SDK v0.49.0.

Thank you for your help with this tricky implementation issue!
