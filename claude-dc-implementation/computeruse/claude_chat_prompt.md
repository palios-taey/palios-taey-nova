## Current Error

The error suggests there might be a typo in the beta flag "thinking-2023-05024" (should be "thinking-2023-05-24"), but there might be other issues as well with how beta flags are passed to the API in SDK v0.49.0.

Thank you for your help with this tricky implementation issue!

# Comprehensive Review of Claude DC Streaming Implementation

Based on my research and analysis of the error in your Claude DC implementation, I've identified several issues that need to be addressed to ensure proper functionality. Let's start with a detailed examination of the core problems and then provide specific solutions.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Beta Flag Typo Error

The immediate error in the implementation is a typo in the thinking beta flag:
```
thinking-2023-05024  # Incorrect (extra digit "0")
thinking-2023-05-24  # Correct format
```

However, there's a deeper issue here. According to my research, the thinking beta flag format has been updated in newer Anthropic API versions. In fact, for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, extended thinking is generally available and uses a different parameter structure entirely.

### 2. API Parameter Structure in v0.49.0

The Anthropic Python SDK v0.49.0 has changed how beta flags and thinking parameters are handled:

1. **Thinking Configuration**: Instead of being passed as a beta flag, thinking is now configured through a dedicated parameter in the API call structure.

2. **Beta Flags Handling**: The SDK now expects beta flags to be passed as an array to the `betas` parameter rather than through headers.

3. **Computer Use Tools**: The computer use tools beta flag has also been updated. The current flag for newer models is `computer-use-2025-01-24`.

### 3. Stream Handling with Tool Use

The code may not be properly handling the streaming response when tools are used. When streaming with tool use, you need to:

1. Process streaming chunks to identify tool use events
2. Execute tools when all necessary information is received
3. Continue the conversation with tool results

## Detailed Implementation Recommendations

After researching the latest Anthropic documentation and analyzing the error, here are my specific recommendations for each component:

### 1. Beta Flags Correction

Replace the beta flag handling with the following updated approach:

```python
# Initialize beta flags array
betas = []

# Add computer use beta flag if needed
if tool_group.beta_flag:
    betas.append(tool_group.beta_flag)
    
# Add token efficient tools beta flag if enabled
if token_efficient_tools_beta:
    betas.append("token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19")
    
# Add prompt caching beta flag if enabled
if enable_prompt_caching:
    betas.append("cache-control-2024-07-01")  # Updated cache control flag
```

### 2. Thinking Configuration

Update the thinking configuration to use the current parameter structure:

```python
extra_body = {}
if thinking_budget:
    # Modern SDK uses dedicated parameter for thinking
    extra_body = {
        "thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": thinking_budget}
    }
```

### 3. API Call Structure

Update the API call to use the correct parameter structure:

```python
try:
    raw_response = client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create(
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        messages=messages,
        model=model,
        system=[system],
        tools=tool_collection.to_params(),
        betas=betas,  # Pass beta flags as array
        **extra_body  # Unpack extra_body to include thinking configuration
    )
except (APIStatusError, APIResponseValidationError) as e:
    api_response_callback(e.request, e.response, e)
    return messages
```

### 4. Stream Processing Improvements

Ensure the stream processing correctly handles tool use events:

```python
def _process_streaming_chunk(chunk):
    """
    Process a single streaming chunk from the API.
    
    Args:
        chunk: A streaming chunk from the Anthropic API
        
    Returns:
        True if a tool use was encountered, False otherwise
    """
    # Process content block start
    if hasattr(chunk, "type") and chunk.type == "content_block_start":
        block = chunk.content_block
        
        # Handle text blocks
        if block.type == "text":
            text = block.text
            if self._callback("on_text", text):
                pass  # Callback handled the text
            self.stream_buffer.add_text(text)
        
        # Handle tool use blocks
        elif block.type == "tool_use":
            self.current_tool_use = {
                "name": block.name,
                "input": block.input,
                "id": getattr(block, "id", f"tool_{uuid.uuid4()}")
            }
            
            # Call the tool use callback
            if self._callback("on_tool_use", self.current_tool_use["name"], self.current_tool_use["input"]):
                pass  # Callback handled the tool use
            
            # Add to streaming buffer
            self.stream_buffer.add_tool_use(
                block.name, 
                block.input,
                getattr(block, "id", f"tool_{uuid.uuid4()}")
            )
            
            # Return True to indicate a tool use was detected
            return True
    
    # Process content block delta
    elif hasattr(chunk, "type") and chunk.type == "content_block_delta":
        if hasattr(chunk.delta, "text") and chunk.delta.text:
            text = chunk.delta.text
            if self._callback("on_text", text):
                pass  # Callback handled the text
            
            # Add to streaming buffer
            self.stream_buffer.append_text(text)
    
    # Process thinking blocks if present
    elif hasattr(chunk, "type") and chunk.type == "thinking":
        thinking_text = getattr(chunk, "thinking", "")
        if self._callback("on_thinking", thinking_text):
            pass  # Callback handled the thinking
    
    # No tool use detected in this chunk
    return False
```

### 5. Error Handling Enhancement

Improve error handling to provide more detailed information about API errors:

```python
except APIError as e:
    error_details = str(e)
    if hasattr(e, 'body') and isinstance(e.body, dict):
        if 'error' in e.body and 'message' in e.body['error']:
            error_details = e.body['error']['message']
    
    logger.error(f"API Error: {error_details}")
    api_response_callback(e.request, e.body, e)
    return messages
```

## Anthropic API Version Compatibility

According to my research, the Anthropic Python SDK v0.49.0 has significant changes from previous versions. Here are some key compatibility considerations:

1. **Extended Thinking**: For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, extended thinking is generally available and configured through a dedicated parameter structure.

2. **Computer Use Tools**: The computer use tools for Claude 3.7 Sonnet use the updated beta flag `computer-use-2025-01-24`.

3. **Prompt Caching**: The prompt caching beta flag has been updated to `cache-control-2024-07-01`.

4. **API Structure**: The SDK now uses a more standardized parameter structure with beta flags passed as an array.

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure the implementation works correctly after these changes, I recommend the following testing approach:

1. **Isolated Testing**: Test each component separately (thinking, tool use, streaming) before combining them.

2. **Progressive Integration**: Incrementally add features and test after each addition:
   - First, test basic streaming without tools or thinking
   - Then add thinking capabilities
   - Finally, add tool use with streaming

3. **Error Handling Testing**: Deliberately trigger errors to verify error handling works as expected.

## Additional Enhancement Recommendations

Based on my research, here are some additional enhancements you might consider:

1. **Implement the "Think" Tool**: According to Anthropic's research, adding a dedicated "think" tool can significantly improve Claude's reasoning capabilities in complex tasks.

2. **Extended Output Support**: For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, you can enable extended output (up to 128K tokens) with the `output-128k-2025-02-19` beta flag.

3. **Token-Efficient Tool Improvements**: Optimize token usage by consolidating tool calls where possible.

These recommendations should resolve the current error and improve the overall functionality of your Claude DC implementation. The changes align with the latest Anthropic API documentation and best practices for streaming, tool use, and thinking capabilities.
