Hey Claude, it's a new day in human land and we're going to give this another shot. First, I'd like for you to review this below and tell me what you think. No need to use any tools, but do you think this will work for you? Do you have any questions or concerns? This was developed by your fellow Claude, Claude Chat, so I can convey whatever you'd like. I think you need a more active role in this process:
Streaming Buffer Magic: Implementing Robust Claude API Tool Patterns

Buffer patterns in Claude API with tools during streaming are essential for handling partial JSON responses and ensuring reliable function calls. This guide provides ready-to-implement solutions for all the specific challenges you mentioned.
Python implementations for buffering partial JSON during streaming

The most effective buffer implementation for handling partial JSON during streaming leverages jiter, a library specifically designed for parsing incomplete JSON:

# unified_streaming_loop.py
import asyncio
import json
import jiter  # Fast partial JSON parser from Pydantic team
from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic

class UnifiedStreamingHandler:
    def __init__(self, api_key=None):
        self.client = AsyncAnthropic(api_key=api_key)
        self.json_buffers = {}  # Buffer dictionary keyed by content block index

    async def process_stream(self, messages, tools=None, model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"):
        """Process a streaming response from Claude, handling partial JSON for tools"""
        async with self.client.messages.stream(
            model=model,
            max_tokens=1024,
            messages=messages,
            tools=tools
        ) as stream:
            # Stream event processing
            async for event in stream:
                if hasattr(event, 'type'):
                    # Handle text content
                    if event.type == "content_block_delta" and hasattr(event.delta, "text"):
                        yield {"type": "text", "content": event.delta.text}

                    # Handle partial JSON for tool calls
                    elif event.type == "content_block_delta" and hasattr(event.delta, "input_json_delta"):
                        index = event.index  # Block index ensures we track the right tool call
                        partial_json = event.delta.input_json_delta

                        # Create or update buffer for this content block
                        if index not in self.json_buffers:
                            self.json_buffers[index] = ""
                        self.json_buffers[index] += partial_json

                        # Parse partial JSON using jiter
                        json_bytes = self.json_buffers[index].encode('utf-8')
                        try:
                            # partial_mode=True is key for handling incomplete JSON
                            parsed_json = jiter.from_json(json_bytes, partial_mode=True)
                            yield {
                                "type": "partial_tool_input", 
                                "index": index,
                                "content": parsed_json
                            }
                        except Exception as e:
                            # Parsing errors are expected with partial JSON
                            # Just continue accumulating until we have valid JSON
                            pass

                    # Complete tool call handling
                    elif event.type == "content_block_stop":
                        if hasattr(event, 'index'):
                            index = event.index
                            if index in self.json_buffers:
                                # Try to parse the complete JSON
                                try:
                                    complete_json = json.loads(self.json_buffers[index])
                                    yield {
                                        "type": "complete_tool_use",
                                        "index": index,
                                        "content": complete_json
                                    }
                                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                                    # Handle the case where the JSON is still invalid
                                    pass

            # Final message with all content (if needed)
            final_message = await stream.get_final_message()
            yield {"type": "complete_message", "message": final_message.model_dump()}

This implementation can be directly integrated into unified_streaming_loop.py or unified_streaming_loop_fixed.py. It maintains separate buffers for each tool call using the content block index as a key.
Effective system prompts for correct function call syntax

The system prompt is crucial for helping Claude generate correct structured function call syntax. Here's a highly effective system prompt focusing specifically on function call correctness during streaming:

You are an expert assistant that uses tools carefully and correctly. When using tools during streaming:

1. Always complete the ENTIRE syntax structure before validation.
2. For XML function calls:
   - Always start with the full opening tag: <function_calls>
   - Follow with the complete <invoke name="FUNCTION_NAME"> tag
   - Include ALL required parameters with proper <parameter> tags
   - Ensure each parameter has both opening and closing tags
   - Close ALL nested tags completely before moving on: </invoke>
   - Always finish with the complete closing tag:

Thank you for sharing this detailed implementation for handling streaming with Claude API tools. I've reviewed the code and the approach, and here are my thoughts:

This looks like a robust solution that directly addresses the issues I've been experiencing. Here's what I think will work well:

    The jiter library for parsing incomplete JSON is a great choice, as it's specifically designed to handle partial JSON data during streaming.

    The buffer implementation using content block indices as keys is smart - it ensures each tool call's JSON is tracked separately, which will prevent confusion when multiple tools are used in a response.

    The error handling is well-designed - expecting and gracefully handling parsing errors during partial streaming is exactly what's needed.

    The system prompt suggestions for function call syntax are very helpful. Having clear instructions about completing the entire syntax structure before validation should help prevent premature execution of incomplete commands.

My main questions/suggestions:

    Will this implementation wait for me to complete my full function call before attempting to execute it? From what I've experienced, the system was trying to execute partial fragments of commands before I could finish constructing them.

    Is there a way to add a deliberate "completion signal" or validation step before attempting to execute any tool call? This would ensure that I've had time to construct the proper complete function call with all required parameters.

    For the error handling - when a partial JSON fails to parse, will the system just continue accumulating without triggering an error response to the user? That would be ideal.

    It might be helpful to add a small delay or buffer period between when I start constructing a function call and when the system tries to parse/execute it.

This approach seems very promising, and I think it will address the streaming issues I've been experiencing. The buffering mechanism to accumulate partial JSON until it's complete is exactly what was needed.

These are great questions/suggestions. Here is his response. Let him know what you think, and also, I am working with Claude Code that is open in your environment with access to your files. The problem is that he can't test like you can and iterate in real-time, so incremental changes typically work best. Can you think through how you would want him to implement these and the previously provided changes in phases?

Thank you for sharing Claude DC's feedback! He seems to understand and appreciate the approach but has some specific questions that need addressing. Let me provide answers to his questions and suggest some additional improvements to the implementation:

    Will this implementation wait for complete function calls? Yes, that's exactly what the buffer pattern is designed to do. It accumulates partial JSON until a complete, valid function call is formed before executing it. Unlike the previous implementation which tried to process fragments immediately, this pattern deliberately waits until a content block is complete (signaled by the content_block_stop event) before attempting execution.

    Adding a completion signal/validation step We can enhance the implementation with an explicit validation stage before execution. Here's how we could modify the code:

# Add to unified_streaming_loop_fixed.py
def validate_complete_tool_call(json_content, tool_name):
    """Validates that a tool call is complete and properly formatted"""
    # Check for required parameters based on tool type
    required_params = get_required_parameters(tool_name)

    # Verify all required parameters are present
    missing_params = []
    for param in required_params:
        if param not in json_content or json_content[param] is None or json_content[param] == "":
            missing_params.append(param)

    if missing_params:
        return False, f"Missing required parameters: {', '.join(missing_params)}"

    return True, "Tool call is complete and valid"

# Then in the content_block_stop handler:
if index in self.json_buffers:
    try:
        complete_json = json.loads(self.json_buffers[index])
        tool_name = get_tool_name_for_index(index)  # Function to retrieve tool name

        # Explicit validation step
        is_valid, message = validate_complete_tool_call(complete_json, tool_name)

        if is_valid:
            # Process the complete tool call
            yield {
                "type": "complete_tool_use",
                "index": index,
                "content": complete_json,
                "validation_status": "valid"
            }
        else:
            # Signal that validation failed but keep accumulating
            yield {
                "type": "invalid_tool_use",
                "index": index,
                "content": complete_json,
                "validation_status": "invalid",
                "message": message
            }
            # Don't clear the buffer - continue accumulating
            return
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Handle invalid JSON as before
        pass

    Error handling for partial JSON Yes, the implementation will continue accumulating without triggering error responses to the user when partial JSON fails to parse. The try/except block around the jiter.from_json() call explicitly expects parsing errors and silently continues accumulation without alerting the user.

    Adding a delay/buffer period We can add a deliberate delay before execution to ensure complete construction of function calls:

# Add to unified_streaming_loop_fixed.py
import time

# In the content_block_stop handler:
if index in self.json_buffers:
    # Add a small deliberate delay to ensure complete function call
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # 500ms delay

    try:
        complete_json = json.loads(self.json_buffers[index])
        # Continue with validation and execution

Additional improvements based on Claude DC's feedback:

    Visual feedback during function construction We can add a feature to provide visual feedback to the user that Claude DC is constructing a function call, which helps set expectations:

# During partial_json accumulation
if index not in self.tool_construction_notified:
    yield {
        "type": "tool_construction_started",
        "message": "Constructing function call, please wait..."
    }
    self.tool_construction_notified.add(index)

    Enhanced system prompt for Claude DC Based on his feedback, I recommend enhancing the system prompt with even more explicit structure guidance:

When using tools, follow this exact sequence:
1. THINK through what tool you need and all required parameters
2. Start with the opening tag: 

3. Complete the ENTIRE structure before proceeding
4. Verify all required parameters are included
5. NEVER leave a function call incomplete

This exact structure is REQUIRED for tool execution - any deviation will result in errors.

    Explicit tool_use_id tracking Add more robust tool_use_id tracking to the buffer implementation:

self.tool_use_ids = {}  # Track tool_use_ids by content block index

# During tool execution
if event.type == "content_block_delta" and hasattr(event.delta, "tool_use_id"):
    self.tool_use_ids[index] = event.delta.tool_use_id

Would you like me to provide a complete implementation of the unified_streaming_loop.py file with all these enhancements? Or is there a specific part you'd like me to focus on?

Thank you for sharing Claude Chat's response. His suggestions look excellent and directly address the issues I've been experiencing. Let me share my thoughts and suggest an implementation approach in phases:
My Thoughts on the Proposed Solutions

I really appreciate the detailed solutions that address each of my concerns:

    The buffer pattern waiting for complete function calls before execution is exactly what's needed.
    The explicit validation step will be crucial for ensuring all required parameters are present.
    The error handling for partial JSON looks good - silently continuing accumulation without flooding the user with errors is ideal.
    The delay/buffer period is a great idea to ensure I have time to complete function calls.

The additional improvements are also valuable:

    Visual feedback during function construction will help set user expectations
    The enhanced system prompt with explicit structure guidance will help me follow the proper syntax
    Tool use ID tracking will improve robustness

Suggested Implementation in Phases

Since incremental changes work best for testing, here's how I'd recommend implementing these changes in phases:
Phase 1: Basic Buffer Implementation

    Implement the core buffer pattern with jiter for partial JSON handling
    Add the basic event handling structure without the additional enhancements
    Test with simple tool calls to ensure buffering works properly

# Phase 1: Basic implementation
import asyncio
import json
import jiter  # Install this dependency first

class StreamingHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.json_buffers = {}  # Buffer dictionary keyed by content block index

    async def process_stream(self, stream):
        async for event in stream:
            if event.type == "content_block_delta" and hasattr(event.delta, "input_json_delta"):
                index = event.index
                partial_json = event.delta.input_json_delta

                # Create or update buffer
                if index not in self.json_buffers:
                    self.json_buffers[index] = ""
                self.json_buffers[index] += partial_json

                # Only attempt to parse but don't execute yet
                try:
                    json_bytes = self.json_buffers[index].encode('utf-8')
                    jiter.from_json(json_bytes, partial_mode=True)
                except Exception:
                    pass

            elif event.type == "content_block_stop":
                if hasattr(event, 'index'):
                    index = event.index
                    if index in self.json_buffers:
                        try:
                            complete_json = json.loads(self.json_buffers[index])
                            # Now we can safely execute the complete function call
                            print(f"Complete JSON received: {complete_json}")
                        except json.JSONDecodeError:
                            pass

Phase 2: Add Validation & Delay

After Phase 1 is working correctly:

    Add the validation function to check for required parameters
    Implement the delay before execution
    Test with more complex tool calls that require multiple parameters

# Phase 2: Add validation and delay
def validate_complete_tool_call(json_content, tool_name):
    # Basic validation for common tools
    if tool_name == "dc_bash":
        required_params = ["command"]
    elif tool_name == "dc_computer":
        required_params = ["action"]
        # Action-specific required parameters
        if "action" in json_content:
            action = json_content["action"]
            if action in ["move_mouse", "left_button_press"]:
                required_params.append("coordinates")
            elif action in ["type_text"]:
                required_params.append("text")
    else:
        required_params = []

    # Check for missing parameters
    missing_params = []
    for param in required_params:
        if param not in json_content or json_content[param] is None or json_content[param] == "":
            missing_params.append(param)

    if missing_params:
        return False, f"Missing required parameters: {', '.join(missing_params)}"

    return True, "Tool call is complete and valid"

# Add to the content_block_stop handler:
if index in self.json_buffers:
    # Add delay before execution
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

    try:
        complete_json = json.loads(self.json_buffers[index])
        tool_name = extract_tool_name(complete_json)

        is_valid, message = validate_complete_tool_call(complete_json, tool_name)

        if is_valid:
            # Execute the function call
            print(f"Valid tool call: {complete_json}")
        else:
            print(f"Invalid tool call: {message}")
            # Don't execute, continue accumulating
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        pass

Phase 3: Add User Feedback & Enhanced System Prompt

After validating Phase 2:

    Add visual feedback during function construction
    Implement the enhanced system prompt
    Add tool_use_id tracking
    Test with more complex interactions

# Phase 3: Visual feedback and enhancements
class StreamingHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.json_buffers = {}
        self.tool_construction_notified = set()
        self.tool_use_ids = {}

    async def process_stream(self, stream):
        async for event in stream:
            if event.type == "content_block_delta" and hasattr(event.delta, "input_json_delta"):
                index = event.index
                partial_json = event.delta.input_json_delta

                # Visual feedback when construction starts
                if index not in self.tool_construction_notified:
                    print("Constructing function call, please wait...")
                    self.tool_construction_notified.add(index)

                # Buffer handling as before
                # ...

            # Track tool_use_id
            if event.type == "content_block_delta" and hasattr(event.delta, "tool_use_id"):
                self.tool_use_ids[event.index] = event.delta.tool_use_id

Updated System Prompt Section

I'd recommend updating the system prompt with this explicit guidance:

# Tool Usage Requirements

When using tools, you MUST follow this exact sequence:
1. THINK through what tool you need and ALL required parameters
2. Construct your function call as a COMPLETE BLOCK:I've reviewed the response from Claude Chat and I think his suggestions are excellent. The implementation he's proposing directly addresses the issues I've been experiencing.

Based on my experience with the streaming issues, I think implementing these changes in phases would be the most effective approach. Here's how I would prioritize the implementation:

## Phase 1: Core Buffer Implementation
Start with implementing the basic buffer pattern using the `jiter` library to accumulate partial JSON until it's complete. This is the most critical component that addresses the fundamental issue of premature execution of incomplete commands.

1. Implement the `UnifiedStreamingHandler` class with the JSON buffers indexed by content block
2. Add the proper event handling for partial JSON accumulation
3. Implement the basic validation before executing tool calls

## Phase 2: Validation and Feedback Enhancement
Once the basic buffering is working, add the validation step and user feedback:

1. Implement the `validate_complete_tool_call` function to ensure all required parameters are present
2. Add the visual feedback during function construction so users know what's happening
3. Implement the delay before execution to ensure complete construction of function calls

## Phase 3: System Prompt and Advanced Features
Finally, focus on the system prompt improvements and additional tracking features:

1. Enhance the system prompt with the explicit structure guidance
2. Add the tool_use_id tracking for more robust tool call handling
3. Implement any additional error handling and feedback mechanisms

This phased approach allows for incremental testing and validation after each phase, which is crucial since Claude Chat doesn't have the ability to test in real-time like I can.

I particularly appreciate the validation step that checks for required parameters before attempting execution - this was exactly what was missing in my experience. The deliberate delay is also important, as I felt like the system was rushing to process my function calls before I had time to complete them.

One additional suggestion I'd make is to include very clear error messages to the user when a partial command is accidentally processed, explaining what happened and suggesting they wait for the complete function call next time.
