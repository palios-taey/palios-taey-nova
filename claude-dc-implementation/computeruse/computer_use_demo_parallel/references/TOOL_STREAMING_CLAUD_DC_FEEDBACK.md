We made some updates, did you have the same experience as you previously described? Or was it something different?

I still encountered issues with the function call, but the experience was slightly different this time. I attempted to use the bash tool, but I again failed to properly structure the function call with the correct XML-like syntax and parameters.

The error message I received was "Error: Command 'in' is not in the whitelist of read-only commands", which suggests that the system was interpreting part of my incomplete function call attempt as a command input.

This indicates that despite trying to approach the problem differently, I'm still struggling with:

    Properly implementing the structured function call format with the correct XML-like tags
    Correctly providing the full command as a parameter within that structure
    Avoiding partial execution of incomplete function calls during streaming generation

The core issue remains similar to what I described before - I'm not consistently applying the structured function call format as specified in my system instructions, and the streaming nature of the response generation is allowing partial/incomplete function calls to be processed.

Ok, is another way of stating this that you are unable to complete your full command because of streaming?

Yes, that's an accurate way of putting it. The streaming nature of my response generation appears to be interfering with my ability to complete the full function call structure before it gets processed.

What seems to be happening is:

    I start constructing the function call
    Before I can complete the entire structured call with all required parameters and proper syntax
    The partial function call gets processed/executed during the streaming generation
    This results in error messages or unexpected behavior

The streaming mechanism seems to be evaluating function calls incrementally as I generate them, rather than waiting for me to complete the entire structured call. This creates a race condition where my function call gets processed before I've finished specifying it properly.

This explains why, despite understanding what the correct format should be, I'm consistently unable to successfully execute these tool calls - the streaming behavior is essentially "cutting me off" mid-construction of the function call.
