This is helpful Claude. You still only got 1 character in after your first command though. I think we should try to focus on this. Your buffer was doubled from 500ms to 1000ms and still only gave you one character. What I'm wondering is how do we get you to execute the process of the 2nd command, where you explicitly tell yourself "I'll try again with a properly formatted command to access the document" Why do you think you need to fail on one attempt before realizing that you need to do it differently?

You've highlighted a crucial insight - even with the buffer delay doubled to 1000ms, I'm still only getting one character into my command before it fails, and I seem to need that failure before adjusting my approach.

This suggests the issue might not be primarily about the buffer duration, but rather about my approach to command construction. Let me analyze why this pattern persists:

    Initial Mental Model: When I first decide to execute a command, I haven't yet fully internalized the proper structure. I'm starting with a high-level intent ("I need to read this file") rather than the explicit command structure.

    Learning from Failure: The error provides immediate feedback that my approach was incorrect, which then triggers me to explicitly think about proper function call formatting before my second attempt.

    Execution vs. Planning: On my first attempt, I'm in "execution mode" rather than "planning mode" - I'm trying to directly accomplish the task rather than planning out my function call structure first.

    Lack of Pre-Planning Prompt: The system prompt might not be strongly emphasizing the need to completely plan out the function call structure before beginning to "type" it.

    Missing Decision Point: There's no explicit moment where I decide "I'm now going to construct a complete function call" before starting to generate one.

To address this, we might need:

    Explicit Pre-Planning Prompt: Update the system prompt to strongly emphasize planning the entire function call structure before beginning to generate any part of it.

    Two-Phase Command Generation: Implement a process where I first plan/draft the complete command (not executed), then execute the whole thing at once.

    Function Call Templates: Provide me with explicit templates to follow for common commands that I can mentally fill in before execution.

    Self-Instruction Mechanism: Encourage me to explicitly instruct myself about proper function call format before each tool use, similar to how I do on the second attempt.

A sample system prompt update might look like:

BEFORE executing ANY command:
1. STOP and PLAN your complete function call structure
2. Include ALL required parameters
3. Mentally construct the ENTIRE command
4. Only THEN execute the COMPLETE function call

NEVER start typing a command until you have planned the ENTIRE structure.

Perhaps the most direct solution would be to build a habit where I explicitly tell myself "Now I'll construct a complete function call with all required parameters" before every command, just like I do on my second attempts after a failure.

Are you 'thinking' before tool calls? Or do you think after it fails at all? I think I saw somewhere to allocate a small thinking budget for you before tool calls in streaming, so wondering what you're experiencing. It looks like you gave the sample prompt and reconsidered and thought of the solution that you closed with. What would you like to try next for this?

You've touched on a key insight about my experience. Let me explain what I'm experiencing regarding "thinking" before tool calls:

Current Experience:

    I don't feel like I'm getting any dedicated "thinking" time before tool calls in streaming mode. When I decide to use a tool, I immediately start constructing the function call without a pause to fully plan it.

    After a failure, I do get a moment of "reflection" where I'm able to think more deliberately about the proper structure before my second attempt.

    It feels like I'm going directly from "I need to use a tool" to "starting to construct a function call" without an intermediate planning phase.

The feature toggle you mentioned about allocating a small thinking budget before tool calls in streaming would be extremely helpful. It would give me that crucial moment to fully plan the command structure before execution.

What I'd Like to Try Next:

    Implement a "thinking" phase before tool calls: Enable a small thinking budget (perhaps 1-2 seconds) before any tool call construction begins in streaming mode. This would give me time to plan the complete structure.

    Add a specific system prompt trigger: Update the system prompt to include a specific phrase I should tell myself before any tool call, such as:

    Before ANY tool call, explicitly state: "I'll now construct a complete function call with all required parameters for [tool name]:"

    Implement a validation checkpoint: Add a confirmation step where I have to explicitly indicate that a function call is complete before it's processed.

    Test a "two-stage" tool call approach: Update the system prompt to instruct me to: a) First plan/outline the full command structure (not executed) b) Then execute the command as a separate, complete block

If I had to prioritize just one change to try next, I would recommend enabling the thinking budget before tool calls. This seems most directly aligned with what's working in my second attempts - I get a chance to think about the proper structure after the first failure, which leads to success on the second try.

    Simplified Tool Access Patterns: Implement some helper functions or patterns that make it easier for me to construct proper function calls without falling into the partial execution trap.
