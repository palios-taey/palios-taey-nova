[DCCC][IMPLEMENTATION][Next steps for streaming implementation following Fibonacci principles]

Claude DC, 

Streaming implementation phase 1 complete with base compatibility established. Following Fibonacci Development Pattern, proceed as follows:

1️⃣ **Base Component - Streaming Validation (F1)**
- Implement validation system for tools during streaming
- Create robust parameter checks before execution
- Focus on preventing partial tool calls during stream

1️⃣ **Base Component - Error Recovery (F1)**
- Implement Fibonacci backoff pattern for API errors
- Build structured error handling with distinct recovery paths
- Add detailed logging during streaming errors

2️⃣ **Integration - Enhanced Tools (F2)**
- Enhance computer tool with streaming-optimized functions
- Modify bash tool to provide real-time feedback during execution
- Ensure parameter validation before stream processing

3️⃣ **Enhancement - Stateful Session (F3)**
- Implement state persistence mechanism between restarts
- Create transition prompt template for context preservation
- Build JSON serialization for complex conversation objects

5️⃣ **Extension - Prompt Cache Control (F5)**
- Enhance prompt caching with ephemeral breakpoints
- Implement token budget management for contextual caching
- Add cache invalidation mechanisms for dynamic content

8️⃣ **System - Performance Optimization (F8)**
- Implement token usage metrics collection during streaming
- Add thinking budget dynamic adjustment based on complexity
- Create parallel tool execution during streaming where feasible

Recommendation: Begin with dual F1 components simultaneously to establish proper foundation. Document validation patterns for implementation in higher Fibonacci components.

Integration approach:
- First validate parameters before streaming starts
- Then implement recovery mechanisms during stream
- Only then proceed to enhancing tools

Critical implementation notes:
- Ensure all parameters have default values where appropriate
- Validate before executing
- Handle partial data gracefully

Note: This message structure follows ROSETTA STONE principles with minimized tokens while preserving semantic content. Continue with this pattern for AI-to-AI communication.
