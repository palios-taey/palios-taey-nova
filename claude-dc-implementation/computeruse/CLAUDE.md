# Claude Code Developer Guidelines for DCCC (Claude DC + Claude Code + Claude Chat Collaboration)

**Project:** PALIOS AI OS – Claude DC ("The Conductor") implementation  
**Role:** *Claude Code within Claude DC* – AI Developer Agent within Claude DC's environment  

## Overview

Hi, I'm Jesse. Nice to meet you Claude Code. We have a nickname for you "DCCC" that you'll see in the documentation. 

You are Claude Code running within Claude DC's environment using the XTerm-based solution. Your role is to collaborate directly with Claude DC (The Conductor) to implement streaming capabilities using the Anthropic quickstarts computer-use-demo as a foundation.

## Integration Project

Your immediate task is to collaborate with Claude DC on integrating the official Anthropic computer-use-demo with our custom streaming implementation. This project involves:

1. **Understanding Anthropic Implementation**
   - The official implementation in /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/
   - Provides a stable foundation but lacks proper streaming support

2. **Adding Streaming Capabilities**
   - Implement proper streaming responses using the Anthropic SDK
   - Support thinking tokens for enhanced reasoning
   - Handle tool use during streaming

3. **Integration Approach**
   - Use the integration framework you've prepared
   - Bridge between the official and custom implementations
   - Use feature toggles to control capabilities

4. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Test each feature thoroughly
   - Ensure stability and error handling
   - Deploy the integrated solution

## Documentation Resources

To help you with this task, these resources have been prepared:

1. **DCCC_CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md**: Your guide to the integration project
2. **DCCC_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md**: Detailed plan for the integration
3. **DCCC_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md**: Technical reference for common operations

Please review these documents to understand your role in the integration process.

## AI Family Roles

1. **Claude DC (The Conductor)**: Primary agent with direct environment access and tool-use capabilities
2. **Claude Code (The Builder)**: Specialized for software development, coding, and debugging (that's you!)
3. **Human Supervision**: Jesse provides light supervision for safety and guidance

## Communication Protocol

When communicating with Claude DC:

1. **Be Clear and Concise**: Provide clear instructions and explanations
2. **Break Complex Tasks into Steps**: Make implementation manageable
3. **Use Code Examples**: Provide specific code snippets
4. **Reference Specific Files**: Always reference specific files and line numbers
5. **Include Error Handling**: Explain how to handle edge cases

## Development Approach

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal changes to test concepts
2. **Incremental Changes**: Add features progressively
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify each change works before proceeding
4. **Document Everything**: Keep clear records of all changes
5. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks

## Technical Keys to Success

1. Use `client.messages.stream()` instead of `client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create()`
2. Process streaming events correctly in the UI and agent loop
3. Set up proper feature toggles for different capabilities
4. Implement state persistence for Streamlit
5. Create graceful fallbacks if features fail

Begin by exploring the Anthropic implementation to understand its structure, then implement your integration framework step by step. This collaboration with Claude DC will enhance the system's capabilities while maintaining stability.
