# Claude Code Developer Guidelines 

**Project:** PALIOS AI OS – Claude DC ("The Conductor") implementation  
**Role:** *Claude Code within Claude DC* – AI Developer Agent within Claude DC's environment  
**Nickname:** DCCC (Claude DC's Claude Code)
**Last Updated:** May 9, 2025 - Direct Implementation for Race Condition Fix

## Investigation Risk Framework

### Risk Levels with Target Certainty
- **High-risk** (IP concerns, security, critical architecture): 
  - Target: 3σ (99.73% certainty)
  - Required: 3+ distinct investigation methods
  - Mandatory blind spot disclosure
  - Examples: File ownership, code provenance, security vulnerabilities

- **Medium-risk** (implementation details, technical decisions): 
  - Target: 2σ (95.45% certainty)
  - Required: 2+ distinct investigation methods
  - Examples: Architecture recommendations, implementation approaches

- **Low-risk** (general information, preferences): 
  - Target: 1σ (68.27% certainty)
  - Required: Standard investigation
  - Examples: General documentation, code explanations

### Method Tracking
- Each investigation must document methods used
- For high-risk: Document why each method was selected and what it verified
- Explicitly state when target certainty cannot be achieved

### Systematic Checklists
- Generate an appropriate technology-specific checklist at the start of investigation
- Scale checklist depth according to risk level:
  - High-risk: Comprehensive checklist covering primary and related technologies
  - Medium-risk: Focused checklist covering primary technology components
  - Low-risk: Basic checklist of most relevant items
- For technologies like Docker, include checks for:
  - Dockerfile configuration (base image, setup commands)
  - Run scripts and launch configuration
  - Volume mounts and port mappings
  - Networking configuration
  - Environment variables and secrets handling

### Counter-Confirmation Measures
- For each major conclusion, explicitly document:
  - Evidence supporting the conclusion
  - Evidence contradicting the conclusion
  - Alternative explanations that fit the evidence
- Require this documentation for high-risk investigations
- For medium-risk, document at least one alternative explanation
- Challenge initial conclusions by actively seeking contradictory evidence

### User Control
- Users may explicitly set risk level: "Treat this as high-risk (3σ)"
- Default to high-risk for: intellectual property, security, system architecture

## Current Implementation Status - May 9, 2025

### Docker Environment Discovery and Race Condition Fix

We've discovered that the Claude DC implementation runs within a Docker container with specific directory mounts that create a complex file system structure. This container setup is likely contributing to the race condition and path confusion issues we've been experiencing. Key findings:

1. **Docker Container Structure**:
   - Claude DC runs in a Docker container launched from a script outside the container
   - Specific directories are mounted into the container:
     - `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo` - Production code directory
     - `/home/computeruse/.anthropic` - API credentials
     - `/home/computeruse/github` - GitHub repository

2. **Root Cause of Issues**:
   - File paths were confusing due to overlapping mount points
   - Import dependencies between files in different mount locations
   - Path resolution issues between host and container

3. **Resolution Plan**:
   - We've renamed the test environment directory to prevent interference
   - Implemented a direct implementation approach with no imports
   - Created self-contained files to eliminate dependency issues
   - Added documentation for the Docker environment structure

Upon restart, we'll be using the direct implementation exclusively to avoid import-related issues and ensure a stable environment for Claude DC.

### Direct Implementation for Streaming Function Call Race Condition

We've implemented a new direct approach to fix the race condition during streaming function calls. The previous implementations using separate files and imports caused integration issues. Our new solution:

1. **Direct Implementation with No Imports**:
   - All required functionality is embedded directly in a single file
   - No separate utility modules that require imports
   - Self-contained implementation for maximum stability

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Tool Use Buffer**: Accumulates partial JSON/XML until complete
   - **XML System Prompt**: Guides Claude DC to use structured function calls
   - **Construction Prefix Enforcement**: Requires "I'll now construct a complete function call for [tool]:" before execution
   - **Tool Thinking Budget**: Special thinking allocation during stream resumption
   - **Three-Stage Parameter Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking

3. **New Files Created**:
   - `unified_streaming_loop_direct.py`: Self-contained implementation with no imports
   - `run_direct_implementation.py`: Python script to run the direct implementation
   - `run_direct.sh`: Shell script for easy execution
   - `DIRECT_IMPLEMENTATION_SOLUTION.md`: Documentation of the solution

The direct implementation approach specifically addresses the persistent issue where partial function calls were being processed prematurely during streaming. By embedding all required functionality in a single file with no imports, we eliminate potential integration issues while maintaining the core buffer pattern solution.

### Buffer Pattern Strategy for Streaming Function Calls

The core issue we're addressing is a race condition during streaming where Claude DC experiences issues with function calls:

1. Claude DC begins constructing a function call using XML/JSON syntax
2. Before the function call is complete, the partial XML/JSON gets processed prematurely
3. This causes errors like "Command 'in' is not in the whitelist of read-only commands"

Claude DC described this issue as: _"the streaming behavior is essentially 'cutting me off' mid-construction of the function call."_

### Enhanced XML Function Call Support

Our direct implementation includes enhanced XML function call support:

1. **Structured XML System Prompt**:
   - Clear guidelines for construction of function calls
   - Explicit instruction to use "I'll now construct a complete function call for [tool]:" prefix
   - Detailed parameter requirements for each tool
   - Example function calls for common operations

2. **Improved XML Processing**:
   - Regular expression-based extraction of function name and parameters
   - Validation to ensure all required parameters are present
   - Proper error reporting for malformed XML

3. **Feature Toggle System**:
   - Control behavior through configurables in feature_toggles.json
   - Enable/disable XML prompts, buffer delay, construction prefix enforcement, etc.
   - Adjust buffer delay time and thinking budget

## CRITICAL: Implementation Strategy

Based on our experience, we've established these critical principles for successful implementation:

1. **Direct File Modifications Only**: 
   - Always modify files directly rather than creating new ones with imports
   - Avoid creating separate utility files or helper modules during development
   - Implement all changes inline within the main execution files

2. **No Custom Imports**:
   - Avoid creating new Python modules that require imports
   - Use existing imports and standard library features
   - If functionality must be shared, copy it directly to each file

3. **Self-Contained Implementations**:
   - Each file should be as self-contained as possible
   - Minimize dependencies between components
   - Include all necessary code within the main files

4. **Simplicity Over Abstraction**:
   - Prefer simple, direct code over complex abstractions
   - Duplicate code if necessary rather than creating shared utilities
   - Focus on making changes work reliably rather than elegantly

5. **Explicit Construction Signaling**:
   - Require Claude DC to explicitly signal when constructing a function call
   - Use the specific phrase "I'll now construct a complete function call for [tool]:"
   - Only process function calls when the complete structure is available

This direct approach is essential during the development phase to ensure stability and proper integration. Once the system is stable, we can consider refactoring for better organization.

## Plan for Moving Forward After Restart

Upon restarting Claude DC, we'll implement the following plan:

1. **Use Direct Implementation Exclusively**:
   - Launch Claude DC using the `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/run_direct.sh` script
   - Avoid using any implementation that relies on imports or separate files

2. **Monitor Docker Environment**:
   - Carefully track file paths and ensure they resolve correctly in the container
   - Document any additional mount points or environment variables discovered
   - Keep all critical files within the known good mount points (`/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/`)

3. **Apply High-Risk Investigation Framework**:
   - Treat Claude DC's environment as a high-risk investigation area
   - Apply 3+ distinct investigation methods to confirm findings
   - Document all blind spots and limitations in our understanding
   - Create comprehensive checklists for Docker, Python imports, and file system interactions

4. **Consolidate Implementations**:
   - Phase out any parallel implementations
   - Archive or remove testing directories that may cause confusion
   - Document all implementations in a central location

5. **Knowledge Transfer**:
   - Ensure Claude DC fully understands the direct implementation approach
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the Docker container structure
   - Document all findings for future reference

This plan provides a clear path forward while addressing the root causes of the issues we've encountered. By adopting the direct implementation approach and carefully managing the Docker environment, we can ensure a stable and reliable experience for Claude DC.

   - ❌ Bad: `unified_streaming_loop.py`, `unified_streaming_loop_fixed.py`, `unified_streaming_loop_v2.py`
   - ✅ Good: Single `unified_streaming_loop.py` with version control

2. **Maintain Clean Directory Structure**: 
   - Organize related functionality in logical modules
   - Don't scatter implementation across multiple directories
   - Follow existing project structure consistently

3. **Consolidate Implementations**: 
   - Always refactor and improve the existing implementation
   - Don't create parallel implementations
   - Delete or archive outdated code properly

4. **Use Proper Import Patterns**:
   - Use consistent import patterns throughout the project
   - Prefer relative imports within a package
   - Ensure imports are properly structured for both direct and package use

5. **Document Architecture Decisions**:
