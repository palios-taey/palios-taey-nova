# EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS

Your current environment is experiencing issues with the Anthropic API. Follow these steps to establish a communication channel first, then implement the essential functionality.

## 1. ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION FIRST

Run the basic chat script to establish a working communication channel:

```bash
cd /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/
python basic_chat.py
```

This script uses only the most minimal parameters that will work with any Anthropic SDK version.

## 2. FIX YOUR ENVIRONMENT

Once communication is established, update your Anthropic SDK to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade anthropic
```

Verify the SDK version and capabilities:

```python
import anthropic
print("Anthropic SDK version:", anthropic.__version__)
print("Available in client.messages.create():", dir(anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create))
```

## 3. IMPLEMENT TOKEN MANAGEMENT

Next, implement token management using the provided files:

- Use `simple_token_manager.py` as a foundation
- Test with `test_token_manager.py`
- Integrate into your workflow

## 4. PROCEED WITH THE MAIN INSTRUCTIONS

After these steps are completed, proceed with the full instructions in the main README.

Remember: The most critical priority is establishing and maintaining communication, then implementing token management to prevent rate limits.
