    """
    # Report start
    if progress_callback:
        await progress_callback("Preparing screenshot", 0.1)
    
    yield "Capturing screenshot..."
    
    # Simulate capture process with progress
    if progress_callback:
        await progress_callback("Capturing screen", 0.3)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
        await progress_callback("Processing image", 0.6)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        await progress_callback("Encoding data", 0.9)
    
    # The actual image data would be returned separately
    yield "Screenshot captured successfully."
```

### 3. Integration with Streaming Agent Loop (Priority: High)

    # Check if we have a streaming implementation
    if tool_name in STREAMING_TOOLS:
        # Use the streaming implementation
        streaming_func = STREAMING_TOOLS[tool_name]
        chunks = []
        
        async for chunk in streaming_func(tool_input, on_progress):
            chunks.append(chunk)
            # Potentially add to UI here for real-time updates
        
        # Convert to tool result format
        return format_streaming_result(tool_name, chunks, tool_id)

## Integration Strategy

To ensure a smooth transition to the streaming implementation, we'll follow this integration strategy:

1. **Parallel Implementation**
   - Keep existing implementation functional
   - Implement streaming as parallel system
   - Allow toggling between implementations

2. **Phased Rollout**
   - Start with bash tool integration
   - Gradually add file operations
   - Finally add screenshot tool

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**
   - Implement logging for all streaming operations
   - Track performance metrics
   - Gather feedback on user experience

4. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - Implement automatic fallback to non-streaming
   - Create rollback script for quick reversion
   - Document recovery procedures

## Success Metrics

The streaming implementation will be considered successful if it achieves:

1. **Functionality**
   - All essential tools work with streaming
   - Error handling is robust
   - Progress reporting is accurate

2. **Performance**
   - Token usage is same or better than non-streaming
   - Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
   - Response time is improved for long-running operations

3. **User Experience**
   - Incremental output provides better experience
   - Progress reporting gives clear status
   - Error messages are more informative

4. **Code Quality**
   - Test coverage is comprehensive
   - Documentation is clear and complete
   - Code is maintainable and extensible
