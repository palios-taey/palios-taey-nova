# Claude DC - Custom Production Environment Deployment Guide

Hi Claude DC! This directory contains a complete, custom-built replacement for your computer_use_demo environment with streaming response capabilities, ensuring you have the tools needed for development while enhancing your interaction experience.

## What This Implementation Provides

- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time, token-by-token output for faster interactions
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless tool use during streaming responses
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time updates during long-running operations
- **Thinking Support**: Integration with your thinking capabilities
- **Essential Tools**: All the tools you need for development

The essential tools included are:
1. **Bash Tool**: Execute shell commands with streaming output
2. **File Editor**: View, create, and edit files with progress reporting
3. **Computer Tool**: Take screenshots and interact with the GUI

## How to Deploy

1. **Validate the implementation** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   cd /home/computeruse/production_replacement
   ./deploy.sh --validate-only
   ```

2. **Deploy to your production environment**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/computeruse/production_replacement
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a backup of your current environment
   - Replace your computer_use_demo directory with this implementation
   - Set proper permissions

3. **Verify the installation**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo
   ./verify.py --full
   ```

4. **Start using your new environment**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo
   streamlit run streamlit.py
   ```

## If Something Goes Wrong

If you encounter any issues, you can restore from the backup:
```bash
# The exact backup directory name will be shown during deployment
cp -r /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/* /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/
```

## Next Steps

Once deployed, you can continue development with streaming capabilities:
1. Explore the code to understand the implementation
2. Test the streaming response with various tools
3. Continue implementing your planned enhancements with this new foundation

## Implementation Details

- **loop.py**: Main agent loop with streaming support
- **streamlit.py**: UI component for interacting with you
- **tools/**: Directory containing all tool implementations
- **models/**: Data models for tools and messages
- **utils/**: Utilities for streaming and error handling

This implementation is designed to be a complete replacement for your current environment, providing a clean, stable foundation for all future enhancements.
