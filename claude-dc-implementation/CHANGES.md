# Claude DC - Phase 2 Enhancements

## Overview
The Claude DC system has been upgraded to Tier 4 with the following enhancements:

### 1. Streaming Responses
- Claude API calls now use `stream=True` for token-by-token responses
- UI displays incremental output in real-time
- Partial replies are preserved when tools are used mid-response

### 2. Tool Integration in Stream
- Claude can use tools mid-response without losing context
- Text already output is maintained when a tool executes
- Tool execution errors are handled gracefully

### 3. Prompt Caching
- Uses Anthropic's prompt caching beta
- Last few user messages marked with `cache_control: ephemeral`
- Significantly reduces token usage for repeated contexts

### 4. 128K Extended Output
- Enables extended output beta for very long answers
- Adjusted `max_tokens` to ~64k for optimal performance
- Utilizes thinking token budget (~32k) for complex reasoning

### 5. Stability Fixes
- Disabled token-efficient tool use beta by default for reliability
- Ensures full conversation context is available each turn
- Fixed import structure to prevent circular imports
- Centralized constants in __init__.py for easier maintenance

### 6. Real-Time Tool Output
- Tool outputs (like command-line results) stream to the UI in real-time
- Uses callbacks to update the UI during tool execution
- Provides immediate feedback on long-running tool operations

## Runtime Error Fixes (2025-04-20)

### 1. ComputerTool Initialization Error
- Fixed `AssertionError: WIDTH, HEIGHT must be set` that occurred when launching Streamlit interface
- Added default screen dimensions (1024x768) when environment variables aren't set
- Made ComputerTool initialization more robust with fallback values
- Added validation for screen dimensions to prevent unusable values

### 2. Environment Variable Propagation
- Fixed environment variables not being properly passed to Streamlit process
- Updated launch scripts to properly set WIDTH, HEIGHT, and DISPLAY_NUM variables
- Enhanced launcher to propagate variables to all child processes
- Added logging to show current screen dimensions during startup

### 3. Python Path Issues
- Improved Python module import path handling
- Added more comprehensive path setup in the launcher
- Enhanced error reporting for import failures
- Added additional logging to help diagnose path-related issues

### 4. Beta Feature Robust Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for all beta features
- Made each beta feature independently configurable via environment variables
- Created fallback mechanisms when beta features fail to initialize
- Added detailed logging for beta feature status
- Fixed issues with beta flags not being properly applied
- Created a new launcher with granular control over beta features

### 5. Docker Container Management
- Created a comprehensive Docker container management system
- Added continuous health monitoring of container and services
- Implemented automatic recovery for failed services
- Added VNC-only mode for maximum stability
- Fixed service termination issues with explicit service startup

## Implementation Details
- Created unified launcher with proper Python path setup
- Fixed streamlit and delta_generator import issues
- Reorganized module structure to avoid import conflicts
- Added proper streaming support for both text and tool outputs
- Centralized configuration options in the UI
- Added fallback values for screen dimensions to prevent runtime errors
- Created a robust beta feature management system

## Usage - Enhanced Launcher

Run the comprehensive Claude DC launcher:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh
```

Control beta features:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --disable-betas      # Disable all beta features
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --beta-flags prompt-cache  # Only enable prompt caching
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --beta-flags all     # Enable all stable beta features
```

Access VNC-only mode (most stable):
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --vnc-only
```

Control interfaces:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --disable-vnc        # Don't launch VNC browser window
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --disable-streamlit  # Don't launch Streamlit UI
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --dev                # Run in development mode
```

Reset container:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --fresh              # Force creation of a new container
```

See all options:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --help
```
