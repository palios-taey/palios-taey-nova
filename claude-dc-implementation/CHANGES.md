# Claude DC - Phase 2 Enhancements

## Streaming Bash Tool Implementation (2025-04-24)

### Streaming-Compatible Bash Tool
- **Implemented**: Robust streaming bash tool with real-time output
- **Added**: Comprehensive security controls and validation
- **Enhanced**: Progress reporting during command execution
- **Integrated**: Connected with streaming agent loop for seamless operation

The streaming bash tool implementation provides:
1. Line-by-line streaming output for bash commands
2. Real-time display in the UI as output becomes available
3. Progress tracking with percentage updates
4. Comprehensive security validation with command whitelisting
5. Robust error handling for all error scenarios
6. Feature toggle integration for controlled deployment

```python
# Example usage:
async for chunk in dc_execute_bash_tool_streaming(tool_input, progress_callback):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

Implementation location: `/dc_impl/tools/dc_bash.py`

## Directory Structure Consolidation (2025-04-24)

### Custom Implementation Organization
- **Consolidated**: Organized custom implementation in computer_use_demo_custom/dc_impl
- **Centralized**: Moved all streaming components to the dc_impl directory
- **Integrated**: Connected development tools with production bridge system
- **Documented**: Updated documentation to reflect the new structure

The custom implementation approach uses:
1. Bridge pattern to avoid disrupting production files
2. Feature toggle system for controlled deployment
3. Namespace isolation with "dc_" prefix to prevent conflicts
4. Fallback mechanisms when features aren't available

Implementation note: Rather than replacing production files directly, we're building a parallel system that integrates through the bridge, providing safety and flexibility.

## Claude Code Integration (2025-04-21)

### Claude Code Terminal Fix
- **Fixed**: Encoding issues when running Claude Code in Claude DC environment
- **Added**: XTerm-based solution for running Claude Code properly
- **Improved**: AI-to-AI collaboration through reliable Claude Code integration
- **Documented**: Complete analysis and solution in CLAUDE_CODE_TERMINAL_FIX.md

The core issue was identified as terminal compatibility rather than just UTF-8 encoding. Claude Code uses advanced terminal features that aren't properly supported in the default terminal environment. The solution uses XTerm for proper terminal emulation:

```bash
xterm -fa "Monospace" -fs 12 -e "LANG=C.UTF-8 LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 /path/to/claude"
```

Added to quick setup script to automatically configure the Claude Code wrapper on setup.

## Overview
The Claude DC system has been upgraded to Tier 4 with the following enhancements:

### 1. Streaming Responses
- Claude API calls now use `stream=True` for token-by-token responses
- UI displays incremental output in real-time
- Partial replies are preserved when tools are used mid-response

### 2. Tool Integration in Stream
- Claude can use tools mid-response without losing context
- Text already output is maintained when a tool executes
- Tool execution errors are handled gracefully

### 3. Prompt Caching
- Uses Anthropic's prompt caching beta
- Last few user messages marked with `cache_control: ephemeral`
- Significantly reduces token usage for repeated contexts

### 4. 128K Extended Output
- Enables extended output beta for very long answers
- Adjusted `max_tokens` to ~64k for optimal performance
- Utilizes thinking token budget (~32k) for complex reasoning

### 5. Stability Fixes
- Disabled token-efficient tool use beta by default for reliability
- Ensures full conversation context is available each turn
- Fixed import structure to prevent circular imports
- Centralized constants in __init__.py for easier maintenance

### 6. Real-Time Tool Output
- Tool outputs (like command-line results) stream to the UI in real-time
- Uses callbacks to update the UI during tool execution
- Provides immediate feedback on long-running tool operations

## Runtime Error Fixes (2025-04-20)

### 1. ComputerTool Initialization Error
- Fixed `AssertionError: WIDTH, HEIGHT must be set` that occurred when launching Streamlit interface
- Added default screen dimensions (1024x768) when environment variables aren't set
- Made ComputerTool initialization more robust with fallback values
- Added validation for screen dimensions to prevent unusable values

### 2. Environment Variable Propagation
- Fixed environment variables not being properly passed to Streamlit process
- Updated launch scripts to properly set WIDTH, HEIGHT, and DISPLAY_NUM variables
- Enhanced launcher to propagate variables to all child processes
- Added logging to show current screen dimensions during startup

### 3. Python Path Issues
- Improved Python module import path handling
- Added more comprehensive path setup in the launcher
- Enhanced error reporting for import failures
- Added additional logging to help diagnose path-related issues

### 4. Beta Feature Robust Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for all beta features
- Made each beta feature independently configurable via environment variables
- Created fallback mechanisms when beta features fail to initialize
- Added detailed logging for beta feature status
- Fixed issues with beta flags not being properly applied
- Created a new launcher with granular control over beta features

### 5. Docker Container Management
- Created a comprehensive Docker container management system
- Added continuous health monitoring of container and services
- Implemented automatic recovery for failed services
- Added VNC-only mode for maximum stability
- Fixed service termination issues with explicit service startup

## Implementation Details
- Created unified launcher with proper Python path setup
- Fixed streamlit and delta_generator import issues
- Reorganized module structure to avoid import conflicts
- Added proper streaming support for both text and tool outputs
- Centralized configuration options in the UI
- Added fallback values for screen dimensions to prevent runtime errors
- Created a robust beta feature management system

## Usage - Enhanced Launcher

Run the comprehensive Claude DC launcher:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh
```

Control beta features:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --disable-betas      # Disable all beta features
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --beta-flags prompt-cache  # Only enable prompt caching
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --beta-flags all     # Enable all stable beta features
```

Access VNC-only mode (most stable):
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --vnc-only
```

Control interfaces:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --disable-vnc        # Don't launch VNC browser window
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --disable-streamlit  # Don't launch Streamlit UI
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --dev                # Run in development mode
```

Reset container:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --fresh              # Force creation of a new container
```

See all options:
```bash
./launch_claude_dc_complete.sh --help
```
