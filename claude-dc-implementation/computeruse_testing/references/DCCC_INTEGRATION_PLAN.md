# DCCC Integration Plan

This document outlines the integration plan for the Claude DC streaming implementation. It provides a structured approach for Claude DC and DCCC (Claude DC's Claude Code) to collaborate effectively.

## Integration Goals

1. Implement streaming capabilities for more responsive user experience
2. Add support for thinking tokens during streaming
3. Enable tool use within streaming responses
4. Maintain system stability and backward compatibility

## Integration Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

1. **Environment Understanding**
   - Review existing code in `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/`
   - Understand current limitations and requirements
   - Identify key integration points

2. **Integration Framework Setup**
   - Copy reference implementation from `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computer_use_demo_custom/`
   - Set up feature toggle system
   - Establish logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: Core Integration

1. **Basic Streaming Implementation**
   - Implement token-by-token streaming
   - Ensure proper event handling
   - Add error recovery mechanisms

2. **Tool Use During Streaming**
   - Enable tool execution during streaming
   - Implement tool output streaming
   - Add validation for tool parameters

3. **Thinking Token Integration**
   - Add support for thinking tokens
   - Implement thinking budget management
   - Display thinking output appropriately

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1. **Component Testing**
   - Test each component individually
   - Verify error handling works as expected
   - Check performance with various inputs

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test all components working together
   - Verify seamless transitions between components
   - Check for unexpected interactions

3. **User Experience Testing**
   - Test from a user perspective
   - Verify responsiveness and usability
   - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Phased Deployment**
   - Enable features gradually through feature toggles
   - Monitor for issues at each step
   - Roll back if problems arise

2. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation with changes
   - Document lessons learned
   - Create user guides as needed

3. **Maintenance Plan**
   - Establish monitoring and alerting
   - Set up backup and recovery procedures
   - Define update process

## Feature Toggle Strategy

The feature toggle system allows for controlled deployment of features:

```json
{
  "use_streaming_bash": true,
  "use_streaming_file": true,
  "use_streaming_screenshot": false,
  "use_unified_streaming": true,
  "use_streaming_thinking": true
}
```

By starting with a subset of features enabled, we can validate each component before enabling more complex functionality.

## Integration Rules

### For DCCC (Claude Code):

1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow existing code organization patterns
   - Use clear module and function names
   - Add comprehensive docstrings

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add try/except blocks for all external calls
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for failures
   - Log detailed error information

3. **Configuration**
   - NEVER modify default configuration values
   - DO NOT change image handling settings
   - Use feature toggles for new functionality

### For Claude DC:

1. **Testing Approach**
   - Test basic functionality first
   - Progressively test more complex features
   - Report issues with detailed context

2. **Deployment**
   - Create backups before deployment
   - Follow phased deployment approach
   - Monitor for issues after deployment

3. **Configuration**
   - Keep default configuration values
   - DO NOT modify image handling settings
   - Use provided feature toggle settings

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation is located in:

```
/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computer_use_demo_custom/
```

All paths in this document should be treated as absolute paths from the root of the filesystem.

Key files include:

1. **unified_streaming_loop.py** - Main agent loop
2. **streaming_enhancements.py** - Session management
3. **tools/dc_bash.py** - Streaming bash tool
4. **tools/dc_file.py** - Streaming file tool
5. **feature_toggles.json** - Feature toggle configuration

## Implementation Schedule

1. **Day 1**: Environment setup and foundation
2. **Day 2**: Core streaming implementation
3. **Day 3**: Tool integration and testing
4. **Day 4**: Thinking token integration and testing
5. **Day 5**: Final integration and deployment

This schedule allows for thorough testing at each stage while maintaining momentum.

## Success Criteria

The integration is considered successful when:

1. Responses stream token-by-token in real-time
2. Tools can be executed during streaming
3. Thinking tokens are properly displayed
4. All features can be toggled on/off
5. The system is stable and reliable
6. Error handling works correctly

By following this integration plan, Claude DC and DCCC can collaborate effectively to implement streaming capabilities while maintaining system stability.
