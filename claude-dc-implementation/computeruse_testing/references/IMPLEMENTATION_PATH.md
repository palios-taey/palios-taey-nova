# Implementation Path for Claude DC

This document provides clear guidance on the implementation path for the streaming integration project. It serves as a reference for Claude DC to avoid confusion about which implementation to use and how to proceed.

## Preferred Implementation

The preferred implementation is located in:

```
/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computer_use_demo_custom/
```

All paths in this document should be treated as absolute paths from the root of the filesystem.

This implementation includes:
- Robust streaming capabilities
- Tool use during streaming
- Feature toggles for controlled deployment
- Comprehensive error handling

## Key Files and Their Purposes

1. **unified_streaming_loop.py**
   - Main agent loop with streaming support
   - Handles tool execution during streaming
   - Manages thinking capabilities
   - Contains comprehensive error handling

2. **streaming_enhancements.py**
   - Enhanced streaming session management
   - Better handling of streaming interruptions
   - Improved thinking integration
   - Stream resumption capability

3. **tools/dc_bash.py** and **tools/dc_file.py**
   - Streaming-compatible tool implementations
   - Support for progress reporting during execution
   - Robust error handling

4. **feature_toggles.json**
   - Controls which features are enabled/disabled
   - Allows for gradual deployment of capabilities
   - Default toggle settings should be preserved

## Implementation Process

The implementation should follow this process:

1. **Environment Review**
   - Review the current environment and code
   - Understand the existing implementation structure

2. **Integration Setup**
   - Copy the implementation files to the appropriate locations
   - Preserve existing functionality through feature toggles

3. **Testing**
   - Test the implementation with default feature toggle settings
   - Test with and without streaming to ensure fallback capability
   - Check all tool functionality with streaming

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy with minimal changes to existing functionality
   - Enable features gradually through feature toggles
   - Maintain backward compatibility

## Critical Guidelines

1. **Configuration Preservation**
   - DO NOT modify image handling settings (keep default value of 3)
   - MAINTAIN existing token limits and other parameters
   - PRESERVE security settings and access controls

2. **Error Handling**
   - IMPLEMENT comprehensive error handling for all operations
   - ENSURE graceful degradation when features fail
   - PROVIDE clear error messages for troubleshooting

3. **Testing Approach**
   - START with minimal changes and test thoroughly
   - TEST each component individually before integration
   - VERIFY all features with realistic usage scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - DOCUMENT all changes made during implementation
   - UPDATE implementation status in documentation
   - RECORD any issues encountered for future reference

By following this implementation path, Claude DC can effectively integrate the streaming capabilities while maintaining system stability and avoiding common pitfalls.

## Default Feature Toggle Settings

The following feature toggle settings are recommended for initial deployment:

```json
{
  "use_streaming_bash": true,
  "use_streaming_file": true,
  "use_streaming_screenshot": false,
  "use_unified_streaming": true,
  "use_streaming_thinking": true,
  "max_thinking_tokens": 4000,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

These settings enable core streaming functionality while disabling potentially unstable features (like streaming screenshots).

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur during implementation:

1. Check the logs at `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_custom/logs/`
2. Disable features one by one to isolate the problem
3. Verify API parameters are correctly set
4. Ensure all required files are in the correct locations

By following this implementation path, Claude DC can successfully integrate the streaming capabilities while maintaining system stability.
