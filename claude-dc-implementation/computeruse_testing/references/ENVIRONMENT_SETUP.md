# Claude DC Environment Setup

## Completed Setup for Development Environment

We have successfully set up the development environment for Claude DC in this repository. The setup consists of the following components:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Created `run_dev_container.sh` script that starts a Docker container with Claude DC code mounted from the repository
   - Modified `loop.py` to support `dev` vs `live` modes via environment variable or command line argument
   - Added logging configuration to provide better visibility into what's happening
   - Set up environment-specific paths for backups and logs
   - Configured default token and thinking budget settings aligned with the Tier 4 requirements

2. **Deployment Script**:
   - Created `deploy_to_production.sh` that safely deploys changes from development to production
   - Includes automatic backup of the current production environment before deployment
   - Handles restarting the Claude DC container with updated code

3. **Backup Functionality**:
   - Added `backup_current_env.sh` script for creating timestamped backups of the Claude DC environment
   - Ensured separate backup directories for development and production environments

4. **Enhanced Claude DC**:
   - Updated the code to enable 128K token output capability for Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - Added prompt caching support for better token efficiency
   - Disabled token-efficient tools beta by default for stability
   - Set up appropriate logging for beta features and environment modes

## Current Code Structure

The code is structured with clear separation of development and production environments:

```
/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/
├── README.md                # High-level documentation
├── ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md     # This document
├── backup_current_env.sh    # Script to create backups
├── deploy_to_production.sh  # Script to deploy to production
├── run_dev_container.sh     # Script to run dev environment
└── computer_use_demo/       # Main Claude DC code
    ├── loop.py              # Agent loop with streaming
    ├── streamlit.py         # UI application
    └── tools/               # Tool implementations
```

## Next Steps

Now that the development environment is set up, we can proceed with the Tier 4 enhancements:

1. **Streaming Implementation**:
   - The code already has basic streaming support
   - Need to enhance the streaming to ensure partial replies persist through tool calls
   - Make sure streaming works reliably with all tools

2. **Tool Integration**:
   - Implement real-time tool output streaming for long-running tools
   - Ensure tool calls work properly mid-stream
   - Improve error handling for tool usage during streaming

3. **Testing Process**:
   - Run the dev container using `./run_dev_container.sh`
   - Test the streaming and tool integration
   - Verify that 128K extended output and prompt caching work as expected
   - Ensure environment-specific paths work correctly

4. **Deployment Process**:
   - Once all tests pass in the development environment, use `./deploy_to_production.sh` to deploy to production
   - Verify the production environment works as expected

By following this approach, we can safely develop and test the Claude DC enhancements before deploying them to the production environment, minimizing the risk of disruption to the live system.
