# Streaming Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement streaming capabilities in Claude DC to enhance responsiveness and user experience. The streaming implementation enables real-time token-by-token responses, tool execution during streaming, and thinking token integration.

## Architecture

The streaming implementation uses a layered architecture:

1. **Feature Toggles Layer**: Controls which streaming features are enabled
2. **Integration Layer**: Bridges between original implementation and streaming
3. **Core Streaming Layer**: Handles the actual streaming functionality
4. **Tool Adaptation Layer**: Makes tools compatible with streaming
5. **Error Handling Layer**: Provides robust error recovery and fallbacks

## Key Components

### Unified Streaming Loop (`unified_streaming_loop.py`)

The central component that manages the streaming session with Claude. It handles:
- Token-by-token streaming of responses
- Processing and displaying content blocks
- Managing tool execution during streaming
- Thinking token integration and processing

### Streaming Enhancements (`streaming_enhancements.py`)

Provides enhanced session management:
- Handling streaming interruptions
- Resuming from the correct point
- Stream state tracking
- Buffer management for message components

### Tool Adapter (`tool_adapter.py`)

Bridges between existing tools and streaming-compatible versions:
- Parameter validation and mapping
- Input normalization
- Progress tracking during tool execution

### Streaming-compatible Tools

Modified versions of standard tools that work with streaming:
- `dc_bash.py`: Streaming-compatible bash commands
- `dc_file.py`: Streaming-compatible file operations

### Feature Toggles (`feature_toggles.json`)

Controls which streaming features are enabled or disabled:
- `use_streaming_bash`: Enable streaming for bash tool
- `use_streaming_file`: Enable streaming for file tool
- `use_streaming_screenshot`: Enable streaming for screenshot tool
- `use_unified_streaming`: Enable the unified streaming loop
- `use_streaming_thinking`: Enable thinking token streaming
- `max_thinking_tokens`: Set maximum thinking budget

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Setup and Testing

1. Run `verify_setup.py` to ensure environment is properly configured
2. Run `backup_production.py` to create backups of all production files
3. Test the streaming implementation with `non_interactive_test.py`

### Phase 2: Integration

1. Integrate the streaming implementation with Streamlit UI
2. First, update all files EXCEPT `loop.py` and `streamlit.py`
3. Have DCCC handle the final deployment of `loop.py` and `streamlit.py`

### Phase 3: Deployment

1. Deploy with most features disabled initially
2. Gradually enable features through the toggle system
3. Monitor for any issues after each feature activation

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- Exponential backoff for retrying failed requests
- Graceful degradation when streaming fails
- Fallback to non-streaming implementation
- Detailed error logging and diagnostics

## Configuration Guidelines

1. **DO NOT** modify image handling settings (keep default value of 3)
2. Start with minimal thinking tokens budget (4000) and adjust based on performance
3. Initially disable screenshot streaming to maintain stability
4. Keep unified streaming enabled for core functionality

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur during implementation:
1. Check logs in `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/streaming/logs/`
2. Disable features one by one to isolate the problem
3. Ensure API parameters are correctly set
4. Verify all files are in the correct locations
5. Restart the server if connection issues persist

## Testing Guidelines

When testing the streaming implementation:
1. Test basic streaming first without tools
2. Then test simple tool execution during streaming
3. Test more complex tool chains
4. Finally, test thinking tokens integration
5. Always compare with non-streaming behavior to ensure functionality is preserved
