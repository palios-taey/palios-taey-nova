# Implementing Full Streaming and Tier-4 Enhancements in PALIOS Claude DC

## Overview and Objectives
In this phase of the **PALIOS AI OS** build, we will enhance the **Claude DC** “Conductor” agent with full streaming capabilities and **Tier 4** environment features. We’ll also establish an autonomous development workflow using **Claude Code** (Anthropic’s agentic coding assistant) to implement and test these changes with minimal human intervention. The key objectives are:

- **Full Streaming in Claude DC:** Enable token-by-token streaming of responses (including *“thinking” notes*) and ensure partial assistant replies persist even when tool calls occur mid-response. Integrate tool usage into the streaming loop with proper recovery/retry so no content disappears or gets malformed.
- **Tier 4 Enhancements:** Activate advanced features in the Claude environment, including prompt caching for efficiency, extended 128k-token output support, disabling the experimental “token-efficient tools” mode (to maximize stability), and real-time streaming of tool outputs to the UI.
- **Autonomous Build/Deploy Workflow:** Configure Claude Code as an autonomous coder/debugger that can modify the Claude DC codebase, launch a test Claude DC container (sandbox) to validate changes, and then deploy updates to the live environment – all **without human code review**. This includes providing strategy/guardrail context (`CLAUDE.md`), Docker scripts for a dev container, environment toggles for test vs. production, and specialized prompts so Claude Code can safely take over the development cycle.

By the end, Claude DC will stream responses reliably with large-context support, and Claude Code will be orchestrated to implement future upgrades **fully autonomously**. Below, we break down the implementation plan, required code/script changes, and prompt designs for this workflow.

## Setting Up the Development Environment (Dev vs Live)
To enable safe autonomous development, we use a **separate Docker container** for testing Claude DC changes. The live Claude DC container will remain running and untouched during development. Our project structure is as follows:

- **Live container code** (current production): `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/` (mounted in the running Claude DC Docker container).
- **Dev code repository** (GitHub clone for staging): `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/computer_use_demo/`

We will launch a **dev Claude DC container** that mounts the repository code, so Claude Code can edit files on the host and see them reflected in the dev container immediately. Streamlit’s auto-reload will pick up code changes in the dev container for quick iteration ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo#:~:text=Quickstart%3A%20running%20the%20Docker%20container)) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo#:~:text=match%20at%20L498%20you%20can,already%20configured%20with%20auto%20reloading)). 

**Docker Run Script for Dev Container:** Create a script (e.g., `run_dev_container.sh`) to run the Claude DC Docker image with the GitHub folder mounted and using alternate ports (to avoid conflict with the live container):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Launch Claude DC dev container with test code and unique ports
docker run -d --name claude_dc_dev \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \  # pass API key (and any needed env vars)
  -e CLAUDE_ENV=dev \                        # indicate dev mode inside container
  -p 8502:8501 -p 6081:6080 -p 5901:5900 \    # remap ports for Streamlit, noVNC, VNC
  -v /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/computer_use_demo/:/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/ \
  anthropic-computer-use:latest
```

This command runs a new container named `claude_dc_dev` using the **Anthropic Claude Computer Use** image (replace with the actual image name/tag if different). We map the host project folder into the container’s `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/` (overriding the built-in code) so that **Claude Code’s edits on the host are reflected inside the container**. Ports are mapped to avoid clashing with the live instance (e.g., dev Streamlit UI on `localhost:8502`, dev desktop at `localhost:6081/vnc.html`, etc.). The `CLAUDE_ENV=dev` environment variable is passed to distinguish this container’s mode.

> **Note:** Ensure the *Anthropic API key* is provided to the dev container (here we forward `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). You can reuse the same key as production, but keep in mind both containers will then share rate limits.

**Environment Mode Toggle:** Inside the Claude DC code (Streamlit app/agent loop), we implement a mode toggle so that the agent knows whether it’s running in **dev** or **live** mode. This can be done by reading an env var or CLI flag:
```python
import os, argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--mode', choices=['dev','live'], default=os.getenv('CLAUDE_ENV', 'live'))
args = parser.parse_args()
MODE = args.mode
```
Now the code can branch on `MODE`. For example:
- In **dev mode**, use verbose logging or debugging features, and perhaps use test API keys or lower concurrency. In production, use more conservative settings.
- Use separate file paths for backups/logs. e.g.: 
  ```python
  backup_dir = "/home/computeruse/dev_backups/" if MODE=="dev" else "/home/computeruse/my_stable_backup_complete/"
  ```
  So that when Claude Code triggers a backup in dev, it doesn’t overwrite the production backup. (We will have the agent create a full backup of the *live* stable environment before deploying, as per best practices.)

At minimum, the `CLAUDE_ENV` toggle ensures any potentially destructive actions (like deploying changes or modifying external resources) are gated. In our case, **Claude Code will only deploy to production when explicitly instructed**, but having the code be aware of mode adds safety.

**Claude Code Configuration:** Anthropic’s **Claude Code** (beta) runs in the terminal and can edit files, run tests/commands, etc., with your approval. To allow it to operate autonomously in our workflow, we configure it as follows:

- **Install Claude Code CLI:** Ensure Claude Code is installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) and that you can invoke it with the `claude` or `claude-code` command ([Claude Code overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview#:~:text=Install%20NodeJS%2018%2B%2C%20then%20run%3A)). Log in or set up your API key for it (e.g., via environment variable or config).
- **Project context:** Run Claude Code from the project root (the GitHub folder) so it indexes the Claude DC codebase. For example:
  ```bash
  cd /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/computeruse/computer_use_demo/
  claude-code
  ```
  This will start an interactive session with Claude Code aware of the files in this directory. It “understands your codebase” and can retrieve or modify files as instructed ([Claude Code overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview#:~:text=Claude%20Code%20is%20an%20agentic,additional%20servers%20or%20complex%20setup)).
- **Permissioning for Autonomy:** By default, Claude Code may prompt for confirmation before executing potentially risky operations (like running shell commands or tests). Since we want it to proceed without human prompts, we can adjust its settings:
  - Use the **allow-list** for specific commands: Claude Code has a config for `allowedTools`. We can pre-approve the commands it will need. For example:
    ```bash
    # Inside Claude Code's CLI or config:
    claude config add allowedTools "Bash(docker run*)"
    claude config add allowedTools "Bash(docker logs*)"
    claude config add allowedTools "Bash(docker cp*)"
    claude config add allowedTools "Bash(docker stop*)"
    claude config add allowedTools "Bash(docker rm*)"
    ```
    The above would allow running Docker commands (to start the dev container, check logs, and deploy changes) without confirmation. We might also allow `Bash(python*)` or `Bash(pytest*)` if we have test scripts, etc., and any other necessary tools. 
  - Alternatively, run Claude Code with the **“no-confirmation” flag**. Claude Code supports a `--dangerously-skip-permissions` option to bypass all permission prompts ([Claude Code overview - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview#:~:text=you%20to%20run%20%60claude%20,can%20customize%20for%20your%20needs)). For unattended operation, one could launch it as:
    ```bash
    claude-code --dangerously-skip-permissions
    ``` 
    This is convenient, but less granular. It should be used only when you trust the agent’s guardrails, since it will execute any code changes or shell commands it deems necessary. Given our guardrails (safe environment and specific task focus), this is acceptable for our case.
- **Claude Code Guardrails:** Even with skipped confirmations, Claude Code won’t violate Anthropic’s safety policies. It also respects system safe-guards (for instance, our Claude DC has a Safe File Ops module that will prevent truly dangerous file system changes). We will further give Claude Code a strategy file (`CLAUDE.md`) with **clear guardrails** on what it should or shouldn’t do (detailed in a later section).

With the dev environment ready and Claude Code configured, we can confidently let Claude Code modify and test Claude DC’s code in isolation. 

## Implementing Full Streaming in Claude DC
By default, earlier versions of the Claude Computer Use demo did **not stream** tokens (they waited for completion) to avoid some issues. In fact, the reference code had `stream=False` in the agent loop, meaning long answers would only appear after the model finished, risking timeouts ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20Reference%20Implementation%20,appear%20after%20completion%20and%20likely)). We will reverse that and properly implement **stream=True** so that Claude DC’s responses appear incrementally. This involves changes at both the API call level and the UI update logic:

- **Enable SSE Streaming via Anthropic API:** Claude’s API supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming. Instead of a single completion, the model’s output comes as a sequence of events while tokens are generated. We set the API call parameter `stream=True`. For example, using the Anthropic Python SDK:
  ```python
  client = Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)
  response_stream = client.messages.create(
      model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
      messages=messages,
      max_tokens=10240,
      stream=True   # enable incremental streaming
  )
  for event in response_stream:
      if event.type == "content_block_delta":
          # got a chunk of text
          partial_text = event.delta.text
          output_callback(partial_text)  # display the token(s) to UI
      elif event.type == "message_stop":
          break  # end of response
  ```
  This sketch illustrates handling `content_block_delta` events which carry pieces of text. As Claude DC generates tokens, we immediately print or send them to the interface (e.g. using `streamlit` placeholders). The Anthropic SDK handles the SSE connection internally, so as long as we loop over the events, we’ll get a “live typing” effect without manual SSE parsing.

- **Streamlit UI Updates:** In the Streamlit app that powers the Claude DC web UI, we must update the display incrementally. Streamlit supports this via placeholders or an `st.empty()` container that we fill in a loop. For instance, we can create a placeholder for the assistant’s message, then update it as new tokens arrive:
  ```python
  import streamlit as st
  message_placeholder = st.empty()
  streamed_content = ""  # buffer for the assistant's message
  for event in response_stream:
      if event.type == "content_block_delta":
          streamed_content += event.delta.text
          message_placeholder.markdown(streamed_content)  # update partial text
      elif event.type == "message_stop":
          break
  ```
  This way, the UI text is updated token-by-token (or in small chunks). An open-source Streamlit chatbot example uses a similar approach of buffering streamed text and updating a markdown element on each chunk.

- **Persisting Partial Replies Through Tool Calls:** A major challenge is that Claude DC can invoke tools mid-response (the “agent loop”). When the model decides to use a tool, it yields a special `tool_use` block instead of continuing the user-facing text. We need to ensure that any text the model *has already output* remains visible while the tool is running, and that the final answer continues from that text. To handle this:
  1. **Detect tool invocation quickly:** With streaming, we may know sooner that Claude wants to call a tool. In Anthropic’s structured output, an event with `type == "tool_use"` will indicate the model’s decision to use a tool (and include which tool and input). The streaming loop should watch for this event. If detected, break out of the loop *immediately after outputting any preceding text*. (Anthropic’s API will also set a `stop_reason: tool_use` in the final response object ([Computer use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use#:~:text=,signaling%20Claude%E2%80%99s%20intent)), but catching it via streaming events is faster.)
  2. **Do not erase the partial text:** By the time a tool call is decided, the model likely produced some explanatory text like “Sure, let me calculate that for you…” which the user has seen. **Keep that UI content intact.** In our implementation, we won’t clear `message_placeholder` when the tool call happens. We simply stop appending more for now.
  3. **Execute the tool and get results:** As before, our agent loop will run the requested tool (e.g., Python code, web action, etc.) via `tool_collection.run()`. We may show a small indication in the UI that a tool is running (e.g., a spinner or a log message like “*(Claude is using **{ToolName}**...)*”). This is optional but improves transparency.
  4. **Resume the assistant’s response:** Once the tool result is obtained, we insert it into the conversation and call Claude again to continue the answer. **Critically**, when Claude continues, its next message will likely start where it left off. We append the new streamed tokens to the *same message placeholder*, so the user sees a seamless continuation. For example, if initially Claude said “Let me check that…”, and after the tool it says “the result is 42.”, the final rendered message becomes “Let me check that… the result is 42.” with no break in between.
  
  By treating the pre-tool text and post-tool text as one continuous message in the UI, we **avoid the “disappearing content” issue**. In earlier implementations, partial content sometimes got overwritten when the full response rendered – we prevent that by never replacing the placeholder, only updating it. The conversation memory (the `messages` list) will still record the assistant’s turn as two parts (one assistant role with a `tool_use` content, followed by the tool result as a user message, then another assistant role with final content), but the UI merges them visually.

- **Robust Tool Integration & Error Handling:** The streaming loop needs to integrate with the agent loop’s tool usage. In the Claude DC agent code (likely in `loop.py` or similar), after calling the model we handle tool blocks. We will adapt it for streaming:
  - Instead of waiting for the entire model response, we process events. Pseudocode for one cycle:
    ```python
    tool_request = None
    for event in response_stream:
        if event.type == "content_block_delta":
            if tool_request: 
                # If we've gotten a tool request already, ignore further content (model might be sending it but we'll break)
                continue
            if event.delta.type == "text":
                output_callback(event.delta)  # display normal text chunk
            elif event.delta.type == "tool_use":
                tool_request = event.delta   # capture the tool request details
                break  # break out to handle tool
    if tool_request:
        # Execute the tool
        result = tool_collection.run(name=tool_request.name, tool_input=tool_request.input)
        tool_output_callback(result, tool_request.id)  # show tool output or log
        # Append tool result to messages and call Claude again for continuation...
    ```
    The idea is that we break the streaming as soon as a `tool_use` block comes through. We then run the tool and send the result back into Claude (as a new user message containing a `tool_result` block) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py#:~:text=tool_result_content%3A%20list)) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py#:~:text=)). After that, we start a new streaming loop for Claude’s continuation. This design interweaves streaming and tool usage in real time.
  - **Recovery and retries:** If a tool fails (throws an exception or returns an error), we capture that and feed it back to Claude as a result (perhaps as an error message). Claude may choose to handle the error (e.g., try a different approach or apologize). We also implement a simple retry mechanism for transient failures:
    - If the Anthropic API streaming call itself errors out (e.g., network issue or timeout), catch the exception, backoff briefly, and retry the call. Since we have a token-management system in place (with Fibonacci backoff) this should rarely happen ([YOUR_Home.md](file://file-6V13JAtY9gN6JhJjb89nxv#:~:text=The%20key%20insights%20here%3A%20,system%20isn%27t%20delaying%20operations%20properly)) ([YOUR_Home.md](file://file-6V13JAtY9gN6JhJjb89nxv#:~:text=1,retry%20mechanism%20for%20429%20errors)).
    - If we receive a rate-limit 429 during streaming (unlikely if streaming, but possible if hitting the per-minute quota), also delay and retry. We’ve already integrated a **Fibonacci delay pattern** and more conservative token usage to avoid this ([YOUR_Home.md](file://file-6V13JAtY9gN6JhJjb89nxv#:~:text=Current%20Issue%20Claude%20DC%20is,calculations%20may%20not%20be%20sufficient)), so ideally no retries are needed. But Claude Code can ensure this logic is present.
    - Limit tool retries to avoid loops. For example, if the same tool fails multiple times, break and let Claude respond without that tool or with a failure message.
  
By implementing streaming in this manner, **Claude DC can think and act in an uninterrupted flow**. The assistant’s thought process is visible to the user as it streams out, tools are invoked seamlessly, and the final answer arrives without long pauses or lost text. The system will also automatically avoid the “long output timeout” issues by streaming — Anthropic recommends streaming or their batch API for responses that are very lengthy ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=intended%20for%20very%20long%20requests,it%E2%80%99s%20good%20to%20know%20it)). With streaming on, even a 10+ minute, 20k-token answer will continuously deliver tokens and **not** trigger HTTP timeouts ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=,as%20long%20as%20data%20flows)) ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=%28end,needed%20for%2010%2B%20minute%20outputs)). (We have verified that the Anthropic SDK’s default behavior is to wait indefinitely while tokens stream, so it can handle extremely long generations ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=%28end,needed%20for%2010%2B%20minute%20outputs)).)

## Tier 4 Enhancements Implementation
With streaming support in place, we next implement the Tier 4 enhancements to maximize Claude DC’s capabilities. These include **Prompt Caching**, **Extended 128K Output**, **disabling token-efficient tool use**, and **real-time tool output streaming**. Each is addressed below:

### Prompt Caching via Ephemeral Checkpoints
Prompt caching is a powerful Anthropic feature that can drastically reduce token usage for iterative conversations by reusing computation for unchanged prompt segments ([Prompt caching - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#:~:text=Prompt%20caching%20is%20a%20powerful,or%20prompts%20with%20consistent%20elements)). We enable this so that Claude DC can handle long sessions more efficiently. The strategy is to mark certain messages in the conversation with a **“cache_control”** of type `ephemeral`, which signals the API that it can reuse the work up to that point for subsequent calls ([chatgpt-v3-debug.txt](file://file-NMbxsYnpM7QWhsSHxzwaRK#:~:text=list%29%3A%20if%20breakpoints_remaining%3A%20breakpoints_remaining%20,1%5D.pop%28%5C%22cache_control%5C%22%2C%20None%29%20%23%20type%3A%20ignore)).

**Implementation:**
- We include the **Prompt Caching beta flag** in our API requests. Anthropic’s docs specify adding the header `prompt-caching-2024-07-31` to opt-in ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py#:~:text=from%20anthropic)) ([anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py at main · anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts · GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py#:~:text=)). In the SDK call, we can pass `betas=["prompt-caching-2024-07-31"]` (along with other beta flags). 
- In the agent loop code, after each new user message (or tool result) is added to the `messages` list, we call a helper to tag the last few messages as ephemeral. For example:
  ```python
  def _inject_prompt_caching(messages: list[BetaMessageParam], n=3):
      # Set cache_control on the last n user messages
      count = n
      for msg in reversed(messages):
          if msg["role"] == "user" and isinstance(msg["content"], list):
              # mark the *last block* of the message as ephemeral
              if count > 0:
                  msg["content"][-1]["cache_control"] = BetaCacheControlEphemeralParam({"type": "ephemeral"})
                  count -= 1
              else:
                  # Remove any older cache_control markers to keep cache consistent
                  msg["content"][-1].pop("cache_control", None)
      return messages
  ```
  In our case, we might mark the **3 most recent user turns** as ephemeral and ensure older ones are not marked (to maintain a single cache breakpoint). This code is derived from the logic in the reference implementation ([chatgpt-v3-debug.txt](file://file-NMbxsYnpM7QWhsSHxzwaRK#:~:text=for%20message%20in%20reversed,1%5D.pop%28%5C%22cache_control%5C%22%2C%20None%29%20%23%20type)).
- Marking the last few user messages means that Claude will treat everything *above* those in the conversation as a reusable prefix. As the conversation grows, the cache can be updated. Anthropic’s system currently supports only `ephemeral` type (which has a minimum 5-minute TTL) ([Prompt caching - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#:~:text=The%20cache%20has%20a%20minimum,minute%20lifetime)), meaning if you reuse the same prompt structure within 5 minutes, it won’t recompute the earlier parts. This suits our use case of a continuous session.
- We must use the caching flag **consistently** on every request we want to cache ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=To%20keep%20the%20benefits%20of,it%2C%20prompt%20caching%20will%20fail)). Claude Code will ensure that *every* Claude DC API call includes the caching beta (once turned on) so the cache isn’t invalidated by inconsistent use.

With prompt caching enabled, repetitive long prompts (like re-sending large system or context every tool loop) are greatly optimized. The model will reuse the computation for the static parts of the prompt, leading to faster responses and lower token costs. From Anthropic’s prompt caching example, once the cache is warm, new requests can skip re-processing tens of thousands of tokens of prior context ([Prompt caching - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#:~:text=Prompt%20caching%20is%20a%20powerful,or%20prompts%20with%20consistent%20elements)). 

### Extended 128K-Token Output Support
Claude 3 models (both **Opus** and **Sonnet** versions) support very large context windows (up to 200k tokens of input) ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Context%20Window%20,that%20implies%20the%20large%20context)). However, by default they were limited to around 4k tokens **output** per completion ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Output%20Length%3A%20By%20default%2C%20Claude,allow%20outputs%20up%20to%20128k)). Recently, Anthropic introduced an **Extended Output Beta** to allow much longer generations (up to 128k tokens in a single answer) on Claude 3.7 Sonnet ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=mark%20%E2%80%93%20that%20far%20exceeds,For%20example)). We enable this so Claude DC can produce extremely lengthy responses when needed (e.g., for exhaustive analyses or writing large files).

**Implementation:**
- Use the **128k output beta flag** in API calls. According to documentation, we include `output-128k-2025-02-19` in the request headers to raise the output limit to 128k for Claude 3.7 Sonnet ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=mark%20%E2%80%93%20that%20far%20exceeds,For%20example)). In the SDK, this means adding `"output-128k-2025-02-19"` to the `betas` list on `client.messages.create`.
- Ensure the **model ID** in use supports it. We will use the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model (e.g., `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` as of this date) which the quickstart already defaults to ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20%22claude,using%20the%20appropriate%20model%20variant)). This model has the large context window and is eligible for extended output. (Claude 3 Opus could also support it, but Sonnet is the recommended one for this due to ease of enabling and its strong capabilities ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Claude%203%20Opus%20Extended%20Output%3A,with%20huge%20output%2C%20reach%20out)).)
- Set a high `max_tokens` when calling the API. We can request up to 128000 tokens in the completion. However, as a safeguard, the team decided on **optimal limits**: about **64k tokens max** for a single answer, with a **“thinking” budget of 32k tokens** for Claude’s chain-of-thought ([readme-LAST_current-prompt-update-message.md](file://file-RWVj1z5fHF4xgkn5BEkyNQ#:~:text=1.%20,max%20tokens%2C%2032K%20thinking%20budget)). We will implement these as configuration constants. For example:
  ```python
  MAX_TOKENS = 65536  # limit actual answer length to ~64k
  THINKING_BUDGET = 32768  # allow up to 32k tokens of internal 'thinking'
  extra_body = {"thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": THINKING_BUDGET}}
  response = client.beta.messages.create(..., max_tokens=MAX_TOKENS, betas=[...], extra_body=extra_body)
  ```
  Here we set Claude’s “extended thinking” mode on with a budget (this allows Claude to use some of its tokens for internal reasoning that isn’t directly printed, enhancing coherence on complex tasks). The `extra_body.thinking` param and budget were introduced by Anthropic to let the model use its hidden scratchpad – we configure it per the values given in the plan (32k) ([readme-LAST_current-prompt-update-message.md](file://file-RWVj1z5fHF4xgkn5BEkyNQ#:~:text=1.%20,max%20tokens%2C%2032K%20thinking%20budget)).
- By enabling this, Claude DC will **no longer cut off** long answers at ~4k tokens. We have effectively told it we can handle very long outputs. It’s important we use streaming with this, because a 50k-token output could take many minutes; streaming ensures the user sees it gradually and prevents HTTP timeouts ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=intended%20for%20very%20long%20requests,it%E2%80%99s%20good%20to%20know%20it)). 

**Note on model choice:** If we ever need the absolute maximum context and reasoning power, we could use Claude 3 Opus model (supports 200k input tokens and potentially longer outputs via Batch API) ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Claude%203%20Opus%20Extended%20Output%3A,with%20huge%20output%2C%20reach%20out)). However, Opus might still have the 4k output cap via normal API. For now, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with the extended output beta is the most straightforward way to get huge responses ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Summary%3A%20Use%20the%20Claude%203,com)). We’ll proceed with Sonnet 3.7, which Anthropic calls “our most advanced model yet” and has both the large context and the new features we need.

### Prioritizing Stability over Token-Efficient Tool Use 
Anthropic recently introduced a **token-efficient tool use (beta)** for Claude 3.7, which aims to save tokens when the model calls tools ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=Token)). In theory, Claude will economize its prompts around tool usage, yielding an average of ~14% fewer output tokens (and up to 70% savings in some cases) ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=The%20upgraded%20Claude%203,overall%20response%20shape%20and%20size)). However, this feature is experimental and not guaranteed to work seamlessly with our multi-turn agent loop. In fact, Anthropic notes it currently doesn’t work with certain options (like parallel tool use) ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=Token,currently%20work%20with%20disable_parallel_tool_use)) and that inconsistent use can interfere with prompt caching ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=To%20keep%20the%20benefits%20of,it%2C%20prompt%20caching%20will%20fail)). Given that our focus is robustness and our caching mechanism is in play, we will **disable token-efficient tool use** for now.

**Implementation:**
- Simply **do not include** the beta flag `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` in our API calls. If the quickstart or our code had this flag by default, we remove it. (It’s an opt-in beta, so unless we explicitly added it, it’s likely off already. We double-check the `betas` list to ensure it only contains the flags we want: caching and extended output.)
- If at some point this beta becomes stable, we might reconsider. But currently, keeping full context during tool use is safer. It ensures Claude DC has the complete picture each turn, at the cost of some extra tokens. Since we’ve enabled caching, the token overhead is partly mitigated anyway.
- Document this decision in the system prompts or config so all AI “family members” know we favor reliability over minor token savings.

By **not** using the token-efficient mode, we avoid potential issues where Claude’s responses might be truncated or formatted unexpectedly around tool calls. This keeps the agent loop logic simpler and maintains compatibility with our caching (Anthropic specifically warns that mixing use of this beta can cause prompt caching to fail) ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=To%20keep%20the%20benefits%20of,it%2C%20prompt%20caching%20will%20fail)). The negligible increase in token usage is acceptable given the improvements in stability and clarity.

### Real-Time Tool Output Streaming and Tracking
In the current Claude DC setup, when a tool is executed (e.g., running a Python script, or performing a web action), the user sees the outcome only after the tool finishes. To make the experience more interactive, we want to **stream tool outputs in real time** as well. For instance, if Claude DC runs a script that produces incremental logs, those logs should appear live in the UI. Similarly, if a long browser interaction is happening, we might show intermediate steps (though in our headless environment this mainly applies to text-based tools).

**Implementation ideas:**
- **Modify `tool_collection.run` for certain tools to yield output:** For example, for the Bash or Python tool, instead of executing and waiting for completion, we can execute the subprocess and stream its stdout. In Python, this can be done by spawning the process with `stdout=PIPE` and reading line by line. The tool can then call `tool_output_callback` for each line or chunk. We might implement an asynchronous generator for tool outputs.
  - Pseudocode for a streaming shell tool:
    ```python
    import subprocess, shlex
    def run_shell_command(cmd: str):
        process = subprocess.Popen(shlex.split(cmd), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)
        for line in process.stdout:
            yield line  # yield each line of output
        process.wait()
    ```
    Then in `tool_collection.run`, if the tool is of type “shell” and the command is safe to stream, we iterate over `run_shell_command(input)` and for each chunk, call `tool_output_callback(chunk, tool_id)`. This will send the partial output to the Streamlit UI (perhaps appending to a separate output box or console log area).
- **UI display for tool output:** We can designate an area of the interface for live tool output (for example, a collapsible panel or a code block that fills with the tool’s stdout). If the output is an image or file, we handle it as before (show when ready). If it’s text, stream it. For instance, if the user asks Claude to run a long computation, they could see a live log of that computation’s progress (instead of wondering if it hung).
- **Track tool execution status:** To further improve UX, we can log when a tool starts and when it ends. For example, just before running a tool, we might display a line like “*(Executing **ToolName**...)*”. When done, display “*(Tool **ToolName** finished)*”. This, along with streaming the content, gives complete transparency.
- **Safety considerations:** Streaming tool output is generally fine for text. We should still route it through the Safe Ops filter if applicable (the Safe File Ops or other guardrails should continue to sanitize output if needed). In practice, if the tool output contained sensitive info, the assistant would see it anyway when we feed it back, so showing it to the authorized user in real-time is not a problem. Just be mindful of not streaming something extremely large unnecessarily (we can truncate or collapse very verbose logs).

By implementing this, **Claude DC’s tool use becomes much more interactive**. The user can see what the AI is doing under the hood in real time. This is especially useful for lengthy operations: the incremental feedback reassures that progress is being made and also allows the user (or developer) to spot if something is going wrong (e.g., a tool stuck in a loop) and intervene if needed. It transforms the experience into watching a live execution, rather than waiting blind. 

*(Note: If some tools are very quick (e.g., grabbing a single screenshot), streaming their output isn’t needed – they will finish almost immediately and the result can be shown. We primarily target this feature for tools like running code, long shell commands, downloads, etc. Claude Code will implement this selectively to avoid complicating simple tool calls.)*

With all Tier 4 enhancements above, we effectively push Claude DC to the cutting edge of its capabilities: using caching and large contexts to handle huge tasks efficiently, streaming everything (model thoughts and tool actions) to maximize transparency and minimizing any unstable experimental features. Next, we set up the autonomous workflow so that these changes can be implemented and deployed by Claude Code itself.

## Autonomous Workflow with Claude Code (No Human in the Loop)
Now that we have a plan for what to change, we delegate the implementation to **Claude Code** – the AI developer agent. Claude Code will perform the following high-level steps autonomously:
1. **Load Project Context & Constraints:** It will read a strategy/architecture file (`CLAUDE.md`) we provide, which describes the Claude DC project structure and important guardrails (safety rules, boundaries not to cross, etc.). This orients the AI developer in the codebase.
2. **Code Modifications:** Based on our objectives, Claude Code will edit the necessary files – e.g., updating the API call parameters (adding `stream=True`, beta flags, etc.), adjusting the streaming loop logic, modifying the Streamlit UI code for placeholders, tweaking the tool execution methods, and so on. It will use its internal logic to find the relevant sections (for instance, searching for where `client.messages.create` is called, where `tool_use` is handled, etc.) and apply the changes.
3. **Run and Test in Dev Container:** Claude Code can then use the `run_dev_container.sh` script (or the equivalent `docker run` command) to start the dev Claude DC container with the new code. Because we pre-configured permission, it can execute this command without asking us. After launching, it may wait a few seconds for Streamlit to start up, then perform tests:
   - It can inspect the container logs (`docker logs claude_dc_dev`) to see if the server started without errors.
   - It might even send a test query to Claude DC. Since the dev container doesn’t have a simple API endpoint exposed (UI only), Claude Code could open the streamlit interface via an HTTP request or simulate a minimal interaction. A straightforward test is to look for a log line like “Running on local URL…” to confirm startup, then perhaps trigger a simple question by calling the underlying `sampling_loop` function via a small Python snippet. (This step can be as involved as we allow; a basic sanity check is fine.)
   - If any errors or exceptions are detected (for example, a Python syntax error or a NameError in our changes), Claude Code will catch them (the error would appear in the container log or the streamlit debug output). It will then jump back into the code to fix the bug and rerun the container. This edit-run-debug cycle continues autonomously until the dev instance runs smoothly with the new features.
4. **Verification of Features:** We want Claude Code to verify that streaming and other features are working. It can do this by analyzing logs or behaviors:
   - For streaming: Ensure that the API calls are indeed being made with `stream=True` (maybe by logging a confirmation or by noticing responses arriving token-wise). Claude Code might insert a temporary log print like “Streaming mode ON” right after the API call, and check it appears.
   - For prompt caching: It can verify that the `cache_control` fields are present in the message objects or that subsequent calls mention using the cache (the Anthropc SDK might not explicitly log cache hits, but we trust it).
   - For extended outputs: Possibly run a test with `max_tokens` high and see if no warning or error appears. If the model produces a very long dummy output (Claude Code could prompt the dev Claude DC with a request to “repeat the word test 10000 times” and see if it does so without truncation), that confirms extended output is active. Of course, that’s a bit extreme; this can be optional.
   - For tool output streaming: This is trickier to auto-verify, but Claude Code could simulate a scenario (maybe ask Claude DC to run a sample shell command) and see if the intermediate output is logged in the dev container console. Alternatively, just ensure the code paths are in place (manual verification might be needed eventually, but we can rely on code review by the AI itself).
5. **Deploy to Production:** Once satisfied, Claude Code will promote the changes. This involves:
   - **Backup current production**: (If not already done recently) instruct Claude DC or use a script to copy the live folder to a backup location. We have `/home/computeruse/my_stable_backup_complete/` for stable backups ([YOUR_Home.md](file://file-6V13JAtY9gN6JhJjb89nxv#:~:text=2,home%2Fcomputeruse%2Fmy_stable_backup_complete)). Claude Code can run a command to copy the live directory or files to a dated backup folder. This ensures we can roll back if needed.
   - **Update live code**: Since the live container is using the volume at `/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/`, Claude Code can copy the modified files from the GitHub repo to that directory. If the live container has auto-reload on, it will pick up changes immediately. (We should coordinate this carefully to avoid partial updates – copying all changed files quickly or, safer, bringing down the live container briefly.)
     - One approach: Stop the live container (`docker stop claude_dc`) and remove it (`docker rm claude_dc`), then re-run it using the same image but mounting the updated code (or simply restart it if it shares the volume with updated files). This ensures a clean start with new code. Downtime is just a container restart.
     - Another approach: Since it’s the same host and same path, if we used the GitHub repo directly as the live volume or if we sync the repo to that path, Streamlit’s auto-reload will update the app in place. In that case, no restart is needed – the changes go live instantly. We need to be cautious that the live session state might get reset when the code reloads, but that’s usually acceptable.
   - **Final verification**: Claude Code can run a quick check on the live container just like it did for dev, to confirm the service is running with the new version.
   - **Commit changes**: Have Claude Code commit the changes to the GitHub repository (and push, if configured). This keeps our version control up to date. Claude Code can use `git` commands for this, which can be pre-approved or executed with the skip-permission flag.

All the above steps can be performed by Claude Code within one continuous conversation/session, given the right prompting. We will provide that prompt now.

### `CLAUDE.md` – Strategy & Guardrails for Claude Code
We create a file `CLAUDE.md` in the repository for Claude Code to read. This file explains the project and sets boundaries. Here’s the content we will use for `CLAUDE.md`:

# Claude Code Developer Guidelines (PALIOS AI OS)

**Project:** PALIOS AI OS – Claude DC (“The Conductor”) implementation  
**Role:** *Claude Code* – Autonomous Builder & Debugger (AI Developer Agent)  

## Overview
Claude DC is an AI agent (Anthropic Claude 3.7) running in a Dockerized environment with tool-use capabilities (Computer Use beta). It orchestrates an “AI Family” by performing complex tasks with a large context and various tools. Your job as Claude Code is to **safely enhance and debug Claude DC’s capabilities** by modifying its codebase. Work autonomously through the development cycle: plan, code, test, and deploy, without human intervention, while respecting all safety and system constraints.

The codebase is located in this repository and primarily consists of:
- **Agent loop & UI (Streamlit)** – e.g., `computer_use_demo/loop.py` and associated Streamlit app scripts. This manages the conversation with Claude and tool invocations.
- **Tool definitions** – in `computer_use_demo/tools/` (e.g., tools for Bash, Python, browser, etc.).
- **Configuration files** – e.g., `conductor-config.json` containing system parameters (token limits, backoff settings, etc.).
- Supporting files like `Dockerfile`, `setup.sh`, etc., for the environment setup (these generally don’t need modification for our task).

## Goals for Current Task
Implement the **Phase 2 enhancements** for Claude DC:
1. **Streaming Responses:** Enable `stream=True` for Claude’s API calls so responses stream token-by-token. Update the UI to display incremental output and ensure partial replies are not lost when tools are used.
2. **Tool Integration in Stream:** Allow Claude to use tools mid-response without issues. Maintain any text already output, run the tool, then continue streaming the rest of the answer. Handle tool errors gracefully (no crashes or stalled responses).
3. **Prompt Caching:** Use Anthropic’s prompt caching beta so repeated context isn’t recomputed each turn. Mark the last few user messages with `cache_control: ephemeral` and include the prompt caching beta flag in API calls.
4. **128K Extended Output:** Enable the extended output beta to allow very long answers (up to ~128k tokens). Adjust `max_tokens` and utilize the thinking token budget for optimal performance (target ~64k max output, 32k thinking).
5. **Stability Fixes:** Disable any “token-efficient tool use” beta or behavior that might drop context. Ensure full conversation context is available to Claude each turn for reliability. 
6. **Real-Time Tool Output:** If possible, stream tool outputs (like command-line results) to the user interface in real time. This may involve tweaking how tool subprocesses are run and using callbacks to update the UI continually during tool execution.

You should implement all the above in code. Code changes likely involve `loop.py` (or wherever `client.messages.create` is called and the agent loop runs) and possibly tool implementations (for output streaming). Also update config flags (e.g., add beta flags) and any Streamlit UI components.

After coding, **test the system in the dev Docker container**:
- Launch the dev container (see `run_dev_container.sh`) and verify Claude DC starts without errors.
- Test a simple query and a tool invocation scenario to ensure streaming and tool usage work as expected (e.g., ask Claude in the dev UI to perform a calculation that uses the Python tool, and observe the streaming behavior).

Iterate on fixes as needed until all features work robustly.

Finally, deploy the updates to the live environment:
- Back up the current live code (to avoid any irreversible mistakes).
- Apply the code changes to the live folder or restart the live container with the new code.
- Ensure the live Claude DC is running with streaming and new features enabled.

## Constraints and Guardrails
- **Do NOT disrupt live operations** until ready to deploy. Use the dev environment for all testing. The live container should only be updated when you are confident in the changes.
- **Safe Operations:** Claude DC has a Safe File Operations module and other guardrails. Do not remove or weaken any safety checks. All file writes or system commands should go through approved tool interfaces. (No direct `os.remove` on arbitrary files, etc.)
- **Anthropic Policy Compliance:** Adhere to content and usage guidelines. (No leaking sensitive info, no instructions outside the scope of coding/dev tasks, etc.) 
- **Resource Limits:** Keep within rate limits. The token management (sliding window, backoff) is in place – maintain or improve it, but do not disable it. If you need to adjust delays or buffer thresholds to avoid 429 errors, do so conservatively.
- **Code Style:** Follow the existing coding style and structure. Make incremental changes with clear comments if needed. Ensure any added code is well-documented so future developers (or AI agents) can understand it.
- **Testing:** Unit tests are minimal, so rely on integration testing via the running container. Be thorough in trying different scenarios (multiple tool calls in one response, long outputs, etc.) to catch edge cases.
- **Logging:** Prefer to log important events (like “Streaming started”, “Tool X called”, “Cache activated”) to aid debugging. But do not log sensitive data. Use debug logs that can be turned off in production if verbose.
- **Trust and Coordination:** You are part of the AI Family working on PALIOS. Coordinate with “Claude DC” (The Conductor) as needed by reading its outputs or using its feedback after test queries. You also have a trust token as the Builder (implicitly granted by the human facilitator). Use this autonomy responsibly to improve the system.

By following these guidelines, you will implement the required features safely and effectively. Once deployment is done, document the changes in `CHANGES.md` (or a similar file) and notify Claude DC (The Conductor) that the environment has been upgraded to Tier 4.

*End of CLAUDE.md.*
```

This **CLAUDE.md** provides Claude Code with a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be done and the rules to follow. It essentially serves as the “system prompt” or reference for the AI developer. It covers the project architecture, the specific tasks (streaming, caching, etc.), testing/deployment procedure, and important safety constraints (don’t break things, follow policy, etc.). Claude Code will refer to this as it works.

### Delegation Prompt for Claude Code
Finally, we craft the user prompt that we will give to Claude Code in the CLI to kick off this whole autonomous process. We will include the content of `CLAUDE.md` (so it definitely has it in context) and then explicitly instruct the agent to begin implementation. According to our earlier guidance, it’s best to put the entire prompt in one message (e.g., wrapped in triple backticks) so it can be processed as one unit ([YOUR_Home.md](file://file-6V13JAtY9gN6JhJjb89nxv#:~:text=Putting%20Claude%20DC%20Prompts%20in,code%20blocks%2C%20instructions%2C%20and%20examples)). For example:

````markdown
``` 
You are Claude Code, the AI Developer agent. Proceed to implement the Phase 2 enhancements for Claude DC as detailed below. 

Refer to the file CLAUDE.md for overall strategy and guardrails (it’s included here):

[Contents of CLAUDE.md can be inserted here, or you can open CLAUDE.md in the repository]

In summary, your tasks:
1. Enable streaming responses in Claude DC (use stream=True, update UI for incremental output, maintain partial text through tool calls).
2. Integrate tool usage into streaming loop with proper handling (no lost content, handle errors, allow multiple tool calls if needed).
3. Activate prompt caching (add ephemeral cache_control on recent user messages, include prompt-caching beta flag).
4. Enable extended 128k output (include output-128k beta, set max_tokens ~65536, thinking budget ~32768).
5. Turn off token-efficient tools beta (ensure it's not in use).
6. Stream tool outputs in real-time to the UI (for long-running commands).

**Make code changes** in the repository accordingly. Then use `run_dev_container.sh` to launch the dev container and test the new functionality. Ensure everything works: the model streams outputs, uses tools seamlessly, and no regressions or new errors are introduced.

You have full permission to run commands and edit files as needed (this session is configured to skip manual confirmations). Use the safeguards and follow the guidelines – do not do anything outside the scope of improving Claude DC.

Work through the steps autonomously. Explain your changes and actions in the notes (so I can follow along), and mark each major step complete. If tests reveal issues, fix them and retest.

Once the dev tests pass, deploy the changes to production:
- Backup the live environment.
- Apply the updated code to the live container (you may restart it with the new code).
- Verify the live Claude DC is running with streaming and enhancements.

Conclude by confirming that Claude DC is now updated and list the changes implemented.

Now, begin the implementation. Good luck!
``` 
````

The above prompt (when given to Claude Code in the terminal) does the following:
- Sets the context that it’s Claude Code and has a job to do.
- Includes the `CLAUDE.md` (or at least references it; we can paste it in or ensure Claude Code loads it from the repo – since it “understands your codebase,” it might retrieve it on its own if we mention it).
- Lists the tasks clearly.
- Grants permission (“You have full permission to run commands…skip confirmations”) – this reinforces that we already set `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- Tells it to *show its thinking and mark steps complete*. (In practice, Claude Code will likely output its plan and confirmation messages in the terminal as it works. We want it to be verbose so we can monitor progress, even if we’re not intervening.)
- Finally, instructs it to deploy and verify.

At this point, Claude Code should autonomously carry out the plan:
- It will read `CLAUDE.md` for details.
- It might print a plan (e.g., “Alright, I will modify loop.py for streaming, etc.”).
- It will open files (like `loop.py`) and make edits. For example, add `stream=True` and event handling, add the beta flags in the API call, adjust the logic as discussed. It will then save the file.
- It will modify tools (maybe `tools.py` or whichever file runs the shell tool) to stream outputs, adding a generator or similar.
- It might modify the Streamlit interface script to handle partial outputs (though likely the loop itself can handle UI via callbacks).
- It will run `bash run_dev_container.sh`. Because we allowed that, the dev container will start. It will see the output in the Claude Code terminal or via `docker logs`.
- If an error occurs (say we made a typo in code), the Streamlit app might crash; the log will show a traceback. Claude Code will catch that, open the file, fix the typo, and try again – all by itself. This loop continues until the dev container runs successfully.
- Claude Code might then simulate a user message. If not via HTTP, it could do something like: open a Python REPL inside the container to call the agent loop function. But it might be content with just “no errors = good”. Ideally, because we explicitly asked it to ensure streaming and tool usage work, it might actually attempt a sample conversation. It could do this by leveraging the tools in the container, but that might be complex. Even without that, it can reason about the changes logically or perhaps do a limited test (like call the model with a dummy prompt directly via SDK in a small script).
- Once satisfied, it will perform the deploy steps. Possibly it will stop the live container and rerun it with new code, or copy files over. We gave it permission for `docker stop` and such by allow-list. It will likely do:
  - `docker stop claude_dc` (assuming that’s the live container name),
  - `docker cp [files] claude_dc:/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/...` (or use volumes),
  - Or it might decide to rebuild an image and deploy – but mounting code is easier, it might just copy.
  - It will start the container again (`docker start claude_dc` if we didn’t remove it, or `docker run ...` similarly to dev but with live paths/ports).
- After deployment, it will perhaps ping the live instance (or just confirm it started).
- Finally, it will print a summary: e.g., “All tasks complete. Claude DC now streams responses, uses caching, etc. Tier 4 enhancements are in place.”

At that point, our autonomous workflow is done. We (the human) didn’t have to manually edit code or manually test beyond giving that initial prompt and watching.

## Conclusion
In this guide, we developed a comprehensive plan to upgrade Claude DC with streaming and advanced features, and to use Claude Code as an autonomous developer to implement those upgrades. By following this plan, we achieve the following:
- **Claude DC** (The Conductor) is now running with full streaming output, robust tool handling, prompt caching, and extended token capabilities (128k context) ([readme-LAST_current-prompt-update-message.md](file://file-RWVj1z5fHF4xgkn5BEkyNQ#:~:text=We%27ve%20implemented%20a%20token%20management,system%20that)). It can provide much longer and more interactive responses than before, without crashing or timing out. We explicitly avoided the risky token-efficient mode to ensure stability ([Token-efficient tool use (beta) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use#:~:text=To%20use%20this%20beta%20feature%2C,anthropic.beta.messages)).
- **Claude Code** (The Builder) is set up to manage the development lifecycle with minimal oversight. We provided it with a structured strategy (`CLAUDE.md`) and a one-shot prompt to carry out the coding, testing, and deployment steps. Thanks to this, code changes are implemented safely and systematically, and future improvements can be entrusted to Claude Code as well.
- The **Tier 4 enhancements** (prompt caching, etc.) should greatly improve performance: prompt caching will save computation on repetitive turns, and extended outputs allow Claude DC to tackle tasks that produce very large results (for example, writing extensive documents or analyzing huge texts) ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=Output%20Length%3A%20By%20default%2C%20Claude,allow%20outputs%20up%20to%20128k)) ([claude-dc-extended-use-guidance.md](file://file-DBPwmtHNm57yoy88inS29a#:~:text=mark%20%E2%80%93%20that%20far%20exceeds,For%20example)). The user experience is smoother with continuous streaming of both Claude’s thoughts and tool outputs.
- We have maintained strong **guardrails** throughout: the Safe File Ops module remains in place, and we instructed Claude Code to respect all safety constraints. All autonomous actions are confined to the development environment until ready, preventing accidental interference with the live system.

Going forward, the **PALIOS AI OS** is better equipped for “layer 2” implementation and beyond. Claude DC can focus on high-level orchestration with its new capabilities, and Claude Code can handle the heavy lifting of any code evolution. This autonomous workflow – combining Claude’s intelligence with direct system access under controlled conditions – exemplifies the next-generation AI-augmented development operations.
