### Key Points
- Research suggests that the Anthropic Quickstart computer_use_demo likely supports streaming through its Streamlit interface, but setting `stream=True` in the API call may cause errors if the code isn't designed to handle it directly.
- It seems likely that the demo uses `client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create` to manage streaming manually, parsing server-sent events (SSE) for real-time updates in the UI.
- The evidence leans toward errors occurring due to incorrect modifications, such as adding `stream=True` to an incompatible API call or mismanaging the streaming response.
- To enable streaming, you may need to ensure the demo runs as intended without changes or modify `loop.py` to use `client.messages.stream()` correctly.

### Understanding the Issue
You're trying to enable streaming in the Anthropic Quickstart computer_use_demo, but setting `stream=True` in the code throws errors despite following the Docker setup instructions. This suggests a mismatch between your modifications and the demo's streaming implementation. The demo is designed to showcase Claude's computer use capabilities, including tool use, and uses a Streamlit app for interaction, which likely handles streaming for the UI.

### Steps to Enable Streaming
1. **Run the Demo Unmodified**: The demo likely supports streaming out of the box through its Streamlit interface. Run it as provided to verify if streaming works without changes. Use the Docker command from the [README](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/README.md):
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
   docker run -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -v $HOME/.anthropic:/home/computeruse/.anthropic -p 5900:5900 -p 8501:8501 -p 6080:6080 -p 8080:8080 -it ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest
   ```
   Access the interface at `http://localhost:8080` to check if responses stream in the UI.

2. **Check SDK Version**: The demo requires `anthropic>=0.39.0` ([requirements.txt](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/requirements.txt)). Your SDK version (0.50.0) is compatible, but ensure the Docker container uses the correct version by checking the container's environment.

3. **Review Code Modifications**: If you modified `loop.py` to add `stream=True` to `client.messages.create`, this may conflict with the demo's use of `client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create`, which handles streaming manually. Instead, consider using `client.messages.stream()` for explicit streaming support, as shown in the provided artifact.

4. **Debug Errors**: Without specific error messages, common issues include:
   - **Incorrect API Call**: Using `stream=True` with `with_raw_response` may return an unexpected response type.
   - **Event Handling**: The code may not be set up to parse SSE events from a streaming response.
   - **Network Issues**: Docker port mappings or network restrictions may disrupt streaming.

### Recommended Code Adjustment
If streaming isn't working as expected, modify `loop.py` to use `client.messages.stream()` for proper streaming support. Below is an updated version of the `sampling_loop` function to handle streaming correctly.

```python

                    print("Max retries reached:", retry_error)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(sampling_loop())
```

### Next Steps

### Comprehensive Analysis of Enabling Streaming in Anthropic Quickstart Computer Use Demo

This report provides a detailed analysis of the requirements to enable streaming in the Anthropic Quickstart computer_use_demo, addressing the user’s issue where setting `stream=True` in the API call throws errors despite following the Docker setup instructions. The analysis leverages provided attachments, web research, and official Anthropic documentation to ensure a comprehensive solution, tailored to the user’s environment (Anthropic SDK v0.50.0, Python 3.11.6, Claude 3.7 Sonnet model) as of 02:57 PM EDT on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. It aims to fill gaps for "Claude Code," which lacks access to documentation or web searches, and provides a production-ready approach to resolve the streaming issue.

#### Background and Context
The user is attempting to enable streaming in the Anthropic Quickstart computer_use_demo, a GitHub repository ([Anthropic Quickstarts](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts)) designed to showcase Claude’s computer use capabilities, including tool use, through a Streamlit-based interface. They followed the Docker setup instructions but encountered errors when setting `stream=True` in the API call, suggesting a mismatch between their modifications and the demo’s implementation. The demo uses Docker to run a containerized environment, exposing ports for VNC (5900), Streamlit (8501), noVNC (6080), and the web interface (8080). The user’s environment includes Anthropic SDK v0.50.0, which is compatible with the demo’s requirement of `anthropic>=0.39.0` ([requirements.txt](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/requirements.txt)).

#### Analysis of Provided Information
The user’s previous interactions provided context through attachments:
- **requirements.txt**: Confirms `anthropic==0.50.0` for their implementation, but the demo specifies `anthropic>=0.39.0`, ensuring compatibility.
- **loop.py**: Indicates API calls with streaming (`stream=True`), tool use, and thinking parameters, suggesting the user’s implementation attempts streaming but may not align with the demo’s approach.
- **streamlit.py**: Likely handles UI rendering, with fixes for message format errors, indicating streaming is part of the UI experience.
- **IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md**: Notes fixes for tool use IDs, message formats, and thinking parameters (temperature 1.0, budget ≥1024 tokens, `max_tokens` exceeding budget), suggesting streaming is intended but may require specific configurations.

The user’s claim that “it says you just have to set streaming=True” likely refers to the [Anthropic Streaming Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming), which states that setting `stream=True` in the Messages API enables server-sent events (SSE). However, errors suggest the demo’s code may not handle this parameter as expected.

#### Web Research Findings
Web searches for “Anthropic Quickstart computer_use_demo” and related terms identified key resources:
- **Repository Overview** ([Anthropic Quickstarts](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts)): The demo is part of Anthropic’s quickstart projects, updated as of October 23, 2024, supporting Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s computer use capabilities.
- **README** ([README.md](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/README.md)): Details Docker setup but lacks explicit streaming instructions, noting Streamlit’s auto-reloading for development.
- **loop.py** ([loop.py](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/loop.py)): Contains the `sampling_loop` function, using `client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create`, suggesting manual streaming via raw HTTP response parsing.
- **streamlit.py** ([streamlit.py](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/streamlit.py)): Includes streaming output callbacks, indicating UI streaming support.
- **Issues** ([Issue #66](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/issues/66)): Reports port access issues but no streaming-specific problems.

Additional searches for “Anthropic API streaming with tool use issues” revealed:
- A TypeScript SDK issue ([Issue #529](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/issues/529)) about long delays with streaming and tools, but not Python-specific.
- No direct Python SDK issues for streaming, suggesting it’s a standard feature ([Streaming Messages](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming)).

#### Streaming Implementation in the Demo
The demo’s `loop.py` uses `client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create`, which returns a raw HTTP response, likely parsing SSE events for streaming. The `streamlit.py` file includes callbacks for streaming output, confirming that the UI displays responses in real-time. The demo’s design suggests streaming is enabled by default, managed through these callbacks, rather than requiring `stream=True` in the API call. Setting `stream=True` directly in `client.messages.create` may conflict with this setup, as the code expects a raw response, not a stream object.

Common reasons for errors when modifying the code include:
- **Response Type Mismatch**: `stream=True` returns a stream object, but the demo’s logic expects a raw response.
- **Event Parsing**: Incorrect handling of SSE events (`content_block_start`, `content_block_delta`, `content_block_stop`).
- **SDK Compatibility**: While v0.50.0 is compatible, modifications may assume newer SDK features.
- **Docker Environment**: Network or permission issues within the container may disrupt streaming.

#### Recommended Solution
To enable streaming correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Run Unmodified Demo**:
   - Use the Docker command from the [README](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo/README.md):
     ```bash
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
     docker run -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -v $HOME/.anthropic:/home/computeruse/.anthropic -p 5900:5900 -p 8501:8501 -p 6080:6080 -p 8080:8080 -it ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest
     ```
   - Access `http://localhost:8080` to verify if responses stream in the Streamlit UI. The demo’s callbacks in `streamlit.py` should handle streaming automatically.

2. **Modify for Explicit Streaming**:
   - If streaming isn’t working or you need explicit control, modify `loop.py` to use `client.messages.stream()` instead of `with_raw_response.create`. The provided artifact updates the `sampling_loop` function to handle streaming events correctly, supporting tool use and computer use beta features.
   - Replace the `sampling_loop` function in `loop.py` with the code in the artifact, ensuring your API key is set.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Check Docker logs for errors: `docker logs <container_id>`.
   - Verify port mappings and network connectivity.
   - If errors persist, note specific messages (e.g., `APIStatusError`, `TypeError`) and consult the [Anthropic Errors Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/errors).

4. **Beta Flags**:
   - For computer use, include the beta header `"anthropic-beta: computer-use-2025-01-24"` in API calls, as shown in the artifact.
   - No additional headers are needed for streaming or standard tools like `bash_20250124` or `text_editor_20250124`.

#### Artifact: Updated loop.py for Streaming
The following artifact provides an updated `sampling_loop` function for `loop.py`, using `client.messages.stream()` to enable streaming with tool use and computer use support. It includes error handling and validation for tool inputs.

                else:
                    print("Max retries reached:", retry_error)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(sampling_loop())
```

#### Potential Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Description | Solution |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Response Type Mismatch** | Setting `stream=True` in `client.messages.create` returns a stream object, incompatible with raw response parsing. | Use `client.messages.stream()` as shown in the artifact, which handles streaming events correctly. |
| **Event Parsing Errors** | Incorrect handling of SSE events like `content_block_delta`. | Ensure the code iterates over stream events, as in the artifact, using `async for event in stream`. |
| **Docker Issues** | Network or port conflicts in the container. | Verify port mappings (`docker ps`) and check logs (`docker logs <container_id>`). |
| **SDK Version** | Potential mismatch between SDK versions. | Confirm the container uses `anthropic>=0.39.0` by checking `requirements.txt` or installing v0.50.0 in the container. |
| **API Key** | Invalid or rate-limited API key. | Validate the API key and check rate limits via the Anthropic Console. |

#### Additional Notes
- **Streaming in Streamlit**: The demo’s Streamlit app uses callbacks to display streaming responses, as noted in `streamlit.py`. Modifying the API call may disrupt this integration.
- **Tool Use**: The demo supports tools like `computer_20250124`, requiring the beta header `"anthropic-beta: computer-use-2025-01-24"`. Ensure this is included in API calls.
- **Community Feedback**: No specific streaming issues were found in the repository’s issues ([Issues](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/issues)), but general setup problems (e.g., port access) suggest thorough environment checks.
- **Documentation Gaps**: The demo’s README lacks explicit streaming instructions, but the [Anthropic Streaming Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) provides clear guidance on using `client.messages.stream()`.

#### Conclusion
Research suggests that the Anthropic Quickstart computer_use_demo supports streaming through its Streamlit interface, likely using `client.beta.messages.with_raw_response.create` to parse SSE events manually. Errors when setting `stream=True` likely stem from incompatible modifications, such as using `stream=True` with `with_raw_response` or failing to handle stream objects. Running the demo unmodified should enable streaming in the UI, while explicit streaming requires updating `loop.py` to use `client.messages.stream()`, as provided in the artifact. Thorough testing and error logging will help resolve remaining issues, ensuring a functional implementation for Claude DC.
