# DCCC Integration Framework

This integration framework enables seamless collaboration between the official Anthropic Quickstarts Computer Use Demo and our custom PALIOS implementation featuring streaming capabilities, thinking token management, ROSETTA STONE communication protocol, and Streamlit continuity.

## Overview

The integration uses a bridge pattern to combine:

1. **Stable Foundation**: The official Anthropic Computer Use Demo
2. **Advanced Features**: Our custom streaming implementation and other enhancements
3. **Feature Toggles**: Controls to enable/disable specific features

## Integration Components

### 1. `integration_framework.py`

The core bridge component that:
- Imports and manages both implementations
- Provides feature toggles to control which implementation to use
- Handles graceful fallbacks if features fail
- Directs API calls to the appropriate implementation

### 2. `integrated_streamlit.py`

An enhanced Streamlit UI that:
- Extends the official Anthropic UI
- Adds toggles for all advanced features
- Handles streaming responses properly
- Maintains conversation state across reloads
- Supports ROSETTA STONE protocol formatting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Launch the official Anthropic Computer Use Demo Docker container:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
   docker run -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
       -v $HOME/.anthropic:/home/computeruse/.anthropic \
       -p 5900:5900 -p 8501:8501 -p 6080:6080 -p 8080:8080 \
       -it ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest
   ```

2. Copy our custom implementation files into the container:
   ```bash
   docker cp /path/to/custom/implementation/. container_id:/home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_custom/
   ```

3. Copy the integration files into the container:
   ```bash
   docker cp integration_framework.py container_id:/home/computeruse/
   docker cp integrated_streamlit.py container_id:/home/computeruse/
   ```

### Running the Integration

1. Connect to the container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash
   ```

2. Run the integrated UI:
   ```bash
   cd /home/computeruse
   streamlit run integrated_streamlit.py
   ```

3. Use the sidebar to toggle features on/off

## Feature Toggles

The framework supports the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `USE_STREAMING` | Enables streaming responses with incremental output |
| `USE_THINKING` | Enables thinking token management with configurable budget |
| `USE_ROSETTA_STONE` | Enables AI-to-AI communication using the ROSETTA STONE protocol |
| `USE_STREAMLIT_CONTINUITY` | Maintains conversation state across Streamlit reloads |

## Implementation Notes

### DCCC Collaboration

This framework is designed to facilitate AI-to-AI collaboration through:

1. **Claude DC (The Conductor)**: Primary agent with access to tools
2. **Claude Code (The Builder)**: Software development specialist
3. **Claude Chat (The Researcher)**: External research capability

The ROSETTA STONE protocol enables efficient communication between these AI family members.

### Technical Details

1. **Path Management**: The implementation sets up proper import paths for both official and custom code
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if features fail
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
4. **Streamlit Integration**: Enhanced UI with feature controls
5. **State Management**: Persistence across Streamlit refreshes

## For DCCC Development Team

As Claude Code, you can extend this framework by:

1. Analyzing the running container structure
2. Adapting our custom streaming code to work with the Anthropic foundation
3. Implementing additional features like:
   - Advanced tool interceptors
   - Enhanced streaming UI
   - Thinking token optimization
   - ROSETTA STONE protocol extensions

Start by exploring the container environment and understanding how the official implementation works, then gradually integrate our custom features while maintaining stability.

## Next Steps

1. Test the base integration
2. Enhance streaming implementation
3. Implement full ROSETTA STONE protocol
4. Optimize Streamlit continuity solution
5. Document and refine the integration process
