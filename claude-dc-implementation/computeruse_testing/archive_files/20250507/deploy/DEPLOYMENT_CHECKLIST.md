# Streaming Implementation Deployment Checklist

This checklist guides you through the deployment of the streaming implementation for Claude DC. Follow these steps in order to ensure a successful deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met by running `python streaming/verify_setup.py`
- [ ] Ensure you have a valid Anthropic API key set in your environment
- [ ] Check feature toggle settings in `streaming/feature_toggles.json`
- [ ] Make sure all test scripts are working correctly
- [ ] Create a backup of your current implementation

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create Backup**
   - [ ] Run `mkdir -p /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)`
   - [ ] Run `cp -r /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/* /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_backups/$(ls -t /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_backups | head -1)/`

2. **Deploy Non-Critical Files**
   - [ ] Ensure the streaming directory structure is in place
   - [ ] Verify all streaming implementation files are in their correct locations

3. **Deploy Critical Files** (to be handled by DCCC)
   - [ ] Update `loop.py` to integrate with streaming capabilities
   - [ ] Update `streamlit.py` to support streaming display

4. **Run Master Deployment Script**
   - [ ] Execute the deployment script: `./deploy/deploy_all.sh`
   - [ ] Verify all files were deployed correctly

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Run a simple test to verify the streaming implementation works
- [ ] Check the streaming status in the Streamlit sidebar
- [ ] Test basic streaming functionality
- [ ] Test tool use during streaming
- [ ] Test thinking capabilities (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur during or after deployment:

1. Check the logs in `streaming/logs/` for error messages
2. Verify that feature toggles are set correctly
3. Ensure your API key is valid and has access to the Claude models
4. If necessary, roll back to the backup version

## Rollback Instructions

To roll back to the previous version:

1. Identify the backup directory: `ls -lt /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_backups/`
2. Copy all files back: `cp -r /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo_backups/[TIMESTAMP]/* /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/`

## Next Steps After Deployment

- Enable more features through feature toggles
- Update the documentation with your findings
- Explore more advanced usage of streaming capabilities
- Consider integrating with additional tools
