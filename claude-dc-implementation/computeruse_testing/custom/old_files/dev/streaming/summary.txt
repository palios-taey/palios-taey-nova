Streaming Implementation Summary

Current Status:
1. We have successfully implemented the streaming bash tool with the following capabilities:
   - Command execution with streaming output
   - Command validation for safety
   - Progress reporting during execution
   - Error handling and recovery

2. We have created a streaming adapter framework:
   - Connects tools to the streaming agent loop
   - Manages tool state during streaming
   - Tracks execution progress
   - Handles multiple concurrent tools

3. Testing:
   - Unit tests for bash streaming tool 
   - Integration tests for adapter interaction
   - Both test suites pass successfully

4. Documentation:
   - README.md with usage instructions
   - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with detailed approach
   - ROADMAP.md with next steps

Next Steps:
1. Implement streaming for file operations
2. Add streaming support for screenshot tool
3. Integrate with the main streaming agent loop
4. Optimize performance for production use

The implementation follows the "YOUR Environment = YOUR Home = YOUR Responsibility" principle:
- All development is in an isolated environment
- Thorough testing before integration
- Clear documentation of APIs and usage
- Careful backup strategy

This implementation provides a foundation for enhancing Claude DC with streaming capabilities, enabling incremental output delivery, progress reporting, and better user experience during tool execution.
