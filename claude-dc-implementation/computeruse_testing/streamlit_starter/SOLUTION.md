# Solution for ImportError: cannot import name 'APIProvider' from 'computer_use_demo.loop'

## Problem Summary

Claude DC was encountering the following error when trying to import from `computer_use_demo.loop`:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'APIProvider' from 'computer_use_demo.loop'
```

This error occurred because the streamlit.py file was importing `APIProvider` and `sampling_loop` from `computer_use_demo.loop`, but these names weren't defined in the current implementation.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The original implementation had these components:
   - In streamlit.py: Imports `APIProvider` and `sampling_loop` from `computer_use_demo.loop`
   - In loop.py: The current implementation is missing these definitions

2. The current implementation provides similar functionality but with different names:
   - agent_loop instead of sampling_loop
   - No APIProvider class defined

## Solution Implemented

To fix this error, we made the following changes to the loop.py file:

1. Added the `APIProvider` enum with the same values as the original:
   ```python
   class APIProvider(StrEnum):
       """Enum for different API providers"""
       ANTHROPIC = "anthropic" 
       BEDROCK = "bedrock"
       VERTEX = "vertex"
   ```

2. Added a `sampling_loop` function that wraps our `agent_loop` function:
   ```python
   async def sampling_loop(
       *,
       system_prompt_suffix: str = "",
       model: str,
       provider: APIProvider = APIProvider.ANTHROPIC,
       messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
       output_callback: Callable[[Any], None],
       # ... other parameters ...
   ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       # Call agent_loop with appropriate parameters
   ```

3. Created a deployment script (deploy.sh) that:
   - Creates a backup of the current environment
   - Copies the updated files to the computer_use_demo directory
   - Installs required dependencies

4. Added comprehensive tests to verify the compatibility:
   - test_api_imports.py: Verifies the APIProvider and sampling_loop imports
   - test_implementation.py: Validates the complete implementation

## Verification

We validated our solution by:

1. Running import tests: Verified that `APIProvider` and `sampling_loop` can be imported
2. Running compatibility tests: Verified that our implementations match the expected interfaces
3. Checking function signatures: Ensured our functions accept the same parameters

## Implementation Approach

This solution follows the Fibonacci Development Pattern by:

1. Starting with minimal changes to make the interface compatible
2. Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code
3. Building on our solid foundation of streaming implementation
4. Testing each component thoroughly before deployment

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy this solution:

1. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. Launch the Streamlit application:
   ```
   cd /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Future Considerations

1. The current solution provides compatibility with the existing API while maintaining the improved functionality of our streaming implementation.

2. For future implementations, consider:
   - Standardizing on a common interface to avoid these compatibility issues
   - Implementing a more robust state persistence mechanism
   - Adding additional tools and capabilities
