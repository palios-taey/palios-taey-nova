# Mouse Operations Adapter Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive mouse operations adapter that supports safe, controlled interaction with the GUI environment. The adapter will provide enhanced functionality for mouse movement, clicks, and drag operations with robust validation, security controls, and error handling.

## Key Operations

The mouse operations adapter will support the following key operations:

1. **Mouse Movement**: Moving the cursor to specific coordinates
2. **Mouse Clicks**: Left, right, middle button clicks
3. **Mouse Drag**: Click, drag, and release operations
4. **Double and Triple Clicks**: For specialized interactions
5. **Scroll Operations**: Vertical and horizontal scrolling

## Security Considerations

The implementation will address several security considerations:

1. **Coordinate Validation**: Ensure coordinates are within screen boundaries
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent too many operations in rapid succession
3. **Sequence Validation**: Ensure operations follow logical sequences
4. **Click Limitations**: Restrict the number of clicks in a given timeframe
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources during operations

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
MouseOperationsAdapter
├── Validation Layer
│   ├── CoordinateValidator
│   ├── RateLimiter
│   └── SequenceValidator
├── Core Operations
│   ├── MouseMovement
│   ├── MouseClick
│   ├── MouseDrag
│   └── MouseScroll
├── Monitoring
│   ├── ResourceMonitor
│   └── OperationLogger
└── Error Handling
    ├── ValidationErrors
    ├── ExecutionErrors
    └── RecoveryMechanisms
```

### Data Flow

1. Client requests mouse operation with parameters
2. Validation layer checks parameters and operation context
3. If validation passes, core operation is executed
4. Monitoring tracks resource usage and logs the operation
5. Error handling manages any failures and provides feedback
6. Results are returned to the client

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Enhanced Mouse Movement

```python
async def dc_mouse_move(coordinates, smooth=True, verify_position=True):
    """
    Move the mouse to specified coordinates with enhanced control.
    
    Args:
        coordinates: [x, y] position to move to
        smooth: Whether to use smooth movement or instant jump
        verify_position: Whether to verify final position matches request
    
    Returns:
        DCToolResult with operation outcome
    """
```

### 2. Enhanced Mouse Click

```python
async def dc_mouse_click(
    button="left", 
    coordinates=None, 
    double_click=False, 
    triple_click=False,
    hold_duration_ms=0
):
    """
    Perform a mouse click operation with enhanced control.
    
    Args:
        button: Which button to click ("left", "right", "middle")
        coordinates: Optional [x, y] position to move before clicking
        double_click: Whether to perform a double-click
        triple_click: Whether to perform a triple-click
        hold_duration_ms: How long to hold the button down (0 for immediate)
    
    Returns:
        DCToolResult with operation outcome
    """
```

### 3. Enhanced Mouse Drag

```python
async def dc_mouse_drag(
    start_coordinates, 
    end_coordinates, 
    button="left",
    steps=10,
    verify_position=True
):
    """
    Perform a mouse drag operation from start to end coordinates.
    
    Args:
        start_coordinates: [x, y] starting position
        end_coordinates: [x, y] ending position
        button: Which button to use for dragging
        steps: Number of intermediate steps (for smooth dragging)
        verify_position: Whether to verify final position
    
    Returns:
        DCToolResult with operation outcome
    """
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Coordinate Validation**
   - Must be a list/tuple of exactly 2 integers
   - X coordinate must be within 0 ≤ x < screen_width
   - Y coordinate must be within 0 ≤ y < screen_height
   - Special coordinates (-1, -1) allowed for "current position"

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Maximum 20 operations per 5-second window
   - Minimum 50ms between clicks
   - Minimum 200ms between complex operations

3. **Button Validation**
   - Only "left", "right", "middle" allowed for button parameter
   - Only specific combinations of parameters allowed

## Error Handling

1. **Validation Errors**
   - Clear error messages for invalid parameters
   - Suggestions for fixing common errors

2. **Execution Errors**
   - Detection of failed operations
   - Recovery mechanisms for common failure patterns
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

3. **Resource Protection**
   - Timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
   - Cancellation of operations that exceed resource limits

## Feature Toggles

The implementation will support several feature toggles:

- `use_mouse_movement`: Enable/disable mouse movement
- `use_mouse_click`: Enable/disable mouse clicking
- `use_mouse_drag`: Enable/disable mouse dragging
- `use_rate_limiting`: Enable/disable operation rate limiting
- `use_position_verification`: Enable/disable position verification

## Integration Points

The mouse operations adapter will integrate with:

1. **Enhanced Bridge**: Through the feature toggle system
2. **Real Tool Adapters**: For production operation execution
3. **Monitoring System**: For tracking resource usage and operation statistics
4. **Error Handling System**: For consistent error reporting and recovery

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each operation individually
   - Test validation logic with valid and invalid inputs
   - Test error handling with simulated failures

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test combinations of mouse operations
   - Test interaction with other tools (screenshot, bash)
   - Test feature toggle behavior

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness
   - Test resource usage during operations
   - Test with varied operation patterns

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Movement**
   - Implement basic mouse movement with validation
   - Add feature toggle for mouse movement
   - Create unit tests for movement

2. **Phase 2: Click Operations**
   - Implement left, right, middle clicks
   - Add double and triple click functionality
   - Add feature toggles for click operations

3. **Phase 3: Drag Operations**
   - Implement drag operations
   - Add smooth movement capability
   - Create integration tests with screenshots

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Add position verification
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Create comprehensive documentation
