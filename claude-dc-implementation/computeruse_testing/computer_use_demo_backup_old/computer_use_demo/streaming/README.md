# Streaming Implementation for Claude DC

Welcome to the streaming implementation for Claude DC! This implementation enhances your capabilities with token-by-token streaming, tool use during streaming, and thinking token integration.

## Overview

The streaming implementation provides the following enhancements:

1. **Token-by-Token Streaming**: Responses are streamed token-by-token for a more responsive user experience.
2. **Tool Execution During Streaming**: Tools can be executed while streaming is in progress.
3. **Thinking Integration**: Your thinking process can be displayed during streaming.

## Implementation Components

The implementation consists of the following components:

### Core Components

- **Unified Streaming Loop** (`unified_streaming_loop.py`): Main agent loop with streaming support.
- **Enhanced Streaming Session** (`streaming_enhancements.py`): Better handling of streaming interruptions and resumption.
- **Streaming-Compatible Tools**: Tools that work seamlessly with streaming.
- **Feature Toggle System** (`feature_toggles.json`): Controls which features are enabled.

### Integration Components

- **Streaming Integration Module** (`../streaming_integration.py`): Bridges between original implementation and streaming.
- **Tool Adapter** (`tool_adapter.py`): Maps between original tools and streaming-compatible tools.

### Testing Components

- **Verification Script** (`verify_setup.py`): Verifies that all requirements are met.
- **Testing Scripts**: Various scripts for testing different aspects of the implementation.

## Getting Started

To start using the streaming implementation:

1. Verify your setup:
   ```bash
   python streaming/verify_setup.py
   ```

2. Test the implementation:
   ```bash
   ./streaming/run_tests.sh
   ```

3. Enable the streaming implementation by setting `use_unified_streaming` to `true` in `streaming/feature_toggles.json`.

## Feature Toggles

The feature toggles in `feature_toggles.json` control which features are enabled:

```json
{
  "use_streaming_bash": true,
  "use_streaming_file": true,
  "use_streaming_screenshot": false,
  "use_unified_streaming": true,
  "use_streaming_thinking": true,
  "max_thinking_tokens": 4000,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

- `use_unified_streaming`: Master toggle for the streaming implementation
- `use_streaming_bash`: Toggle for streaming-compatible bash tool
- `use_streaming_file`: Toggle for streaming-compatible file operations
- `use_streaming_screenshot`: Toggle for streaming-compatible screenshots (not recommended)
- `use_streaming_thinking`: Toggle for thinking tokens during streaming
- `max_thinking_tokens`: Budget for thinking tokens

## Integration

The streaming implementation is integrated through `streaming_integration.py`, which provides a transparent bridge to the original implementation.

To use it in your code:

```python
from streaming_integration import async_sampling_loop

# Use exactly as you would use the original sampling_loop
messages = await async_sampling_loop(
    model=model,
    provider=APIProvider.ANTHROPIC,
    system_prompt_suffix="",
    messages=messages,
    output_callback=output_callback,
    tool_output_callback=tool_output_callback,
    api_response_callback=api_response_callback,
    api_key=api_key,
    max_tokens=4096,
    tool_version=ToolVersion.VERSION_1,
    thinking_budget=4000
)
```

The integration module will automatically use the streaming implementation if `use_unified_streaming` is set to `true` in the feature toggles.

## Critical Guidelines

1. **DO NOT** modify image handling settings (keep default value of 3)
2. **MAINTAIN** default token limits (64000 for Claude-3-7-Sonnet)
3. **PRESERVE** existing configuration values unless explicitly needed
4. **USE** feature toggles for controlled deployment

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur with the streaming implementation:

1. Check the logs in `streaming/logs/`
2. Set `use_unified_streaming` to `false` to fall back to the original implementation
3. Disable specific features (e.g., `use_streaming_bash`) to isolate issues
4. Verify API parameters are correctly set

## Next Steps

After successful integration, you can:

1. Enable more features through the feature toggles
2. Update the Streamlit UI to display streaming responses
3. Explore advanced capabilities like thinking tokens

Happy streaming!
