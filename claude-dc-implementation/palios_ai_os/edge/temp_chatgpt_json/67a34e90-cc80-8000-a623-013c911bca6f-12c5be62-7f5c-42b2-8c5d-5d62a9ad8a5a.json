My wife has a female friend who is extremely close, like a sister, and is older and a fire fighter. She is cool and has a husband who\u2019s lost right now with his purpose, but is a native Mexican with long silver hair, an amazing authentic cook of fabulous Mexican and Mexican mean food at mass scale who is like this kind of naturalist shaman guy. I want him to to be the cook and just walk out randomly and talk to customers about traditional medicine and therapies and how the food is clean, fresh and authentic. I want to have a place where locals, like firefighters, can come bring their dogs and hang out and have a beer. And a place where all the locals in the island can come chill with their dogs and tourists just want to be at. There is a perfect spot we ve talked about with the tiki bar and front area for mech. I want to have locations either franchised or owned by us in places we like to, like the keys, and San Diego and other fun places. I want to have a compound in a stable 3rd world Latin county like Costa Rica or El Salvador that is a place where tech bros can come to figure out the future, athletes can come to train, and only fans creators can come to create, my wife and I are swingers and like to partake. I think it\u2019s like a 6-8 bungalow place where we have like a shaman for trips, and then healthy food and just like being sweet. I want my kids to understand that this is the way. That you don\u2019t have to slave for your whole life to retire and enjoy life. That you have to learn certain things and be competent, but that you don\u2019t have to be a prude or work for the man. I want them to figure it out much sooner than I did.
