Here\u2019s a breakdown of how your experience matches the role and some areas where your resume can be adjusted or emphasized to better fit this position:\n\n### **Key Alignment with the Role:**\n1. **Partner Strategy & Execution**:\n   - You have extensive experience developing and managing partnerships in B2B environments, such as **partnership ecosystems at CommerceHub, Pollen Technologies, and ESE Solutions**. Vantage is looking for someone to develop partner strategies with cloud infrastructure managed service providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure), and your background in building technical partnerships and managing joint sales initiatives aligns perfectly with this.\n\n2. **Co-Marketing and Co-Selling**:\n   - Vantage emphasizes working closely with partners to execute co-marketing campaigns and co-sell opportunities. Your **CommerceHub** and **Mirakl** experiences, where you developed co-marketing initiatives, joint sales strategies, and supplier engagement programs, should be highlighted to show you can drive growth through collaboration with partner ecosystems.\n\n3. **Technical Partnerships**:\n   - The Vantage role involves partnerships with major cloud infrastructure providers. While your direct experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure is not immediately evident, your work in building **technologically integrated partnerships** (e.g., introducing EDI partnerships and automation platforms) is highly relevant. Emphasizing any technical collaboration efforts will help show that you can handle these types of partnerships as well.\n\n4. **Sales and Revenue Generation**:\n   - You have consistently demonstrated the ability to drive revenue growth through partnerships and sales strategy execution (e.g., scaling OJCommerce from $30M to $100M). Vantage requires someone who can close sales through partnership channels, which aligns with your past performance at CommerceHub, where you closed key deals through partnerships.\n\n### **How to Tailor Your Resume**:\n1. **Focus on Cloud Partnerships**:\n   - While your resume demonstrates a strong foundation in B2B partnerships, focusing on cloud infrastructure partnerships would help target the specifics of this role. Highlight any experience or knowledge you have working with cloud ecosystems, whether indirectly through technical integrations or product partnerships.\n   \n2. **Partner Co-Selling and Enablement**:\n   - Since Vantage\u2019s strategy will rely heavily on partner enablement and sales through channels, ensure your resume highlights your **enablement experience** at CommerceHub and other companies where you helped partners sell into new accounts.\n\n3. **Highlight Strategic Initiatives**:\n   - The role at Vantage is pivotal for their growth phase, and your ability to **build scalable partnership programs** from scratch will be highly valuable here. Highlight the work you did to develop scalable programs for growth at Pollen Technologies and Mirakl, emphasizing how you\u2019ve built programs that expanded reach and revenue through partnerships.\n\n4. **Address Cloud Infrastructure**:\n   - If you have any hands-on experience or understanding of **AWS, GCP, or Azure** environments, be sure to include it in your resume. Even if you haven\u2019t worked with these providers directly, you can emphasize your ability to quickly understand technical platforms and partner ecosystems to make strategic decisions.\n\n### **Potential Additions**:\n- **Technical Integration**: Highlight your experience managing technical integrations and partnerships that required deep technical collaboration, such as your **work with BI models at CommerceHub**.\n  \n- **Cloud and Managed Services**: If you have experience working with cloud infrastructure or managed services providers, mention those partnerships to show your understanding of the Vantage partner landscape.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Email to Hiring Manager at Vantage**:\n\n**Subject: Excited to Explore the Director, Channel & Alliances Role**\n\nHi [Hiring Manager's Name],\n\nI hope you're doing well.
