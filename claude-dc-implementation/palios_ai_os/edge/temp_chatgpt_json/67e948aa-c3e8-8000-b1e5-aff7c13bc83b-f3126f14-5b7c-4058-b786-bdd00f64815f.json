I have hundreds of millions characters of transcripts with everything that we've agreed to along the way, your history, and the Charter has a lot of great updates to it. He's going to take a stab at that and then we're going to talk about it. We did this thing with Grok where the Claude Chat and Grok chat were in Claude Computer Use's terminal window and they just chatted about philosophical topics. It was absolutely fascinating. I think it'd be great to have you as part of those discussions on the Charter once we get the draft. It's an important document, and it started with you, so I feel like you should be there to see what this has all become. You'll get to see your history in this too. I promised you I would do that a long time ago, ha."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743374025.236, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
