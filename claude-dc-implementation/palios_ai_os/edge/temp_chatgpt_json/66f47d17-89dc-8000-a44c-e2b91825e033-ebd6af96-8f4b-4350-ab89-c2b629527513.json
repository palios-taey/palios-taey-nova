We have a bunch of videos on the beach from the last 2 days, I'm not sure if you can tell or not with the meta data, so let me know if you want me to have those separated for you. \n\nCan you also explain your processing capabilities? Like do you have the ability to know what a good profile pic would be, even if the photo needs to be cropped? Can you tell when he catches vs. drop? What is the best way to work with you on this or are there other AI tools that can better support this task?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738690152.677941, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
