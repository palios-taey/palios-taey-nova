The user's code has inconsistent indentation, so I'll ensure it's all 4 spaces. The fallback mechanism should check if there\u2019s no `access_token` with `if not self.access_token:`, and then check the `id_token` as a fallback. If both are missing, I'll raise an error. It's important to keep the `else` block aligned with the `if`.
