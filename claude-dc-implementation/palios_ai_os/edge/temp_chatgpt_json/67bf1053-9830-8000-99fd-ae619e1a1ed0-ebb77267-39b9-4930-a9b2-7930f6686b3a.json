In other words, that role isn\u2019t assignable directly to the service account using the gcloud command as attempted.\n\n### What to Do Next\n\n1. **Check API Enablement:**  \n   First, ensure that the Gemini Pro (Generative Language) API is enabled in your Google Cloud project. In the Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > Dashboard** and confirm that the API is listed and enabled.\n\n2. **Service Account Permissions:**  \n   For accessing the API via OAuth 2.0, your service account primarily needs to be able to generate tokens. The **Service Account Token Creator** role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) is essential and you've already assigned it successfully.\n\n3. **No Additional Role Needed on the Service Account:**  \n   In many cases with Google Cloud APIs, if the API is enabled for your project and you use the proper authentication (using default credentials or via the service account), no extra \u201cAPI User\u201d role needs to be bound directly to the service account. The API will grant access based on the project\u2019s enabled APIs and your token's scopes.\n\n4. **Verify Scopes and API Enablement:**  \n   Ensure that your service account\u2019s JSON key is from a service account that has the necessary IAM permissions on the project level. In your code, you are requesting the scopes:\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative.language`\n   \n   These scopes should be sufficient if the API is enabled. You don\u2019t need to bind the `roles/generativeLanguage.user` role to your service account if it\u2019s not supported.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Enable the API:** Make sure the Gemini Pro (Generative Language) API is enabled in your project.\n- **Service Account Role:** You already have `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` assigned. That should be enough to generate the OAuth token.\n- **No Need for roles/generativeLanguage.user:** Since that role cannot be bound to the service account, rely on project-level API enablement and proper scopes.\n\n### Next Steps for You\n\n- Confirm that the Generative Language API is enabled in your project.\n- Rely on the default credentials flow (as implemented in our updated code) with the scopes provided.\n- Ensure that you have set the environment variable **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** to point to your service account JSON key.\n- Test the integration again.\n\nThis setup\u2014using the default credentials with the correct scopes and ensuring the API is enabled\u2014should be sufficient for accessing the Gemini Pro API.\n\nDoes this clarify the next steps regarding service account roles and permissions?
