Tech support said \u201cthis is a known issue,\u201d put me on hold for ~10 minutes and hung up. Turned out I was one of the 12,000 people impacted by Google\u2019s layoffs. This was not the plan. I have two daughters and a wife to support. Friday was not a good day.\r\n\r\nAfter taking the weekend to breathe, I started feeling very differently: Google is a unique place, and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to have worked there. First, I worked with some amazing people - bright, collaborative, reflective, *giving* people. Second, I learned a ton about online ads, regulatory compliance and how to solve planet-scale ML problems. Third, I was treated generously by everyone at the firm, in the full sense of the word, including on Friday. Especially on Friday. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m also excited about the future. There will be some incredible AI products built over the next few years, from mundane to civilization-changing. It is a great time to be an AI product manager. There is so much to do!\r\n\r\nIf you know of a company in the space that may be looking, or that I should meet, or if you would like to chat about another topic, please tag or DM me. If your company is not hiring for this type of role, I\u2019d appreciate it if you engage in this post for more visibility (like, comment, or share!). And as usual, if there is something I can do to support you, please let me know as well.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nhashtag#google hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#career hashtag#layoffs hashtag#ai hashtag#ml \r\nlikesupportlove\r\n3,323\r\n153 comments\r\nPost\r\nPost\r\nThe Finance revolution has touched every market, firm, and department \u2014 except product distribution.
