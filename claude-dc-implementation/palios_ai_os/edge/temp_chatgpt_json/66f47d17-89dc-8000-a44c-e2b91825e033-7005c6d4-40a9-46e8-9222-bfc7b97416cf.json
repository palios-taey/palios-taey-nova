Finalize Your Edits**\n- Make sure all your text, captions, and any effects are in place.\n- Preview the video to confirm everything looks good.\n\n### **2. Export Settings**\n1. **Tap the Export Button** (usually in the top-right corner, labeled as an **\"arrow up\" icon or \"Export\"**).\n2. **Choose Resolution & FPS:**\n   - **Resolution**: Set to **1080p** for the best balance between quality and file size (or **4K** if you need ultra-high quality).\n   - **Frame Rate**: **30 FPS** is standard for social media, but **60 FPS** is good if you want a smoother look.\n   - **Bitrate**: Leave it on **automatic** unless you need high-quality exports.\n\n### **3. Remove Watermark (if necessary)**\n- If using the free version of CapCut, it may add a watermark. You can manually crop it out or use a premium version.\n\n### **4. Save & Share**\n- After exporting, save it to your phone or **directly upload it** to **TikTok, Instagram, X, YouTube Shorts, or Facebook Reels** from CapCut.\n- If you want to review before posting, upload it to **Google Drive** or **iCloud** for easy access across devices.\n\nLet me know if you need help with a **specific setting** or if you\u2019re experiencing an issue! \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738716617.765017, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
