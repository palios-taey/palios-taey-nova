I am providing some additional insight into the role and how it relates to Lily AI and then providing 2 resume versions to use as a starting point for revisions. \n\nFor OJCommerce, I'd like to focus on vendor onboarding, which is very similar to sales except we aren't receiving payment from them, but the process is the same, identifying targets, scoring targets, conducting outreach, communicating a value proposition, getting to the decision maker, negotiating pricing and contract terms and ultimately closing the deal and securing the relationship. I'd also like to focus on product data, SKU additions and feature mapping efforts, category expansion. And the development of AI/ML algorithms. Some of these are already in there, but I'll expand on them below. You can adjust organization, but the length needs to be somewhere in the middle of the 2 examples\n\nVendor onboarding. Overall, this was the primary driver of growth from $30-100mil in 3 years with no marketing spend. I think it might make sense to have this in a section with that as the opening line with like \"by implementing the following\" which would then have everything bulleted.  Led development of AI/ML algorithm to score targets based on aggregated reviews and retail price across the channels OJ sold on. It was trained by looking at the current vendor base's performance for OJ based on the same process. This led to more efficient allocation of tight resources. Next, I completely revamped the sales engagement process. We utilized the list and then bounced that off lists of trade shows, because these are companies large enough to support a presence at a show and are actively seeking new relationships. The process was outreach with a pitch 1 month prior to the show to see if we could secure engagement and begin the onboarding process. For those that were non-responsive, we'd visit in person and review the pitch with them at the show based on their priority. This was an ongoing effort. I implemented a highly automated process which enabled us to manage a very high volume of targets at the top of the funnel and developed a two-tier system of engagement, one for lower scores, which were essentially self service and required minimal personal engagement from the selling team and driven mainly by technology and the back office team in India. This enable us to consistently add long tail partners while enabling the higher-skilled US based buying team to focus on personalized outreach and sales calls to high scoring targets. I also revamped the contracting process to significantly reduce the friction and back and forth which is detailed below. \n\nOn the product side, I led category expansion initiatives giving me familiarity with the product requirements of several verticals. I implemented a number of AI/ML initiatives here to automate the category mapping, feature mapping and attribute mapping of various verticles to the marketplaces which we sold on. For example, color mapping to standard colors was a challenge and we implemented an algorithm that would learn based on the results that came back from matching at the marketplace sites. This and other mapping initiatives were a major enabler of the rapid and accurate expansion of SKU count. \n\nOn the data side, the 2 major AI/ML initiatives were the pricing algorithm which is in the info below and the compliance program. I led the development of an AI/ML algorithm that utilized existing data to train and provide proactive warnings when metrics were moving in a way that would raise concern, in effect, we were able to very accurately predict when an issue was about to occur so we could stop it before it had a major impact on our metrics, which led to the improvement below without reducing sales because it was so accurate and targeted. \n\nExamples\nLed a newly established drop ship division, driving rapid growth and scaling operations.
