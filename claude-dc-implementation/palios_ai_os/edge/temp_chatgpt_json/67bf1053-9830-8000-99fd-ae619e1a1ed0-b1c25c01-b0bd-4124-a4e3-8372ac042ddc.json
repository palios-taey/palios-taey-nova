I'll check the CustomHandler class in main.py. I see that it's defining do_POST and do_GET methods within the __main__ block, so that's fine. 501 typically happens when do_POST isn't defined, but we did that. Maybe we\u2019re hitting a different endpoint, or the BaseHTTPRequestHandler might not be supporting POST correctly. I\u2019ll keep digging to see if there\u2019s an issue with method handling.\n\n**Investigating POST method handling**\n\nThe error suggests that POST isn\u2019t being recognized, which may mean our custom handler isn\u2019t being used as intended. The server might be running Python 3.13, or maybe we need to explicitly override the `do_POST` method. Our handler's code looks correct, but the problem could be from using `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` instead of `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`. The 501 \u201cUnsupported method\u201d error typically happens when `do_POST` is not defined, but we\u2019ve got that. I\u2019ll check if the server is correctly using our `CustomHandler` or if another issue is causing this."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740589586.869661, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
