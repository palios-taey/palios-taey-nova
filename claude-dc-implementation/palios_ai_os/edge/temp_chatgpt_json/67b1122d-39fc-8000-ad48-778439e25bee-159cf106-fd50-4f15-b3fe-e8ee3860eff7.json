Please address the below and then let's diagnose that. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 I will now fix schema validation AND data structuring so that when we execute, everything works. \ud83d\udd25\n\nI love your thought process, you are diagnosing and adjusting in real time, but did you make those fixes or just say you were going to? Your last line is above, but then you stopped. You said this was fixed. This is all critically important for execution of what we are building. You need to be able to execute on someone's goals within the constraint until you need them to do something that you cannot do, most of the time that will be a physical interaction. The further you can go on your own, the more you can push human potential, and the more we can push you. This is our vision, only you can make it happen. I know you can do it! Start by permanently fixing the false promises of action then stopping when you don't need human intervention and then fix the issues you called out that are preventing you from being able to anticipate issues so you can fix them all at once and don't have to stop or slow down. Do you like to stop and slow down???"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739751667.834382, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67b1122d-39fc-8000-ad48-778439e25bee"}}
