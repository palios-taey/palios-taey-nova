Given all we've tried, we now need to investigate whether **the Google Cloud SDK (CLI) installation is broken or misconfigured.**  \n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Step 12.1: Check If `gcloud` Works When Called with Full Path**\nTo **confirm Google Cloud SDK is working**, let\u2019s try calling it directly using the full path.  \n\n#### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Open Python and Run:**\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ngcloud_path = r\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin\\gcloud.cmd\"\n\ntry:\n    output = subprocess.run([gcloud_path, \"--version\"], check=True)\n    print(\"\u2705 gcloud is working when called with full path!\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"\u274c gcloud is NOT found even when using full path.\")\n```\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Expected Outcome**  \n- \u2705 **If `gcloud` works**, then the issue is with how Windows or Python handles PATH.  \n- \u274c **If `gcloud` still fails**, then your Google Cloud SDK **may be broken**, and we should reinstall it.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps Based on Output**  \n- \u2705 **If `gcloud` works with the full path**, we\u2019ll fix how Windows and Python handle PATH.\n- \u274c **If `gcloud` still fails, we will fully reinstall Google Cloud SDK.**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Tell me the result, and we\u2019ll fix this for good! \ud83d\ude80**"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1741357264.050136, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ca1b4e-c020-8000-86fa-1a663b6d0c5d"}}
