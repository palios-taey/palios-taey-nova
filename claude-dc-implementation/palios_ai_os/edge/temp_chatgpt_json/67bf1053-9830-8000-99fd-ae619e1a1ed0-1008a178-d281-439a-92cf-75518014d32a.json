I'll check Google documentation for \"Gemini Pro API service account roles,\" though it might not be listed directly. It might be part of Google\u2019s Generative Language API, and the \"Generative Language API User\" role could be recommended. I'll search with my internal knowledge, and it seems \"roles/generativeLanguage.user\" might be the correct role, based on my findings.\n\n**Confirming service account roles**\n\nI remember that for some Google APIs, the service account needs roles like \"Cloud AI Platform User\" or \"Generative Language API User.\" The correct API URL is \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com,\" which aligns with the Generative Language API. After looking deeper, it seems the role \"roles/generativeLanguage.user\" is the correct one. For token creation, \"roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator\" may be needed too. So, the final roles could be \"roles/generativeLanguage.user\" and \"roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator,\" depending on your needs."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740594213.62564, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
