Throughout my career, I have honed my ability to drive revenue growth through streamlined processes, data-driven decision-making, and cross-functional leadership\u2014skills that align perfectly with the responsibilities outlined in this role.\n\nIn my most recent role as Consultant of Sales and Partnerships at Pollen Technologies, I built a comprehensive CRM system from scratch, automated revenue-driving workflows, and optimized the CPQ process to reduce cycle times by 50%, resulting in significant improvements in deal velocity and accuracy. Similarly, at Mirakl, I led a $100M+ business initiative by implementing a competitive pricing strategy and collaborating across departments to secure board-level approval. This experience allowed me to build scalable, data-driven strategies that increased operational efficiency while aligning stakeholders around key revenue goals.\n\nI have deep experience with CRM systems like Salesforce and Hubspot, as well as marketing automation tools, which I leveraged to streamline sales, marketing, and customer success processes. Additionally, I have a proven track record of building high-performing teams and developing dashboards that provide actionable insights to boost performance across the revenue lifecycle.\n\nI am confident that my strategic approach, technical knowledge, and ability to drive cross-functional collaboration would make me an asset to Formant\u2019s mission of helping companies manage and scale their robot fleets. I am particularly inspired by Formant\u2019s innovative culture and its commitment to placing humans at the center of the autonomous future, and I am eager to contribute to that vision.\n\nThank you for considering my application.
