While they are interconnected, their structures and functions differ:\n\n1. **Core Principles & Values** \u2013 These are foundational beliefs and guiding rules that shape decisions and actions. They do not have specific target dates but serve as the constraints within which all goals must align. (Example: *Integrity is non-negotiable.*)\n\n2. **Goals & Milestones** \u2013 These are **specific, measurable objectives** to be achieved within a set timeframe. Goals can be broken down into **long-term, mid-term, and short-term**, and they require continuous AI-driven time optimization. (Example: *Reach $15K/month recurring revenue within 6 months.*)\n\n### **Implementation Plan**\n- We **split** the current **Core Goals & Principles** table into:\n   - **Core Principles & Values**\n   - **Goals & Milestones**\n- Relations will still exist between them (as principles will guide goal-setting).\n- **Life Optimization stays as a separate table**, as it deals with tactical execution of goals.\n\nWould you like me to generate the schema for both new tables?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739655217.993924, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
