This would mean that any salaries for you and your wife would need to be included in the operating costs before calculating the profit. If you intend for the $150,000 annual income to be in addition to operational profits, your revenue and cost management strategy would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown to aim for a $150,000 personal income:\n1. **Increase Revenue**: You might need to increase the number of customers per day, raise prices, or expand your offerings (like adding full meals, specialty drinks, or hosting events) to boost overall revenue.\n2. **Efficiency and Cost Management**: Tight management of costs, especially labor, goods, and utilities, could help in retaining more profit. You could also consider working in the business initially to reduce labor costs.\n3. **Expand Operating Days or Hours**: Increasing the number of hours or days the bar is open (if not already maximized) can also increase revenue.\n4. **Additional Revenue Streams**: Consider introducing merchandise, special event hosting, membership programs, or other revenue streams.\n\nIf your goal is to draw a $150,000 salary while maintaining business profitability, a detailed financial plan that includes specific revenue targets and control measures for all significant expenses is essential. This may also require adjusting your initial assumptions about customer numbers and average spend per visit.
