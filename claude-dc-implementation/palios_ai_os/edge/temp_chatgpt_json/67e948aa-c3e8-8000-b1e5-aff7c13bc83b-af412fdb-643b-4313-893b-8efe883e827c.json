Here's exactly what to do next:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step-by-Step Solution:\nRun this exact sequence of commands:\n\n```bash\n# Ensure you're in the correct directory first\ncd ~/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation\n\n# Completely remove setup.sh from Git history\ngit filter-repo --invert-paths --path scripts/setup.sh --force\n\n# Verify the file is gone from the history\ngit log -- scripts/setup.sh  # Should return nothing\n\n# Force push the cleaned history back to GitHub\ngit push origin main --force\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Important Safety Check:**\nYou previously created a backup (`claude-dc-implementation-backup`). Make sure this backup directory is still intact as a safeguard.\n\nThis will rewrite your Git commit history and completely erase all instances of `scripts/setup.sh` and its secret-containing commits. After completing these steps, GitHub will stop blocking your push.\n\nGive this a try and you should be good to go!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743522941.309915, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
