I have 2 connections in particular that could open a lot of doors, Tweezerman and Leonard Greene. I believe that we could work with Leonard Green based on a connection there to get into their relevant retail brands. Also, I have a close relationship with the VP of Sales at Tweezerman. Perhaps if we offered them the solution as a PoV trial and waived their fees for introductions to their retailer partners. I think we can include their retialers and those of Leonard Green as well. This should be the first point of the plan to leverage existing relationships including the 2 strategic ones with some of their retail brands listed. You can summarize and don't have to list them all, like x in this sector including... So, connections and frame out idea of the 2 strategic ones. Tweezerman for free because they don't have a lot of SKUs which would be low cost for Lily in exchange for intros. This could also be a pilot to see if this could be effective to expand this approach to other brands with large retail customer bases in target industries. And Leonard Green for perhaps a bundled approach because they do centralized procurement and I know the SVP procurement. \n\n2nd bullet will be cold emails/calls, research, please frame this out. 3rd will be partnerships. These should be referral/comarketing partnerships, 4th LinkedIn engagement using my in depth knowledge of managing large catalogs and networks as value added content, 5th, marketing initiative with webinar with someone like Rick Watson.
