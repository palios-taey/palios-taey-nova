I think AI can teach him what he learns in school in a fraction of the time and I think that he could train for football a lot more and learn more and have a much better life if he was homeschooled by ai. I would like to put a plan together for over summer where we spend 2 hours a day on core subjects, one hour on electives which are leveraging ai to start a business and social media with the goal that he can pass tests to place out of his freshman year classes. He learns nothing in school now because it\u2019s so inefficient and chaotic and think that would work better for him. Do you think that\u2019s possible?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739152387.862008, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
