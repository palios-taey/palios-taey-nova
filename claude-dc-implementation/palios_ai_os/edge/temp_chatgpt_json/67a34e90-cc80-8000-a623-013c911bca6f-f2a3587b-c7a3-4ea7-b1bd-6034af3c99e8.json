It\u2019s been a long time\u2014I think the last time we connected was back ~15 years ago at BLTW. I\u2019ve seen some of your posts over the years, and it\u2019s awesome to see the impact you\u2019ve made in HR and with the alumni network.\r\n\r\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and honestly, a little uncomfortable).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it\u2019s been brutal. AI is completely upending the job market, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.\r\n\r\nSo tomorrow morning, I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment on LinkedIn, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nA reshare, comment, or even just a like would help get it in front of the right people\u2014and if anyone in your network might be able to help, that would mean the world.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out! Would love to get your thoughts on it as well since it's in your wheelhouse. \r\n\r\nAppreciate it, Jeff. Thanks for your support.\r\n\r\nIn Hoc,\r\nJesse"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739213204.093562, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
