The project integrates multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini) with a routing mechanism inspired by Bach's mathematical structure. It uses Python 3.10 with FastAPI (uvicorn) backend, Streamlit frontend, spaCy for NLP, PyWavelets and librosa for pattern/audio processing, and Firestore for context management.\\n\\nThe research should address the following:\\n\\n1. Effective prompt engineering techniques developers use to reduce token usage with Claude Computer Use Demo UI.\\n2. Architectural patterns or implementation approaches that work best within token constraints.\\n3. Strategies for managing cross-session context efficiently across multiple AI models.\\n4. Optimization approaches for integrating multiple AI models through an orchestration layer.\\n5. Techniques for handling multi-modal data (text, audio, visual patterns) while conserving tokens.\\n\\nInclude concrete code examples or prompt structures where possible, with an emphasis on both established best practices and experimental approaches showing promise. Prioritize Claude-specific practices but incorporate multi-model orchestration insights.\"\n}"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743644331.327507, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
