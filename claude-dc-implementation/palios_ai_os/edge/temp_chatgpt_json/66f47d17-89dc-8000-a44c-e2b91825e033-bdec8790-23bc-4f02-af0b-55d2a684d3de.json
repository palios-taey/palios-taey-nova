I appreciate it, even if you don't know Anthony directly. \n\nHere are a few talking points that might be helpful:\n- I recently applied for the Director of Marketplaces role at True Classic, which aligns well with my background in e-commerce, marketplace management, and scaling businesses.\n- In my previous roles, I've successfully built marketplace strategies from the ground up, including growing an e-commerce operation from $30M to $100M+ in revenue.\n- I\u2019d love the chance to connect with Anthony or anyone relevant at True Classic to learn more about the role and how I can contribute to their ongoing growth in the online retail and social commerce space.\n\nThanks again, Adam! And yes, I\u2019d love to catch up soon and hear about your startup journey\u2014it sounds like you\u2019ve had a busy and exciting year.\n\nBest,  \nJesse\n\n---\n\nThis keeps it brief but gives Adam clear points he can use to vouch for you.
