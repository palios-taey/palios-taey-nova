For a new franchise in a high-growth area like Boca Raton, this data is promising but still reflects a range of outcomes.\n\n3. **Growth Over Time**:\n   - There has been gradual revenue growth from 2021 to 2023 across all quartiles, which may signal increasing brand strength or improving operational efficiencies.\n\n4. **Considerations for Projections**:\n   - While these historical figures provide insight, actual results will depend on your specific territory, marketing strategy, and operational approach.\n\nThis summary highlights the financial variability and the opportunity potential with the Pet Wants franchise, particularly for strong-performing locations.
