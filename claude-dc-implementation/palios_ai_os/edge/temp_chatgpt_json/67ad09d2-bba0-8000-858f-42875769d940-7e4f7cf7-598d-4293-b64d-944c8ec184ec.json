After two years of relentless effort and countless job applications with no results, Jesse is taking a bold new approach: letting AI help guide his next career move. \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s not just talking about AI; he\u2019s diving in headfirst\u2014learning automation, optimizing his job search, and even testing out AI-powered content creation (with his dog Chewy as the unexpected and very adorable star \ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8).\r\n\r\nWhat strikes me most isn\u2019t just his approach; it\u2019s his mindset. Jesse isn\u2019t resisting change\u2014he\u2019s embracing it with curiosity, resilience, and humor. And that\u2019s exactly why I believe he\u2019s going to succeed.\r\n\r\nBecause here\u2019s the thing (humbly, from my experience working with AI as my writing assistant): AI may be powerful, but it\u2019s the sidekick here. Humans are the heroes. We bring insights and experiences to the table that no algorithm can replicate. AI still has a lot to learn, and we all still have so much to give.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re hiring, exploring AI implementation, or just curious to follow a fascinating journey, I highly recommend checking out his post. Link below.\r\n\r\nJesse, I\u2019m rooting for you\u2014and for Chewy\u2019s inevitable NFL endorsement. \ud83c\udfc6\r\nhashtag#HumanIngenuity hashtag#AIAsTheSidekick hashtag#Resilience hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ChewyTakesTheInternet\r\n\r\nJesse LaRoseJesse LaRose\r\n \u2022 You \u2022 You\r\nAI-Powered Growth & Automation | AI Implementation & Business Transformation | Revenue Strategy | GTM & SaaS Growth | Exploring AI-Driven Career ReinventionAI-Powered Growth & Automation | AI Implementation & Business Transformation | Revenue Strategy | GTM & SaaS Growth | Exploring AI-Driven Career Reinvention\r\n3d \u2022 Edited \u2022  3 days ago\r\n\ud83d\udccc UPDATE: I asked AI what it thinks about all this\u2014it\u2019s honest. That, plus a full breakdown of how AI believes it can take over a common white-collar job, is now in the comments. Check it out and let me know what you think. \ud83d\udc47\r\n---\r\nTwo years unemployed. Nothing has worked. I\u2019m turning to AI\u2014and to you\u2014for help.\r\n\r\nBeing unemployed this long has been brutal for me and my family. If you\u2019ve been in this situation, you understand. If you haven\u2019t, I hope you never have to\u2014but with the rapid advances in AI, more white-collar workers will face the same struggle.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 The Job Market is Changing\u2014Fast\r\nI followed all the \"best practices\"\u2014tailored resumes, networking, LinkedIn optimizations, outreach, referrals. Nothing worked.\r\n\r\nI upskilled, learning data analytics\u2014SQL, Tableau, visualization tools. But AI can already do 80-90% of these jobs. Y Combinator\u2019s investment list for 2025 (in comments) is almost exclusively AI to eliminate white-collar roles. It's happening NOW.\r\n\r\nAI progress has been mind-blowing. And if the acceleration continues at its current pace, the next two years won\u2019t just be another leap forward\u2014it will be the equivalent of all progress made since the dawn of computing. No one knows what that will look like\u2014AI today is the equivalent of a floppy disk compared to what\u2019s coming in just 2 years.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd39 So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?\r\nI stopped assuming humans had the answers. I asked AI:\r\nGiven everything you know about me after working on this for two years\u2014what should I do? Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it.\r\n\r\nIt told me to:\r\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Learn AI automation & implementation to help companies integrate AI.\r\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use AI to optimize my own job search and publicly document the process.\r\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Monetize my dog on social media. Yes, really. (I know this sounds crazy\u2014but check out the comments below.)\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude80 The Experiment: Let AI Guide My Next Career Move\r\nRather than resisting AI, I\u2019m embracing it. AI will dictate how I allocate my time based on feedback from this post, my job search efforts, and business automation case studies. I\u2019ll be sharing:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udccc AI-powered job search automation\r\n\ud83d\udccc How AI can replace or enhance traditional business processes\r\n\ud83d\udccc Experiments with AI-driven content growth\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd39Please Help...\r\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Engage with this post. Share, comment and like\u2014it will help me reach the right people.\r\n\r\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you know of AI-driven roles where I can help companies adopt, implement, or optimize AI tools, let\u2019s talk. I'm more than willing to start over on salary.
