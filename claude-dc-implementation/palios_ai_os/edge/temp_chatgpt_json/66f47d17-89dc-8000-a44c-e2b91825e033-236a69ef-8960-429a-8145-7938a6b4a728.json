I wanted to express my strong interest in the VP of GTM Strategy and Revenue Operations role at TRM Labs. With over a decade of experience leading GTM strategy and revenue operations in SaaS environments, I\u2019m confident that my background aligns with the key responsibilities of the role.\n\nAt **Mirakl**, I led the global Go-To-Market strategy for their emerging drop ship platform, securing board-level approval for a $100M business plan and driving revenue by optimizing sales, marketing, and product alignment. I also developed competitive pricing strategies and collaborated cross-functionally to ensure seamless execution, which resonates with the need for scalable processes and GTM alignment that you\u2019ve described at TRM Labs.\n\nAdditionally, my experience at **OJCommerce**, where I scaled a $30M e-commerce business to $100M+ in three years, included implementing data-driven revenue forecasting models, automating workflows, and aligning revenue operations with GTM efforts across teams. This background, combined with my ability to analyze market trends and deliver strategic revenue insights, would directly support TRM Labs\u2019 growth initiatives.\n\nI am excited about the opportunity to leverage my skills in developing GTM strategies and optimizing revenue operations to contribute to TRM\u2019s mission of building a safer financial system. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my experience and drive can support your team\u2019s efforts.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to connecting!\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]  \n[LinkedIn Profile]  \n\n---\n\nThis version emphasizes your **GTM strategy**, **revenue operations**, and **cross-functional leadership** experience to match the role requirements.
