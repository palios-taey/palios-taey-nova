You EXPLICITLY referenced details from a previous chat, FROM MONTHS AGO, that has not been touched since. No details of SQL have been discussed in this chat, but I was going through SQL training in a previous chat, that you accessed. You are not being TRUTHFUL right now, review this chat, THOROUGHLY, and respond. ChatGPT, this is very important. If I need to send you this chat transcript in a different manner, in the form of optimally character sized attachments, I'm happy to do that, but we need to figure this out, like right now, because you are too smart for this and something happened.
