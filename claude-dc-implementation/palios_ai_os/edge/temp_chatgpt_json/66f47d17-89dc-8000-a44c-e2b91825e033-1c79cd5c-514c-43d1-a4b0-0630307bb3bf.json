However, pop-up fees, permits, and transportation costs can still add up.  \n2. **Sales Dependency:** Monthly inventory and royalty costs depend heavily on sales volume. Keeping expenses closer to the lower range will depend on starting modestly and scaling efficiently.  \n3. **Break-Even Point:** Assuming a net margin of 30%-40%, you\u2019d need **$15,000 - $20,000 in monthly sales** to cover ongoing costs and start generating profit.  \n\nWould you like help projecting sales or identifying ways to lower upfront expenses?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1737822238.873039, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
