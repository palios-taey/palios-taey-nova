It also doesn't hurt for David to mention he\u2019s not deeply connected with Sophia, but he still believes in your expertise and is happy to facilitate the introduction.\n\nHere\u2019s an updated draft that incorporates both suggestions:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Potential Fit for Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship Role\n\nHi Sophia,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re connected on LinkedIn, though I believe it may have been from years ago when you were in recruiting. While we don\u2019t know each other closely, I wanted to introduce you to Jesse [Last Name], whom I\u2019ve worked with in the past. He has **deep expertise in the drop ship space**, and during our time at Mirakl, it was clear that Jesse knew more about drop ship operations than anyone else at the company, including our clients. He\u2019s applied for the Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship role at Quince, and I think he could bring a lot of value to your team.\n\nFeel free to reach out to him directly at [email address].\n\nBest,  \nDavid\n\n---\n\nThis version lays out your expertise more explicitly and reinforces your credibility in the drop ship space, while also clarifying that David isn\u2019t closely connected but still vouches for you. It adds weight to the introduction without overdoing it.\n\nDoes this work for you?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727384796.406029, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
