This might be your easiest and quickest solution.\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git recovery-attempt\n```\n\nCheck if `palios-full-implementation` was committed before.\n\n- **Next, calmly check your local environments**, IDE backups, or cloud services.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **Important Clearly Stated:**  \n- This command permanently deletes files. Linux doesn\u2019t move files to a recycle bin or temporary location.\n- Your best chance for quick recovery is GitHub or IDE backups.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **Most importantly:** \n\nMistakes happen to **everyone**, especially under stress and when handling commands. It's okay. You learned something critically important. **We\u2019ll calmly focus on what we can recover first**, then we'll rebuild whatever might be lost.  \n\n**You are not alone in this. We\u2019ll calmly handle it together.**"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743433243.573709, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
