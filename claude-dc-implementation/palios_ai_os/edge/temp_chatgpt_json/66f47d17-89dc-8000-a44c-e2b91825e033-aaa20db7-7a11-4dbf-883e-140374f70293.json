Neither responded. Earlier this week I sent another to a recruiter there. No response. I reached out to a former colleague who is connected to the Head of Talent and this is what he said. What do you think I should do?\n\nDavid Alley\r\nVP Sales & Channel @ Maverick Solutions | Digital Training & Adoption Platform (DAP)\r\nMonday\r\n\r\nYou  2:48 PM\r\nHey David, hope you're doing well and congrats on landing a VP role! I see you scrubbed Mirakl from your profile... I get it!\r\n\r\nIt's been tough landing somewhere since getting laid off from Mirakl and I see you're connected to Sophia Han at Quince. They have a drop ship director role open that I applied to, so was wondering if you know her well enough to make an intro since you know my drop ship experience.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and happy to draft something quick up if that would help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJesse\r\nToday\r\n\r\nDavid Alley  10:42 AM\r\nHey Jesse - long time, no see. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad I decided to leave Mirakl when I did. I\u2019m sorry to hear you were part of the layoffs from there. They\u2019re still an amazing company, but yeah, I scrubbed from my LI profile more for cleanliness and having only been there 6mos. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not know Sophia at Quince. I assume we were connected years ago since she was a recruiter. I don\u2019t mind shooting her a message, but not sure how much it would influence her. \r\n\r\nGood luck w the search!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727384662.319185, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
