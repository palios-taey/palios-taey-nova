You should have all table structures from previous screenshots and notes on updates completed since then. First, can you review all this and add definitions for each table and property to a new Canvas so we can track changes/updates as we go through reviewing the sample data and testing process? I had initially requested this be included in the Charter, but think this is a separate document since very tactical and will need to be updatable to enable future growth and sophistication and efficiency.
