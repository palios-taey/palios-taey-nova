It\u2019s been awesome watching you build it into what it is today\u2014huge congrats on all the success, I know you hustled hard for it!\n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for 2 years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is flipping everything upside down, and the job market is shifting faster than anyone is prepared for.\n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my career transformation experiment using AI\u2014and I\u2019d love your help.\n\nYou\u2019ve built an incredible audience by taking big swings, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing here. If you think it\u2019s interesting, a reshare, comment, or even just a like would help get it in front of the right people.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014would love for you to check it out. If you have any advice to share after taking a look, that'd be awesome too. \n\nThanks, man. Appreciate it.\n\n\u2014 Jesse"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739207142.08926, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
