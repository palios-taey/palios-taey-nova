Leveraging Existing Relationships**\n\nLily AI can immediately benefit from leveraging my existing connections, particularly with **Tweezerman** and **Leonard Green & Partners**, both of which offer access to relevant retail networks and opportunities for scalable expansion.\n\n- **Tweezerman Partnership**: Tweezerman works with a range of **mid-sized beauty retailers** such as **Sally Beauty**, **Bluemercury**, and **Beauty Brands**. They have around **15-20 relevant retail partners** that could benefit from Lily AI's product attribution solutions. I propose offering Tweezerman a **free Proof-of-Value (PoV)** to demonstrate the value of Lily AI\u2019s platform in real time by improving product metrics across Tweezerman\u2019s listings on these retail sites.\n\n    The **mutual benefit** comes from Tweezerman introducing Lily AI to its retail partners, showcasing **firsthand improvements** in metrics such as conversion rate, discovery, and sales uplift. **Pending successful introductions and potential closed deals**, this would lead to an **ongoing complementary solution** for Tweezerman at a reduced cost. Additionally, as Lily AI\u2019s platform delivers value across these partners\u2019 full catalogs, Tweezerman will benefit from better product placement and sales lifts with each partner, creating a **feedback loop** of improved performance.\n\n    **Scalability Potential**: If this **pilot program** with Tweezerman proves successful, the same low-cost PoV approach can be expanded to other **small-to-mid-sized brands** across sectors like beauty, fashion, and home goods. The goal is to use these brands as **entry points** to larger retailers, eventually expanding Lily AI\u2019s reach by focusing on brands with strong retail networks.\n\n- **Leonard Green & Partners**: As the **SVP of Procurement** at Leonard Green is a close connection, there\u2019s a significant opportunity to engage their portfolio of retail brands, such as **J.Crew**, **Petco**, **The Container Store**, and **JOANN Stores**. I would propose a **bundled approach** offering Lily AI\u2019s solution across multiple brands under Leonard Green\u2019s umbrella. Their **centralized procurement model** provides an efficient way to **bundle product attribution services**, streamlining the process and potentially unlocking multiple retail clients at once.\n\n#### **2. Cold Outreach Strategy**\n\nI\u2019ve successfully implemented **scalable and efficient cold outreach processes** in past roles, including at OJCommerce, where I led initiatives that helped the company grow from $30M to $100M+ in revenue. I propose applying a **targeted, data-driven approach** to cold outreach for Lily AI, focusing on specific SKUs and insights that will immediately grab a retailer\u2019s attention.\n\nThe key to successful cold outreach is **personalization and relevance**. To stand out, the strategy would involve **identifying SKUs** managed by Lily AI that have seen a **significant lift in performance** and then finding retailers who have these SKUs among their top sellers. The outreach email would highlight the **proven lift** that Lily AI has driven in comparable SKUs, positioning Lily AI as the solution that can **unlock additional value** for the retailer.\n\nHere\u2019s how the process would unfold:\n- **SKU Analysis**: Analyze the current SKUs managed by Lily AI, focusing on those with the highest lift metrics.\n- **Target Retailers**: Identify target retailers in the fashion, beauty, and home goods sectors who carry those SKUs or similar ones.\n- **Personalized Outreach**: Craft highly specific and relevant outreach messages that use **real-world data** to demonstrate Lily AI\u2019s value.\n\nBy aligning Lily AI\u2019s success stories with retailers\u2019 top sellers, we can position the solution as an **obvious next step** for increasing their sales performance. The plan includes **iterating and testing** the success of each email campaign, refining based on metrics like open rates and response rates, and sharing **best practices** with the team.\n\n#### **3. Referral and Co-Marketing Partnerships**\n\nLily AI should actively pursue **referral partnerships** with platforms that cater to retailers managing large SKU catalogs. These partnerships can unlock **cross-promotional opportunities** and help to tap into **new networks** of potential clients. Here are a few key platforms and companies that align with Lily AI\u2019s offerings:\n\n- **VTEX**: Offers enterprise-grade e-commerce platforms for managing large catalogs. A partnership with VTEX could facilitate introductions to their retail clients.\n- **Radial**: A provider of omnichannel solutions that already works with many large retailers, focusing on distribution and fulfillment.\n- **Rithum** (formerly CommerceHub): With strong expertise in managing supplier relationships and SKU expansion, Rithum could be a strategic partner for Lily AI, providing access to a network of retailers.\n- **Fabric**: A modular and headless commerce platform that serves enterprise retailers with vast catalogs. Partnering with Fabric could open doors to clients who need Lily AI\u2019s attribution solutions to enhance their product offerings.\n- **Marketplacer**: A marketplace platform that could provide joint opportunities for retailers looking to improve SKU management and discovery.\n\nThese referral partnerships would be accompanied by **co-marketing efforts**, such as joint webinars, case studies, and thought leadership articles to showcase the value of both Lily AI and the partner platform.\n\n#### **4. Thought Leadership and LinkedIn Engagement**\n\nAs an executive with deep experience in **managing large catalogs across multiple product categories** and overseeing vast e-commerce networks, I plan to leverage **LinkedIn** to engage with retail professionals and thought leaders. The content will focus on:\n- Best practices for managing large SKU catalogs.\n- Overcoming common challenges in e-commerce operations, particularly around **product attribution and discovery**.\n- Sharing Lily AI\u2019s success stories, combined with my insights, to position myself as a **trusted resource** and drive organic interest in Lily AI\u2019s solutions.\n\nAdditionally, I will engage with and amplify Lily AI\u2019s **marketing content** by adding my personal experience and addressing the **pain points** I\u2019ve encountered in my roles at OJCommerce, CommerceHub, and Mirakl.\n\n#### **5. Marketing Initiative: Influencer Webinar**\n\nOne of the most effective ways to gain visibility in Lily AI\u2019s target markets is through **webinars and thought leadership events**. I would propose organizing a **webinar series** focused on the benefits of AI/ML-driven product attribution for retailers with large catalogs. An ideal speaker would be someone like **Rick Watson**, a well-respected industry influencer I\u2019ve worked with during my time at CommerceHub.\n\nRick\u2019s insights were highly valuable at CommerceHub, and he has significant credibility within the retail and e-commerce space. Partnering with him for a **co-branded webinar** could help Lily AI attract a wider audience, and his influence would boost attendance from retailers already struggling with **SKU management challenges**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of My Existing Connections**\n\nIn addition to the Tweezerman and Leonard Green relationships, I have **30+ existing connections** in the retail and e-commerce sectors that align with Lily AI\u2019s target market. These include executives and decision-makers at companies like:\n- **Sally Beauty**\n- **Bluemercury**\n- **Linen Chest**\n- **Abercrombie & Fitch**\n- **Petco**\n- **The Container Store**\n- **Tweezerman International** (key retailers in beauty and home sectors)\n\nThese connections would provide Lily AI with direct access to influential figures in the **beauty, home goods, and fashion** industries. I can leverage these relationships to **accelerate introductions**, establish rapport with key decision-makers, and open doors to potential deals in line with Lily AI\u2019s goals.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if this plan is aligned with what you were envisioning!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727987720.991248, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
