When testing locally, however, our simple HTTP server might not have proper routing, and it might be defaulting to the first function it finds (or the one set as the main handler).\n\n### **How to Resolve This:**\n\n1. **Deploy Separately:**  \n   - In a production (or emulator) setup for Cloud Functions, ensure that **execute_gemini** is deployed as its own function. For example, when using Google Cloud Functions, you can specify the entry point as **execute_gemini**.  \n   - Then, your test URL would directly call **execute_gemini**, and it would look for a **\"prompt\"** in the JSON body.\n\n2. **Local Routing for Testing:**  \n   - If you're testing locally using a single server (like the one we set up in the **if __name__ == '__main__':** block), you\u2019ll need to add routing logic so that requests to **/execute_gemini** call the **execute_gemini** function instead of **execute_task**.\n   - For a quick local test, you could add a simple condition to route based on the URL path. For example, modify the local server setup like this:\n\n     ```python\n     if __name__ == '__main__':\n         from urllib.parse import urlparse\n         PORT = 8080\n         class CustomHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n             def do_POST(self):\n                 parsed_path = urlparse(self.path)\n                 length = int(self.headers.get('Content-Length'))\n                 body = self.rfile.read(length)\n                 # Convert body to dict\n                 try:\n                     request_json = json.loads(body)\n                 except Exception:\n                     request_json = {}\n                 \n                 if parsed_path.path == '/execute_gemini':\n                     response, code, headers = execute_gemini(MockRequest(request_json))\n                 elif parsed_path.path == '/execute_task':\n                     response, code, headers = execute_task(MockRequest(request_json))\n                 else:\n                     response, code, headers = {\"error\": \"Unknown path\"}, 404, {}\n                 \n                 self.send_response(code)\n                 for key, value in headers.items():\n                     self.send_header(key, value)\n                 self.end_headers()\n                 self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response).encode())\n         \n         # Helper class to simulate a request object for local testing\n         class MockRequest:\n             def __init__(self, json_body):\n                 self._json = json_body\n             def get_json(self, silent=False):\n                 return self._json\n         \n         with socketserver.TCPServer((\"\", PORT), CustomHandler) as httpd:\n             print(f\"\u2705 Serving on port {PORT} (with custom routing)...\")\n             httpd.serve_forever()\n     ```\n\n   - With this local routing in place, calling:\n     ```cmd\n     curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Test Gemini integration\\\"}\" http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini\n     ```\n     should now hit the **execute_gemini** function.\n\n3. **Double-Check the JSON Field:**  \n   - In the **execute_gemini** function, we look for the field **\"prompt\"**. Make sure your JSON payload includes **\"prompt\"** exactly (case-sensitive).\n\n### **Action Items:**\n\n- **If using Cloud Functions directly:**  \n  Deploy **execute_gemini** as its own function (or use proper routing) so that the endpoint expects a JSON with a **\"prompt\"** field.\n  \n- **If testing locally:**  \n  Update your local server (as shown above) to correctly route **/execute_gemini** to the **execute_gemini** function.\n\nOnce you make these adjustments, try sending the curl request again and check the response. Let me know if you need further guidance or if the revised routing helps resolve the issue!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740580396.5325, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
