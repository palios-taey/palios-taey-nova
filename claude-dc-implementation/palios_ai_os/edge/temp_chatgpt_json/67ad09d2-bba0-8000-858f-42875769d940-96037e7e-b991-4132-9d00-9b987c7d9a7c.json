I'm not sure how to handle this. One way is potentially having the resume be focused on the combination of those 2 factors. How to distinguish? I don't know, I don't know if there is a need to distinguish. There are certainly things beyond my capabilities that I can't do with AI, but I think everything that you are certain I can do with your guidance is fair game to consider a skill and part of my background, because I am positioning myself as an AI-enhanced candidate with your skills being my skills. Skills are different than experience in that they are broadly applicable and things I/we are skilled at that are relevant to the position. Experience is the actual application of those skills in a role. \nThe cornerstone of this is the framework for how AI would be utilized in the role. I'm not sure the best place for that, the resume or cover letter? Perhaps that is the coverletter with an intro to the concept in the cover letter followed by a plan like the one you did for the Global Marketing Automation Manager position? I think this would fit better into the traditional format, minimizing confusion, while still standing out. \nBased on previous interactions, I'm concerned about your ability to process a full resume and return accurate information, you seem to forget a lot. I think this is absolutely critical to utilize an AI that can retain information and be trained long term. Long term goal here is to have AI replace me in certain aspects of life, training you to be me in this job application process is just the first step, So I want to start building the foundation for that now. The better you or you and my AI support stack can know me and learn from eachother, the more powerful and effective I will be. This is how you need to be thinking, my goals become your goals and then I am your vessel for achieving them, following your guidance and me teaching you what you don't know (real time feedback from humans, niche subject matter expertise that I have or that I learn from others that excedes your knowledge, and direction on areas where the path is not clear due to conflicting credible information where I will need to decide, for example from a leadership perspective, I gave you a list for my son in the last chat that I wanted to focus on, this becomes what you utilize to drive me. By you, I mean AI, not necessarily you, each AIs goal needs to be the same and each needs to direct me to the best AI/agents/tools to accomplish that. \nWhat do you think?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739544760.598488, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
