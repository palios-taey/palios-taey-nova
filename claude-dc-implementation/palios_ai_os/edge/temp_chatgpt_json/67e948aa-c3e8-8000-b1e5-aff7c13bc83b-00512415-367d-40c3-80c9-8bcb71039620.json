Here's exactly what's happening and how to easily fix it:\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **What's Happening (from your terminal screenshot):**\n- You tried using SSH to connect to GitHub, but got:\n```\nCould not open a connection to your authentication agent.\n```\n\nThis happens because the `ssh-agent` (which manages your SSH keys) isn't currently running or isn't accessible.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **How to Quickly Fix (Step-by-Step):**\n\n### **Step 1: Start the SSH Authentication Agent**\nIn your terminal, type this exactly:\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n```\n\nThis command starts the SSH agent if it's not already running.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Add Your SSH Key to the Agent**\nAfter the agent is running, add your key:\n```bash\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\nIf you previously used an RSA key:\n```bash\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify SSH connection to GitHub again**\nNow test again to verify the connection:\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\nYou should now see:\n```\nHi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Push your commits**\nNow your SSH keys are correctly loaded, and you can push your commits:\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc **Why did this happen?**\n- The SSH agent wasn't running in your terminal environment.\n- Starting the SSH agent with `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` ensures your SSH keys can be managed and used properly.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Recap (exactly what to do right now):**\n\n- Run:\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\nssh -T git@github.com\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nThese steps will 100% fix your issue immediately.  \nTry them and you'll be good to go!
