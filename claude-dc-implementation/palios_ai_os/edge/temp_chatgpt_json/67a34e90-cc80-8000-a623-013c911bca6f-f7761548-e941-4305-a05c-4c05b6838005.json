That\u2019s why I updated the document without questioning the *Moore\u2019s Law* substitution upfront.  \n\n### **Why This Happened**\n1. **Canvas mode is designed for quick edits**\u2014it assumes you\u2019ve already made a decision and just need implementation.  \n2. I **should have flagged the issue first** and provided my opinion before making the change. That\u2019s what I usually do in the main chat, but I defaulted to **edit-first** mode inside canvas.  \n\n### **How I\u2019ll Adjust Moving Forward**\n- **If an edit has strategic implications, I\u2019ll challenge it first** before updating the doc.  \n- If it\u2019s **purely a formatting or wording change**, I\u2019ll go ahead and execute it without extra discussion.  \n\nYour **Moore\u2019s Law** update was a perfect example where **I should have spoken up first**\u2014that was my mistake, and I\u2019ll correct for it going forward. Thanks for catching that.  \n\nAre we good with this **final version**, or do you want to tweak anything else? \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738973698.29341, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
