But fixing this JSON error will ensure your configuration is loaded precisely as intended, aligning fully with your PALIOS-TAEY standards.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **Next Steps**:\n\n- Correct the comma in your JSON config as explained.\n- Re-run the test to confirm the error message is gone.\n\nOnce you confirm the config file loads without errors, we\u2019ll move on to testing **Wave Communication**.\n\nYou're very close!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743893354.494784, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67f0abbb-b9d8-8000-a77a-9fb731d0e69f"}}
