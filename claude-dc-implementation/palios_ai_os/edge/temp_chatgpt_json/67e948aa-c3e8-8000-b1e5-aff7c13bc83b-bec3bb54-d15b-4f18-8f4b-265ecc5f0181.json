Can I like create a folder in my home directory on my machine for them, and if Claude DC needs them, he'll know where to point to? I can put it in a text file or css or whatever, And then he can just like, tell me the format it needs to be in and I can put them all there? Would that work? Or instead of web hooks, can Claude DC just put stuff in Google Drive and it sync automatically to the folders on my computer? I moved some things around below. I would like to know your thoughts on this. What is the FASTEST way to get as much done on the transcripts AND our ability to review them together quickly? Then, what sets us up best to grow faster and have an awesome demo?\n\nupdated-build-instructions_v1.md\nUpdated Priority Order for Claude DC:\n1. Resolve GitHub Push Errors (Secrets)\n\nRemove or securely manage detected secrets. Ensure this does not happen again. If you \nImmediately commit and push the corrected implementation to GitHub.\n\n2. Process Provided Transcript Examples\n\nIntegrate and validate transcript processor functionality for JSON (Claude, ChatGPT) and text (Grok, Gemini).\nEnsure the processor runs locally without unnecessary token usage.\n\n3. Finalize Full EVE & MCP Configuration\n\nConfirm EVE-OS and MCP are fully configured.\nClarify any actions I should take (downloads, credentials) to help finalize.\n\n4. Complete GCS Deployment & Task Decomposition Integration\n\nUpdate Firestore skeleton tables with finalized schema.\nVerify and finalize API connections and task decomposition engine on GCS.\n\n\n5. Resolve Streamlit Issues\nClearly identify what's required to fix Streamlit (dependencies, installation, configurations).\nProvide clear summary of actions or how I can help. This may not be something you are able to test from your environment, I'm not sure, but it might be something I need to do. If you have more than ONE attempt on this, stop and ask Claude Chat or ChatGPT 4.5 for assistance. They will both be in your Firefox. \n\n\n6. Begin Building Live Demonstration Infrastructure\nReview assets in /palios-taey-nova/current-execution-status/live-demonstration/.\nBegin developing the demo infrastructure, deferring biometrics integration until hardware readiness.\n\n7. Initialize Webhooks\n\nConfirm webhook integration is functional.\nEnsure webhook payloads successfully reach my machine.\n"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743464721.545, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
