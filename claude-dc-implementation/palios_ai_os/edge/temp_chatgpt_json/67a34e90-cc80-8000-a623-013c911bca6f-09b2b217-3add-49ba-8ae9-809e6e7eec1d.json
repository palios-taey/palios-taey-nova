I feel like if I set up something really cool and leave it in a comment right after the post that that would be sweet. I'm a little concerned about posting Friday and having nothing set up and not being able to do everything I can to make it go viral. Monday is after superbowl, so prob not best either. I can probably wait until Tuesday AM if you think that is a good idea to work on something cool for that and maybe do some social media automation as well if we can fit it in. I'm also open to just doing this tomorrow morning, maybe prioritizing some AI tools for this evening (we're about to eat dinner and my son is here, so a little tough) or can pull a late night doing some stuff. What do you think would be best to maximize engagement potential no later than Tuesday AM?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738888873.136266, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
