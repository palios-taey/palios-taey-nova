Referral and Co-Marketing Partnerships**\n\nLily AI could establish impactful referral partnerships with companies whose technologies complement Lily\u2019s own, particularly those serving retailers with large SKU catalogs. These partnerships would drive top-of-funnel leads through co-marketing initiatives and offer immediate value to Lily AI by leveraging their established networks.\n\n**Potential Partners**: I propose targeting companies such as **VTEX**, **Marketplacer**, **Fabric**, **Radial**, and **Rithum**. These companies provide complementary services such as e-commerce supply chain management, digital marketplaces, and data optimization, and they cater to retailers managing large SKU catalogs. Their existing client relationships present excellent opportunities to introduce Lily AI\u2019s solutions, especially as these clients actively seek ways to improve **product attribution**, **discovery**, and **conversion rates**.\n\n**Proven Success**: Having successfully driven similar partnership efforts at CommerceHub, I\u2019m confident that these tactics will provide strong returns. At CommerceHub, I led the **implementation of a partnership-centric go-to-market strategy**, securing high-impact relationships with platforms like **Google Shopping** and **Walmart**, which helped boost Marketplace Platform revenues. These co-marketing initiatives included joint webinars and targeted marketing campaigns that broadened our reach and led to rapid client growth.\n\nI could **independently manage** and drive these partnership efforts at Lily AI due to my experience in this area. These companies are not only open to partnerships that enhance their service offerings but are also actively seeking ways to drive **revenue lifts** from value-added referral opportunities. Lily AI\u2019s innovative solutions, combined with co-branded marketing, could offer them just that.\n\n**Co-Marketing Initiatives**: Joint marketing efforts could include:\n- **Webinars**: Featuring both Lily AI and the partner company to showcase Lily\u2019s solutions alongside the partner\u2019s complementary technologies.\n- **Thought Leadership Panels**: Focused on addressing challenges faced by retailers in managing product data and increasing conversion rates.\n- **Whitepapers and Case Studies**: That present Lily AI\u2019s technology alongside partner success stories, offering a powerful narrative to their combined audiences.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if this works for your document, or if you\u2019d like any other adjustments!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727988573.410151, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
