In the next 15, I'd like to talk with you about strategy for X. I'm thinking that X is where I build my personal brand. I'd like your feedback on my thoughts on personal brand: AI explorer, guy with a sweet dog who catches footballs that goes to the beach every day, very fit and healthy 42 yr old male, does cool stuff and highly advanced/elite training techniques, nutrition and supplementation with his son to help him train for football and make him a freak athlete (we do insanity workouts together, lift and I get in full football pads to help him with training). I think that I should remove Chewy's X profile and fold that content into my own, while maintaining the fun presence on just Insta and TikTok, abandoning other platforms unless at some point they make sense (i.e. store on facebook for brand, youtube if we're doing in depth dog trick or obedience training).
