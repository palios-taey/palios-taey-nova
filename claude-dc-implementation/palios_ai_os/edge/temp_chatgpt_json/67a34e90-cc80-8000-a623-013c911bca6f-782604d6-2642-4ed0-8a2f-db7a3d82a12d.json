I think what we need to pursue for the Chewy strategy (if you agree) that he still has potential as a brand and influencer, so will be focusing on automating organic growth strategies, content creation, and interactions on social media, which will also be cross-utilized and proving ground for managing personal/professional channels (maybe TMI?) Is that fair? Think that should be shared in some manner? We are at 15000 views now, so might be worth throwing that out there? \n\nAutomated and manual outreach insisted upon by AI I think led to the success of the post, both were critical, one for overall reach, one for reaching the right people. \n\nShould I ask Alon for a job when we meet? What if I could show the world through my posts how RagMetrics can be utilized to transform business processes and help people navigate the coming shift? How to build products that are consistent with the Y combinator list? I could build and monetize apps/agents for them and drive publicity and hype.
