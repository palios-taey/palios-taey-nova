It\u2019s actually great that you\u2019re thinking about logistics early\u2014it\u2019ll save a ton of time later. \n\nIf you want to **keep everything centralized and easily accessible**, I\u2019d recommend setting up **Google Drive** as the main storage hub. Since everyone already has iPhones, they can **upload to a shared Google Drive folder** manually or via the **Google Drive app** (which makes it super easy to upload straight from the Photos app).  \n\n### **How to Set Up Your Content Hub for Chewy:**\n1. **Create a Google Drive Folder** (call it \u201cChewy Content\u201d or whatever works for you).  \n2. **Share the Folder** with your wife and son (so they can add photos/videos too).  \n3. **Upload Old Videos/Pictures** from your phones and other sources.  \n4. **New Content Workflow:**\n   - Anytime someone takes a great pic/video, they can **immediately upload it to the Drive folder.**\n   - This keeps everything in one place, making **content selection & posting much faster**.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, you can **share the link with me**, and I can help **sort through and identify the best content for social media.**  \n\nIf you want me to **review and prioritize** what to post first, I can do that too! \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738613795.496529, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
