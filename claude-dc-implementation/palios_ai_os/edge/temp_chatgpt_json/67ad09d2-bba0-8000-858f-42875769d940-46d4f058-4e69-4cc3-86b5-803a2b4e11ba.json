Totally understand if that wasn\u2019t an option, but if there\u2019s still room for it, I\u2019d be happy to tweak the messaging however needed to make it work. That would be so huge! It's like at the tipping point of virality and have had a few thought leaders comment/reach out.\r\n\r\nEither way, I really appreciate the team\u2019s time and the recommendation\u2014grateful for the support!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJesse"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739468379.024929, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
