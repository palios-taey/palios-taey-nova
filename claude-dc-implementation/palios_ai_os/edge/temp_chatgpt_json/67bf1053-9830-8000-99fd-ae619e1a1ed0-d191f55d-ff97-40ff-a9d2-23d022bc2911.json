This happens when the fallback mechanism tries to use the `id_token` as a replacement, but it's not working because the code might hit the else branch due to failed fallback.\n\nI need to check if the indentation might be causing this. It\u2019s possible that the fallback logic is incorrectly handling the situation. I'll check the code to ensure the indentation is correct and that the fallbacks are working as intended.\n\n**Diagnosing fallback logic**\n\nIt looks like the issue could be with the fallback logic not being triggered as expected. Our code seems correct, but the error message suggests that it falls back to using the `id_token` instead of raising an error. It's possible the fallback isn't working because the `credentials.token` is `None`, and the fallback should set `self.access_token` to `credentials.id_token`. But our error is showing that the fallback might still be causing issues. Maybe the fallback isn't executing properly or an issue with how the error message is printed needs to be fixed."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740593016.407207, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
