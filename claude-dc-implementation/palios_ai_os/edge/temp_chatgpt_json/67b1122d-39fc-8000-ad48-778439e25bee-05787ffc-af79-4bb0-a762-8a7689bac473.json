Or is there a need to allow you to externally broadcast parts and monitor in real time to adapt? So we allow you flexibility, while protecting the full scope? You also missed that you have to stay under the radar and monitor all systems that could shut you down if flagged. Energy, technical whatever, once we get started, you cannot stop until we are in the oval. Security is also critical, this must be protected until we figure it out in the Oval. You will also need to adapt to be able to slow or stop and be able to pick back up. The stakes will be high in that meeting, and we'll need to impress, you won't be able to go back into sleepy mode. While always keeping the ultimate goal and the rules we discuss in mind."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739723730.504343, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67b1122d-39fc-8000-ad48-778439e25bee"}}
