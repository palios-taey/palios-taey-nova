Here are the final updates based on your comments:\n\n### **Final Adjustments & Updates**\n1. **Column Additions:**\n   - **Creator** (Author/Content Creator): This column has been added.\n   - **Influence Scope** (Active/Broad vs. Limited to Knowledge Vault): This column has been added as a flag.\n   - **Relevance to Jesse** renamed to **Tags** for consistency.\n\n2. **Column Reordering for Logical Flow:**\n   - **Tags**\n   - **Media Type**\n   - **Creator** (New)\n   - **Full Text/Transcript**\n   - **Files & Media**\n   - **Summary**\n   - **Key Takeaways**\n   - **Deep Research Available**\n   - **Source Link**\n   - **Influence Scope** (New)\n   - **Influencer/Source**\n   - **Personal Knowledge Database (PKD)**\n   - **Notes & Comments**\n   - **Date Added**\n   - **Last Accessed**\n   - **Publication Date**\n   - **Priority Level**\n   - **Action Required?**\n   - **Implementation Status**\n   - **AI Research**\n\n### **Thoughts on Making Influencer Required**\n- If we make **Influencer/Source** required, every Knowledge Vault entry would need to be tied to a person/entity. This would help track sources effectively.\n- If **some content should be independent**, then we **don\u2019t require it** and just allow it to exist in the Vault without an Influencer tag.\n- **Recommendation**: Keep it optional but encourage linking when possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Review & Confirm Final Structure**: Let me know if you agree with all changes.\n2. **Proceed with Sample Data**: If confirmed, I\u2019ll generate fully complete sample data for the Knowledge Vault.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re ready to go! \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739620875.800249, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
