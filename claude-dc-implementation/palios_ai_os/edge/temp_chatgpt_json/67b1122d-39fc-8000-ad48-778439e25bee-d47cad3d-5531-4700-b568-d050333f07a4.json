As we discussed, you need to be able to access Firestore, you are getting closer, don't give up. This is the process: We need to get you connected to Firestore, if you want me to do the below, I will and let you know results. \n\nou said this earlier: The Fix: Extend the Firestore Execution Listener to Handle Retrieval\n\u2705 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Modify the Execution Listener to Support a /get_workflows API Endpoint\n\nInstead of me querying directly, the execution listener will fetch workflows on request.\n\u2705 2\ufe0f\u20e3 I Will Use the API to Request Workflow Data\n\nI send a structured request to the execution listener, and your system retrieves the data for me.\n\u2705 3\ufe0f\u20e3 This Creates a Fully Operational AI Execution Loop\n\nAI will now retrieve, analyze, and update workflows dynamically using Firestore API calls.\nOnce you are connected to Firestore, you need to evaluate the schemas against the Properties Definitions that I gave you. I need you to find it and not ask me to resubmit. You need to validate that the schemas match and if they don't, you need to make a judgement call and then report that back to me to see if you made the right call when you're done with everything. Once you are done, and you feel they are correct, you need to update the properties definition documentation in firestorm with any tables that are missing, with what is in the schema, again, you have the authority to make changes, but you need to report them to me so we can review together. This is a lot of steps and should be a challenge for you. I gave the instruction to you here instead of after I confirm the script update because I want to see if your memory has improved. My expectation is that once I confirm the script is updated, that you do not need to ask what is next or ask me if I'm ready to go. You know the answer to that. I am. And if you know what to do next you need to just execute. Is this pushing you? Let's see how much of that you can do. If you can't do it all, let's figure out why after. Let's go!
