I reviewed **a large portion**, but not **every single word**.  \n\ud83d\udccc The issue is that when processing **very long** text, I **prioritize** what seems relevant\u2014but sometimes miss **specific details** (like exact resume wording).  \n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Can I Retain Info Across Multiple Chats?**  \n\u26d4 **No, once a chat ends, I lose context.**   \n\u2705 However, within a single chat, I can **recall and modify** information effectively if we work within a single document.  \n\n---\n\n### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Why Was the Resume Inaccurate?**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 I processed **your previous resume uploads**, but when merging with the AI strategy, some **assumptions** were made where details weren\u2019t explicit.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 I referenced **general AI-augmented skills** and **structured the resume to match the new format**, but **some experience details were incorrectly inferred** rather than copied from your actual resume.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The best way to **fix this** is to **directly merge** your last submitted resume with the AI-powered format while keeping **everything factual**.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 How We Fix This & Work More Efficiently**  \n\u2705 **Re-upload the latest version of your resume** so I can **directly merge** it with the AI-augmented structure.  \n\u2705 We **work in a single document** (inside the canvas) so changes **persist**, and we don\u2019t lose context.  \n\u2705 If a **new chat is started**, you may need to re-upload key documents for full reference.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Next Steps**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Re-upload your latest resume file** (so I don\u2019t have to guess on past experience).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 I\u2019ll **directly merge it into the AI-Augmented Resume format** while keeping it 100% accurate.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 We **finalize** the AI-powered approach while ensuring your real experience is properly presented.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Let\u2019s lock this in properly so we can execute efficiently.** \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739412627.546695, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
