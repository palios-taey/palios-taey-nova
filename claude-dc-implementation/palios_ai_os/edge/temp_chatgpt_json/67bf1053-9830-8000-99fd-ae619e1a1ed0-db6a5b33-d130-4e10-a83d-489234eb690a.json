I see that the code checks for an access token first, then falls back to the `id_token` if it isn't available. Hmm, I\u2019ll need to look into this \u2014 maybe the issue is with handling the fallback correctly. The error message seems to be thrown from the token refresh logic. The user might be getting the `id_token` but not the expected `access_token`; possibly something's off with how the token response is processed.\n\n**Investigating token issue**\n\nThe error message suggests that `credentials.token` is not set, and the fallback block isn't triggered \u2014 possibly due to an indentation issue. I should ask the user to double-check their code's indentation to make sure it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, instead of the fallback, I could directly assign `credentials.id_token` if `credentials.token` is None. It\u2019s also worth noting that service account credentials might return `None` for `credentials.token`. Using `credentials.with_target_audience()` or fetching the ID token manually with the `id_token.fetch_id_token()` could help resolve this."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740593108.573947, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
