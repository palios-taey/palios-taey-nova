Here\u2019s a review with suggestions for refining your language and additional questions to enhance your response:\n\n---\n\n**Subject**: Follow-Up and Next Steps for AE Role at Lily AI\n\n**Hi Julian,**\n\nThank you again for your time yesterday and for providing more insight into Lily AI and the AE role. I understand the urgency around filling this position and want to help support your decision-making process. I\u2019m preparing a plan focused on generating top-of-funnel leads, which I\u2019ll submit tomorrow after speaking with Michael this afternoon.\n\nI have a few follow-up questions that would help me produce a higher-quality plan. If you have 15 minutes today, it would be great to discuss over the phone, or email works just as well.\n\n1. **What are the target accounts for this AE role?** In the plan, I'll focus on these accounts and highlight any existing relationships I have or connections I can leverage in Lily\u2019s targeted retail segments.\n   \n2. **What is the sales quota for this role**, and how many new logos are required to meet this quota on average?\n\n3. **Has Lily considered targeting brands in addition to retailers?** If not, can you share why?\n\n4. **Does Lily\u2019s technology support transforming supplier data into retailer product data requirements?** Understanding this will help me illustrate specific value propositions for both current and prospective clients.\n\n5. You mentioned you\u2019ve worked on some partnerships, but I noticed there\u2019s a Partnerships Director. **Would this AE role have the ability to pursue referral partnerships to support lead generation**, or is that scope outside of the role?\n\nFinally, you mentioned the possibility of a **panel interview and presentation** similar to the one conducted at Mirakl. Given the urgency, I\u2019d be happy to start preparing and schedule that presentation once the details of the assignment are provided\u2014even if the decision to move forward hasn\u2019t been finalized yet.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon, and thanks again for the opportunity!\n\nBest regards,  \nJesse\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **Polished Language**: I refined some phrases to sound more polished and concise while maintaining a positive tone.\n- **Additional Questions**:\n   - You might want to consider asking about **timeframes** (e.g., How quickly are you expected to hit the ground running?) or **support resources** (e.g., Will there be SDR/BDR support for lead generation, or will the AE be handling everything end-to-end?).\n   - I reworded some questions to sound a little more open-ended, giving Julian the chance to clarify any potential opportunities for brand partnerships or referral leads.\n\nThis version balances being proactive and respectful of the team\u2019s time, while ensuring you\u2019re gathering the necessary details to succeed."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727878670.265438, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
