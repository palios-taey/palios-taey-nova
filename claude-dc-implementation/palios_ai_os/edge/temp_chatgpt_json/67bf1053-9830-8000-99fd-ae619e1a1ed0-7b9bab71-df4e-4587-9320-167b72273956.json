This might be because a previous instance of your server is still running or another process is bound to that port. To resolve this, you can either:\n\n1. **Terminate the Process Using Port 8080:**  \n   - Run the command:\n     ```cmd\n     netstat -ano | findstr :8080\n     ```\n     to identify the process ID (PID) using the port.\n   - Then, kill the process with:\n     ```cmd\n     taskkill /PID <PID> /F\n     ```\n     replacing `<PID>` with the actual process ID.\n\n2. **Change the Port Number:**  \n   - Modify the `PORT` variable in your __main__ block in **main.py** to a different, unused port (e.g., 8081).\n   - For example, update:\n     ```python\n     PORT = 8080\n     ```\n     to:\n     ```python\n     PORT = 8081\n     ```\n   - Save the file and run:\n     ```cmd\n     python main.py\n     ```\n\nEither approach should resolve the port conflict. If you're testing locally, changing the port is usually the quickest solution. Let me know once you've resolved this, and we can proceed with verifying the Gemini integration endpoint."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740590946.524039, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
