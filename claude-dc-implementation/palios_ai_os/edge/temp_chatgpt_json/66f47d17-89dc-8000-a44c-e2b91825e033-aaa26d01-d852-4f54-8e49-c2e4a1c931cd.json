This document will give you the opportunity to \"look under the hood\" of the franchise. Because franchises are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), this information is updated yearly, is audited information, and has to be accurate or there are serious consequences and penalties to the franchisor. \r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that the FDD is written by an attorney on behalf of the franchise in order to protect the franchise system, something you will appreciate when you are a franchisee within their system. Keep in mind, this document will always sound one-sided with all franchises, so don't feel that this is a unique situation.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to help you be successful in this process. Going through an FDD can be an intimidating task so we had a franchise attorney design this guide for you. Feel free to use the FDD review document to assist you in what is important to pay attention to in each of the 23 items contained within the FDD. It can also help to cut down on the reading time in the initial stages of the FDD review. \r\n\r\nIt is not necessary and not recommended to read entire document at this stage. You will ultimately read the entire document for the brand that you are moving forward with at later stages preferably with a Franchise Attorney. At this stage it is most important to focus on financial sections 5, 6, 7 , 19 , and 21. The brand will be reviewing the financially related sections with you on your Unit Economics Call. As you read these sections keep in mind if the financial information does not meet your financial needs and/or objective goals the rest of the document is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n**If you have the time and are interested in reading more than the section above, I urge you to read the document as an overview summary and not get to deep into the weeds other than that financial sections stated. \r\n\r\n\r\nClick here for an overview of how to read the FDD, please feel free to call or email me with any questions. \r\n\r\n \r\nA couple of things to keep in mind\u2026\r\nYou will be asked to sign a receipt that you received the FDD because franchise companies are required by law to provide prospective investors with the FDD at least 14-days prior to signing a Franchise. By signing an FDD receipt, you are not signing a Franchise Agreement or entering into any kind of obligation or commitment, you are just verifying that you received the document.\r\n \r\nWhile there are rarely any material changes made to these agreements,  I can refer you to experienced franchise lawyers to point out areas where you might be able to achieve language modification and other potential concessions before you sign the final agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEnjoy the read! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regard,\r\n\r\nSeth\n\n"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1731284459.1588, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
