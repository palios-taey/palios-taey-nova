And if technological acceleration continues at its current pace, the next two years won\u2019t just be another leap forward\u2014it will be the equivalent of all progress made since the dawn of computing.\u201d**  \n\n### **Final Recommendation**\nIf **Moore\u2019s Law** is there **for reader familiarity**, you can keep it\u2014but **it\u2019s not the best model** for AI\u2019s evolution. If you want **accuracy**, I'd **replace it with a more generalized statement** about accelerating AI development.  \n\nWould you like to **keep, modify, or replace** it based on this? \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738973481.634799, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
