It\u2019s been an incredibly challenging time for my family and me. If you\u2019ve experienced long-term unemployment, you understand. If you haven\u2019t, I hope you never do. But with the **exponential advances in AI**, I believe many white-collar workers will soon face the same reality.   \\n  \\nToday, I\u2019m asking for your help. **Not just for me, but to test a new way forward.**  \\n  \\n### **\ud83d\udd39 How I Got Here & Why Job Searching is Broken**  \\nI was laid off at the end of 2022, just months after being hired to lead a strategic initiative. The role was newly created, unbudgeted, and I was told it would be difficult. **Three months in, I had built momentum and developed a plan to nearly double revenue.** I was offered a promotion\u2026 then, weeks later, was told my role was being eliminated in a layoff.  \\n  \\nFor months, I followed every job search best practice:  \\n\u2714\ufe0f **Networking, referrals, personalized outreach**  \\n\u2714\ufe0f **Optimized resumes & LinkedIn profile with AI assistance**  \\n\u2714\ufe0f **Custom cover letters, keyword optimization, industry research**  \\n  \\n\ud83d\udca1 **The result?** A few great conversations but no viable offers. Recruiters kept telling me, **\"It\u2019s a tough job market,\" \"Things will pick up next quarter,\"** but nothing changed.  \\n  \\nBy September, I lowered my expectations significantly. I applied for **entry-level analyst and manager roles,** even in areas where I had built functions before. Still, I faced rejection\u2014often because hiring managers were skeptical about why I would want a \"lower\" position.   \\n  \\nRealizing I needed to upskill, I spent months **training to be a data analyst\u2014SQL, data visualization, the works.** I enjoyed it, but something became clear: **AI was already doing the job I was training for.**  \\n  \\n### **\ud83d\udd39 The AI-Driven Career Experiment Begins**  \\n\ud83d\udccc By February, after another month of failed job searching, I had to face reality:  \\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **The traditional job search wasn\u2019t working.** My network was stale, I had no social media presence, and a two-year employment gap made things worse.  \\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **The employment landscape will not improve.** AI is replacing white-collar jobs at an insane pace\u2014data analysts, customer service, financial analysts, creatives, and more. AI itself estimates it can replace **80-90%** of these roles.  \\n  \\nSo, I did what I had been doing for months\u2014I asked ChatGPT for advice. This AI knows **more about my career, skills, and job search than anyone.** It has helped with my resume iterations, job applications, networking strategies, and even alternative income ideas.  \\n  \\nFaced with limited time and resources, I fed AI **Y Combinator\u2019s 2025 investment targets** (nearly all focused on automating white-collar work) and asked:  \\n\ud83d\udccc **\"What should I do?\"**  \\n  \\nIt analyzed everything and gave me **two key recommendations:**  \\n\ud83d\udd39 **Learn AI automation\u2014use tools to optimize job searching and business processes, then share that journey.**  \\n\ud83d\udd39 **Try to monetize my dog on social media\u2014he has viral potential.**  \\n  \\nThat\u2019s when I realized: **Why not turn my future over to AI entirely? Not just learn it, but let it guide me back to generating income?**  \\n  \\n### **\ud83d\udd39 The AI Career Experiment: What Happens Next**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **1\ufe0f\u20e3 I will document my AI-driven job search and automation journey.**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **2\ufe0f\u20e3 I will apply AI to social media growth and business process automation.**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **3\ufe0f\u20e3 AI will determine how I allocate my time based on the response to this post and my dog\u2019s social media engagement.**  \\n  \\nIf AI is going to shape the future, I\u2019m embracing it fully.  \\n  \\n### **\ud83d\udd39 How You Can Help**  \\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you know of AI-driven roles where I can help companies adopt, implement, or optimize AI tools, let\u2019s talk.** I\u2019m open to starting over in salary\u2014getting back to work is my priority. My background aligns with:  \\n- **AI Implementation & Strategy** (AI Adoption Consultant, AI Transformation Lead)  \\n- **Business Intelligence & Data-Driven Strategy** (BI Manager, Strategy & Analytics Manager)  \\n- **Revenue & Growth Optimization** (Revenue Operations Analyst, AI-Driven Sales Enablement)  \\n  \\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Engage with this post.** Like, comment, or share\u2014it will help me reach the right people.  \\n  \\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you love dogs, check out Chewy\u2019s channels.** If AI is right and he does go viral, it could help sustain my family while I transition careers.  \\n  \\n\ud83d\udc36 **Follow The Wide Retriever:**  \\n\ud83d\udccd **Instagram:** [Insert IG handle]  \\n\ud83d\udccd **TikTok:** [Insert TikTok handle]  \\n\ud83d\udccd **YouTube Shorts:** [Insert YouTube handle]  \\n  \\n\ud83d\ude80 **This is an experiment in AI, career transformation, and content.** If you\u2019re interested in how AI is reshaping careers, follow along\u2014I\u2019ll be sharing everything I learn.  \\n  \\n\ud83d\udcac **Have you ever taken AI\u2019s career advice?
