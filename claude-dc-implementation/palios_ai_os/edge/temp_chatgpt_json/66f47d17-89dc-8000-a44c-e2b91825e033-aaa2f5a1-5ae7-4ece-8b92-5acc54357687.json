This was a sales and sales enablement function, so I revamped all sales processes and materials and trained a team to acheive those results, which is very direct. I don't think that the 2nd OJCommerce one is relevant because we didn't really have errors or track that in onboarding, it was more of speed thing which is reflected in the 12 to 300. At Mirakl, it was pretty heavily sales focused role. I trained the sales team and technical sales support team on the drop ship model and revamped their materials, language and overally value proposition communication with the marketing team, but not sure if that in particular would make it up to the top, but maybe reword that mirakl bullet to make it more aligned with the opportunity, like GTM, sales enablement, training, TAM calcs, etc. "], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1736644008.388821, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
