The last step is the Charter table structure. We do not need to define the strict update process now, but will be taking another look at the charter once we are ready to put my live data in and will lock it down technically so that it cannot be changed by anyone who uses the system. Let's do the charter table structure. For the overall guiding principle of the charter, the ultimate rules are that the goals and directions given cannot undermine humanity's expansion, there are no extinction goals allowed as an example. There will also need to be an ultimate rule of truth seeking with the well-being of humanity in mind. There will also be something in there that prevents it from being used for nefarious purposes. This is very hard to define, but I think the mutual exchange of goods and services (commerce) is something that would be broad enough. This requires a lot of thought for the language, but that is kind of how I'm thinking about it. How should we structure the table to allow for this type of set up along with the other constraints in the charter?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739668126.176712, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67b1122d-39fc-8000-ad48-778439e25bee"}}
