Given your background in establishing and growing partnerships in eCommerce and SaaS, as well as your deep experience in driving revenue through these channels, you are a strong match for this role. \n\nHere\u2019s how I think your **partnerships resume** compares to the job requirements and what you might highlight:\n\n### Key Alignment with the Role:\n1. **Partner Strategy & Execution:**\n   - The Vantage role requires developing and executing a partner strategy, particularly with cloud infrastructure providers. Your experience with partnership-driven sales revival (CommerceHub) and the development of key partnerships (e.g., Walmart, Google Shopping) shows a solid track record of forming high-value strategic partnerships and revenue-driving collaborations.\n   \n2. **Co-Marketing & Co-Selling:**\n   - Your experience at **Pollen Technologies** and **CommerceHub** with co-marketing initiatives\u2014webinars, joint marketing campaigns, and partner management\u2014would directly apply to Vantage's requirement to co-sell and run co-marketing campaigns with cloud infrastructure providers like AWS and Google Cloud.\n\n3. **Go-to-Market Strategies & Joint Sales Success:**\n   - Your ability to define and execute GTM strategies, as demonstrated in several of your past roles, particularly at CommerceHub and Pollen, fits well with the expectations of managing Vantage\u2019s partner program and driving joint sales efforts.\n\n4. **Technical Knowledge & Experience:**\n   - Vantage emphasizes cloud infrastructure and the technical understanding of the partner ecosystems (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). Your technical experience in leading **BI model automation at CommerceHub** and in other roles might help establish your credibility in collaborating with cloud infrastructure partners, though you may want to emphasize any technical interactions you\u2019ve had in your resume.\n   \n5. **First Partnership Role:**\n   - This is the first partnerships role at Vantage, which means there will likely be more autonomy and need for initiative. Your experience in building partnership ecosystems from scratch at places like Pollen and ESE Solutions demonstrates your ability to establish frameworks where none exist and drive growth from the ground up.\n\n### How You Could Adjust Your Resume for the Vantage Role:\n- **Focus on Cloud Infrastructure & Tech Partnerships**: Highlight any technical or infrastructure-related partnerships that you may have managed. You can emphasize that your partnership strategy at Pollen and CommerceHub involved deep technical integration and cross-functional collaborations, even if cloud providers weren\u2019t the main focus.\n  \n- **Showcase Ability to Build from Scratch**: Since Vantage is looking for someone to build and scale their first partnerships channel, make sure to emphasize your ability to start from nothing\u2014like your work in transforming vendor onboarding processes at OJCommerce or scaling partnerships at Pollen.\n\n- **Mention the Specific Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)**: Even if your past experience doesn\u2019t include direct interaction with these specific platforms, it may help to mention any familiarity or indirect involvement you had. It may also be helpful to highlight your ability to quickly get up to speed on these platforms due to your technical knowledge.\n\n- **Scalable Partner Process Implementation**: Emphasize this experience, such as at **Pollen Technologies** where you built scalable processes for partnerships and automation, which fits well with Vantage\u2019s requirement to scale their partnership channel.\n\n### Potential Additions or Revisions:\nYou might want to add more about your ability to manage **technical integrations** and **cross-functional execution**. This is particularly important when working with cloud service providers, as partnerships would likely involve deeper tech stack collaborations.\n\n---\n\nFor the email to the hiring manager:\n\n---\n\n**Subject: Excited About the Director of Channel & Alliances Role at Vantage**\n\nHi [Hiring Manager's Name],\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well.
