The fingerprint is just a short identifier for the key, not the key itself.\n\nTo set up SSH authentication with GitHub, you need your **public key**, typically located at:\n\n```\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Step-by-step to add your SSH public key to GitHub:**\n\n### **1. Display your SSH public key**  \n\nRun this in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n```\n\n- **This will display something like this (example only):**\n\n```\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCz.... user@yourmachine\n```\n\n- **Copy the entire line** (starting with `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Add SSH public key to GitHub:**\n\n- Open your GitHub account's SSH settings:\n  [https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)\n\n- Paste the copied public key into the **\"Key\"** field.\n- Add a descriptive name in the **\"Title\"** field (e.g., \"Claude DC SSH Key\").\n- Click **Add SSH key**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Test Your SSH Connection:**\n\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\n- You'll see a successful authentication message like:\n\n```\nHi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Now push your code via SSH:**\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **Note on the SHA256 Fingerprint (the one you mentioned):**  \n- The fingerprint (`SHA256:...`) is only a short identifier GitHub uses to confirm you're connecting with the correct SSH key. You don't paste that fingerprint anywhere.\n- Always paste the **full public key** (`ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`) into GitHub.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Summary (exactly what to do next):**\n- Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.\n- Paste that full key to GitHub\u2019s SSH key settings page.\n- Test connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`.\n- Push your commit with `git push -u origin main`.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what you need!
