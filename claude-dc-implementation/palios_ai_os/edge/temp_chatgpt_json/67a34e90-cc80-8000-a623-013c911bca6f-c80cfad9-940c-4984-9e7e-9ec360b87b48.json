Here\u2019s a version that reflects that AI-led transformation and gives Alon credit for being part of it:\n\n---\n\n**Hey Alon,**  \n\nWanted to check in before I post an update tomorrow\u2014because AI led me straight to you, and it\u2019s already paying off.  \n\nA week ago, my goal was to become an expert in AI implementation. **I had no idea how to get there.**  \n\nAI told me:  \n\u2714 Connect with thought leaders.  \n\u2714 Take on projects.  \n\u2714 Document everything.  \n\n**Following that plan has already changed everything.** Ferrazzi liked and commented on my post. Cold outreach led to real connections. And now I\u2019ve locked in a 60-hour weekly plan to see how far AI can take me.  \n\nThis is moving fast\u2014but that\u2019s how it happens, right? Would love any insights before I share tomorrow. Appreciate you, man.  \n\n---\n\nThis keeps it high-energy, ties in the success from following AI\u2019s plan, and makes him feel like part of the process.
