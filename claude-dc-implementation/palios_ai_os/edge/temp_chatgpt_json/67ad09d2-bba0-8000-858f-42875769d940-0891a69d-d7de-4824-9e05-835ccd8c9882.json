However, in some cases, **two-way relations** are useful if we expect frequent cross-referencing.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n| Table | Field | Relation Type | Reason |\n|--------|------------|---------------|------------|\n| **PKD** | Source | **One-Way** \u2192 Knowledge Vault | PKD should reference Knowledge Vault sources, but Knowledge Vault doesn\u2019t need to list every PKD entry referencing it. |\n| **AI Workflows** | Source | **One-Way** \u2192 Knowledge Vault | Workflows should reference sources, but we don\u2019t need every workflow listed in the Knowledge Vault. |\n| **AI Influencers** | Influence Source | **Two-Way** \u2194 Knowledge Vault | Thought leaders should be linked to their **books, interviews, research, and podcasts** for easy cross-referencing. |\n| **AI Research** | Source | **Two-Way** \u2194 Knowledge Vault | Research should be directly tied to the Knowledge Vault and vice versa, since research is often cited in multiple places. |\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Why This Works**\n\u2714 **One-Way:** Keeps PKD & Workflows clean. These are user-driven overrides, not research databases.  \n\u2714 **Two-Way:** AI Influencers and Research need **bi-directional** links to track where insights originated **and** where they are used.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Final Confirmation** before we implement this?  \nIf this structure is good, we\u2019ll **update Notion** with the new fields and ensure relationships are set up properly."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739613081.99821, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
