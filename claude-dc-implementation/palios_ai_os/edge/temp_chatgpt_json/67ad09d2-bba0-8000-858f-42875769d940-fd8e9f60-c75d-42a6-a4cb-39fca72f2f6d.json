Do you see RagMetrics being a fit for this, or would you recommend another setup for large-scale retrieval + automation? Would love your take!  \n\nThis keeps it **concise** while **framing it strategically**\u2014so he can tell us **if RagMetrics fits or recommend alternatives**.  \n\nWant to go with this version?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739574657.374554, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
