I'm going to be doing a post about my new data analyst/scientist career transition, but this one seemed effective:\n\n\nWe\u2019re probably going to lose the house we just bought and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\r\n- I was laid off 4 months ago when the bulk of my team was outsourced. (2 months after putting everything we had into buying a new home)\r\n- I\u2019ve applied to 400+ jobs. (Local, remote and even other areas we\u2019d be willing to move to.)\r\n- I\u2019ve tried a ton of different approaches. (Resume rebuilding, networking, paid searches, etc)\r\n\r\nMy entire career I feel like I\u2019ve been able to figure out how to get through any problem\u2026 but I can\u2019t figure this out. I\u2019ve never felt like more of a failure but I know that failure is the price we pay for success.\r\n\r\nIm ok with coming off as \u201cdesperate\u201d because I am. The only thing that\u2019s actionable is the truth. \r\n\r\nIf you know someone specifically that is hiring, please let me know.\r\n\r\n(Sorry about this post being a bummer. I promise I\u2019m usually a positive and borderline silly person. \ud83d\ude05)"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1730326498.604094, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
