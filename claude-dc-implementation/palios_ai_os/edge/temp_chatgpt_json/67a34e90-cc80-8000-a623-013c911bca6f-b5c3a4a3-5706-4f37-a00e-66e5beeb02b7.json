We ended up chatting a couple of times, and then *Never Eat Alone* happened.  \n\nFigured I\u2019d reach out again\u2014because I\u2019m about to take another big (and uncomfortable) swing.  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market faster than anyone is prepared for, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.  \n\nSo I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment\u2014leveraging AI to guide my next move, automate the job search, and rethink work itself.  \n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.
