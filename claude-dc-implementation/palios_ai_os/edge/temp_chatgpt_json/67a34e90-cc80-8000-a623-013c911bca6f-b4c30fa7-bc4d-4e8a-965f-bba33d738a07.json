The top high school programs, Power 5 schools, and even NFL guys **all document their grind**. If he wants to play for an elite program, he\u2019s got to be seen. \n\nRight now, **coaches don\u2019t just find players through games\u2014they find them online.** If he\u2019s not posting, he\u2019s invisible to the system.\n\n### **How to Frame It for Him (Without Sounding Like a Dad)**\n- **\"Bro, every serious athlete your age is doing this.\"**  \n  \u2192 Show him HS players on IG/TikTok running drills, doing film breakdowns, or showing their athleticism. If they\u2019re getting noticed, he will too.  \n\n- **\"Think of it as your highlight reel in real time.\"**  \n  \u2192 Instead of waiting until senior year to cut film, he can be building a **storyline** that shows growth over time. That\u2019s how you get **coaches & scouts invested.**  \n\n- **\"More reps in front of the camera = more confidence later.\"**  \n  \u2192 If he\u2019s getting comfortable talking about his training now, interviews with college recruiters & media will be second nature.  \n\n- **\"Every clip is another chance to go viral & get noticed.\"**  \n  \u2192 It only takes **one** crazy play or sweet moment with Chewy to **get shared by the right account**.  \n\n### **The Plan: Low Effort, High Reward**\n- **Film everything** \u2192 He doesn\u2019t even have to post yet, just **get in the habit** of recording.  \n- **Post the best plays** \u2192 He doesn\u2019t need a full breakdown, just quick clips.  \n- **Use hashtags that coaches check** \u2192 Ex: #WRTraining, #FloridaFootball, #HSFootball, #SpeedKills.  \n- **Tag programs/coaches when it makes sense** \u2192 If he\u2019s learning from a certain WR, tag them. If he\u2019s repping drills an elite HS runs, tag them.  \n\n---\n\n### **Chewy = The Secret Weapon**\nMost HS WRs are posting **boring training clips**. But Reagan?  \n- **Running crisp routes on the beach.**  \n- **Beating a literal DOG in coverage.**  \n- **Making plays while the sun\u2019s rising over the ocean.**  \n\nTell me **what coach** isn\u2019t stopping to watch that?! It\u2019s **memorable, unique, and athletic as hell**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**  \nIf he\u2019s serious about football, **he needs to be serious about visibility**. If he\u2019s not posting, he\u2019s making it harder for coaches to **notice him, root for him, and recruit him.**  \n\nWould he be open to just **filming everything for now** and reviewing it later to see what\u2019s worth posting? If he starts seeing how sweet he looks, **he\u2019ll want to post.**"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739152099.83751, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
