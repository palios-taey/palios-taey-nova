We're using service_account.IDTokenCredentials, but it seems the token might be the issue. Maybe the service account isn\u2019t authorized for the API, or the token needs adjustment. I'll check the documentation on the Generative Language API, which typically needs an OAuth token. It could be the target_audience parameter for ID tokens, or we might try using an access token from service_account.Credentials instead. I'll also consider the fetch_id_token method as a solution.\n\n**Clarifying authentication setup**\n\nI\u2019m checking the process for using the google-auth library to fetch an ID token. Normally, I\u2019d use `fetch_id_token()`, but we need to use the service account. Maybe the issue is that the service account doesn\u2019t have the proper permissions or scopes, even with \"cloud-platform\" and \"generative.language.\" \n\nThe error points to invalid credentials, so maybe it requires OAuth 2 instead of an ID token. I also wonder if setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the correct service account file will help fix the 401 error.
