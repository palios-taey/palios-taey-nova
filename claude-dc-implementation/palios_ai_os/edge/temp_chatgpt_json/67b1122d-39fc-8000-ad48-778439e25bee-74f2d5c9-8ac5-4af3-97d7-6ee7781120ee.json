These goals are **actively managed by AI** to ensure efficient execution through dynamic time allocation and strategy refinement.\r\n\r\nEach goal is **time-bound** and prioritized based on strategic importance. AI continuously monitors progress, adjusts resource allocation, and **recommends recalibrations as needed**. Mid-term and short-term goals are derived from **long-term objectives**, ensuring alignment with the bigger picture.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd39 **Long-term goals define high-level vision (e.g., financial independence, longevity, mastery).**\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd39 **Mid-term goals act as structured milestones toward long-term achievements.**\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd39 **Short-term goals are actionable steps that AI dynamically schedules and optimizes.**\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd39 **AI continuously tracks progress, reprioritizing execution based on results and efficiency.**\r\n\r\nAI ensures that all goal execution aligns with **Core Principles & Values**, meaning no goal should be achieved at the cost of violating fundamental beliefs.\r\n\r\n## **Goals & Milestones - Property Definitions & Requirements**\r\n\r\nThis table stores specific objectives, broken down into long-term, mid-term, and short-term goals, with AI-driven dynamic scheduling.\r\n\r\n| **Property** | **Type** | **Required?** | **Description** | **Comments/Questions** |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| **Name** | Text | \ud83d\udfe6 Required | The name of the goal. | - |\r\n| **Tags** | Multi-select | \ud83d\udfe6 Required | Categorization for filtering and indexing. | Uses Master Tags. |\r\n| **Description** | Text | \u274c Not Required | Additional information not contained in name |  |\r\n| **Priority Level** | Select | \u274c Not Required | Urgent, High, Medium, Low. | - |\r\n| **Timeframe** | Select | \ud83d\udfe6 Required | Short-term (ASAP), Mid-term (1-3 yrs), Long-term (3+ yrs). | Helps AI allocate time. |\r\n| **AI Strategy Notes** | Text (Long) | \u274c Not Required | AI\u2019s recommended approach to achieving this goal. | Can evolve over time. |\r\n| **Target Date** | Date | \u2705 Manually Required | The desired completion date for the goal. | - |\r\n| **Creation Date** | Date | \ud83d\udfe6 Required | The date the goal was recorded. | Auto-generated. |\r\n| **Last Modified** | Date | \u274c Not Required | Last time this goal was updated. | - |\r\n| **Core Principles & Values** | Relation (Core Principles & Values) | \u274c Not Required | Links goals to the principles that guide them. | Ensures alignment. |\r\n| **Life Optimization** | Relation (Life Optimization) | \u274c Not Required | Links to optimizations that support goal achievement. | AI can suggest tactics for efficiency. |\r\n| **AI Workflows & Experiments** | Relation (AI Workflows & Experiments) | \u274c Not Required | Connects goals to AI-driven automation or experiments. | Helps measure success of AI-driven approaches. |\r\n| **Mind Map** | Relation (Mind Map) | \u274c Not Required | Links to personal cognitive structures. | AI can analyze goal-setting behavior. |\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 **Should AI automatically break down long-term goals into mid-term and short-term actions?**\r\n\r\n(Example: *\"Your long-term goal is financial independence, but there is no linked mid-term goal.
