Since the script is within `src/dashboard/`, Python doesn't see `src` as a package.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Fix:\n\nNavigate to the root directory (`claude-dc-implementation`) and run your script using Python's module invocation:\n\n```bash\ncd /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation\npython3 -m src.dashboard.bach_router\n```\n\nThis tells Python explicitly where the root of your package (`src`) is located, and it resolves imports correctly.\n\n---\n\n### Permanent Solution:\nIf you prefer to execute scripts directly without the module invocation, add this at the top of your script (above all local imports):\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Adjust path so src is in PYTHONPATH\ncurrent_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent\nsrc_dir = current_dir.parent.parent\nsys.path.insert(0, str(src_dir))\n```\n\nThis snippet temporarily adds the project's root (`claude-dc-implementation`) to your `PYTHONPATH`, allowing direct script execution.\n\nWith this fix, you can run directly again with:\n\n```bash\npython3 src/dashboard/bach_router.py\n```\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps for Context:\n1. **Apply one of the above solutions** (preferably the quick fix first for immediate testing).\n2. **Run the script again and confirm that no import errors occur**.\n3. **Share the output with me**\u2014that will provide me additional context to suggest clear, actionable next steps toward your broader goal without creating an overly rigid plan.\n\nLet\u2019s get this fixed first, then we'll build from there."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743648196.504387, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
