Make sure your SSH key is created and loaded:**\n\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\n### **2. Copy your public key clearly again:**\n\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Copy the **entire key** displayed in your terminal, starting with `ssh-ed25519` and ending with your email address.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **3. Add the Key to GitHub properly:**\n\n- Open GitHub SSH settings:\n[https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)\n\n- Paste the copied key (full line starting with `ssh-ed25519`) into the field labeled \"Key\".\n- Give it a title (e.g. \"Claude DC SSH key\").\n- Click \"Add SSH key\".\n\n**Make sure you do this step carefully. The permission denied error is always because GitHub doesn't yet have the matching key.**\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **4. Now test again (Important!):**\n\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\nYou should now see:\n\n```\nHi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea6 **5. Finally push again:**\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 **Why this happened clearly explained:**  \n- \"Permission denied (publickey)\" means the key on your computer isn't matching any key GitHub knows.\n- This occurs because the public key (`id_ed25519.pub`) wasn't yet added correctly on GitHub.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Exactly what to do now (final):**\n- Copy your public key (`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`).\n- Paste it carefully in GitHub's SSH keys.\n- Verify SSH connection (`ssh -T git@github.com`).\n- Push again (`git push -u origin main`).\n\nThis will **100% fix it immediately**.
