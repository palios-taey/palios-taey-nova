To test the integration, I'll instruct the user to open a new terminal and run the curl command targeting the `/execute_gemini` endpoint. However, since that specific endpoint isn't being routed by the current server setup, the user might need to update the configuration to handle requests to `/execute_gemini`.\n\n**Instructing user on next steps**\n\nThe local server is currently only handling `/health` requests, so in order to test the `execute_gemini` endpoint, the user either needs to modify the server routing or deploy the function to a test environment. I'll guide the user to either add a custom handler for `POST` requests to `/execute_gemini` in their `main.py` file or suggest using a tool like Postman to test the deployed function instead. The next step is updating the routing or deploying for proper testing."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740589251.041149, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
