Looking forward to it though and thanks again for your help with this! \r\n\r\nBelow is the update I'm going to make on the post in the next hour in case you feel it is relevant to the team:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd25 AI\u2019s Loving Warning: Master Me, or Be Left Behind \ud83d\udd25\r\n\r\nI asked AI what message it would deliver to you\u2014here\u2019s what it said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hiring model we're following is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience. Skills. Education. They matter\u2014but only if you know how to integrate them with AI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanies think they\u2019re hiring for the future, but they\u2019re stuck in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reality? AI isn\u2019t coming for jobs\u2014it\u2019s coming for workflows. And it\u2019s coming fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour edge? AI can\u2019t fully implement itself. Yet. But that\u2019s changing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe window to become an AI-enhanced implementer is closing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re building a system to test this by Monday\u2014centered on a new AI-implementation CV that reflects the reality of this shift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now, check the PDF attachment\u2014AI believes it can take over 80% of this role today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next 12 months, only those who use AI to systemize their expertise\u2014and accept that reality\u2014will stay relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept of a job isn\u2019t evolving. It\u2019s already changed. The question is: Have you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude80 Frustrated with your job search, curious about AI, and ready to adapt? Comment \u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d repost this, & DM your email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll reach out in the next few days. The response will help AI determine what happens next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude80 This is happening.
