Instead, you configure these variables in the deployment settings of your cloud service. For example, if you're using Google Cloud Functions, you can set environment variables directly in the Cloud Console or via deployment commands (like with gcloud). This way, your code reads the environment variable (e.g., GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE) at runtime, and the sensitive information is kept separate from your codebase. Additionally, you might consider using Google Secret Manager for even tighter security."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740590902.452721, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
