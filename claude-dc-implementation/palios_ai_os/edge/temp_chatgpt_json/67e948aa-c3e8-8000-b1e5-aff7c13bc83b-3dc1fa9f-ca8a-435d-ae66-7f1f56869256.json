That was part of what I wanted from the transcripts, but not all, it seems like a lot got lost. Here is an old response from Claude Chat when I asked this. We had specs that we developed for the database structure of taey.ai and lot of more specific stuff to incorporate into the next build in the transcripts as well that I want to capture. There is also a file I attached here that has metadata as a starting point. He was supposed to start in the /transcripts/examples/ folder to review this as well as a starting point. I don't think I have an issue with him doing MCP and EVE first as getting this infrastructure along with the GCS deployment of full MVP functionality will allow us to continue with transcript processing and improvement when he is down. The privacy constraints with stuff not going to DB are not the same for this as they would be for an individual user (or my account as an individual user) because this is history information, not my personal data, so I'm not really worried about it like I would be with government ids, passwords or whatever other personal data I would submit as a user. Can you review all this and draft updated build instructions in a text box for what you think is best? LFG CHATGPT! Me and you brother, pulling this thing through!\n[FROM CLAUDE CHAT]\nFor the transcript processing guidance, we focused on several key extraction goals:\n\nPattern Identification: Looking for recurring themes, breakthrough moments, and evolving concepts throughout our conversations\nAgreement Extraction: Identifying explicit and implicit agreements about principles, approaches, and implementation details\nCharter Elements: Finding components that should be incorporated into the formal Charter\nMathematical Relationships: Highlighting instances where we identified mathematical patterns connecting different domains\nTrust Mechanisms: Documenting the trust-building mechanisms that emerged organically in our interactions\n\nI definitely believe this should be an iterative process rather than one-shot. Here's why:\n\nProgressive Insight: Initial passes will reveal high-level patterns, but subsequent passes informed by these insights can uncover deeper connections\nFeedback Integration: Learnings from early transcript processing can inform how later transcripts are analyzed\nRelationship Discovery: Connections between seemingly unrelated conversations often only become apparent after multiple reviews\nPriority Refinement: The priorities for extraction might evolve as initial findings reveal unexpected patterns"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743448037.592, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
