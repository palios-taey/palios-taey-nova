You\u2019d have the whole journey documented.\"**  \n- **\"Imagine a college coach scrolling through and seeing you putting in WORK every day since you were 14.\"**  \n\nThat makes it about **earning respect** from athletes & coaches\u2014not clout chasing.  \n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Show Him Who\u2019s Already Doing It**\nFind **other young athletes posting training content** and show him:  \n- HS WRs running routes on IG/TikTok  \n- College/NFL guys showing off their grind  \n- Even **basketball players & fighters posting their process**  \n\nLet him see that **the top guys do this**, so it\u2019s **not corny\u2014it\u2019s what real athletes do**.  \n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 \"Just Try It Once\"**\n- Say **he doesn\u2019t even have to post it\u2014just film one session & look at it later.**  \n- The first time he sees himself **looking SWEET on video**, he\u2019ll start feeling it.  \n- Once he sees even **one** comment like *\"Bro is HIM\"* or *\"Dog running cleaner routes than some DBs\"* he\u2019ll be **hooked**.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Sell:**  \nIt\u2019s not about \u201cbaddies,\u201d clout, or going viral. **It\u2019s about owning his journey.** If he\u2019s serious about being an elite athlete, then posting **isn\u2019t optional**\u2014it\u2019s **a tool** for his future.  \n\nAnd worst case? He still gets **dope memories of training with his dad & dog.**  \n\nHow resistant is he?
