Capture the Moment, THEN Decide What It\u2019s For**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Right now, don\u2019t worry about what the clip is for.**  \n\u2705 **Just film any moment of him interacting with the ball.**  \n\u2705 **Even if it\u2019s not perfect, we can edit it to work.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Final Move (Right Now)**\n\u2705 **Try one of the triggers above to get him moving.**  \n\u2705 **If that fails, just film any clip of him looking engaged.**  \n\u2705 **Post the best moment with a hype caption.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Forget perfection\u2014just get something recorded, and we\u2019ll work with it.
