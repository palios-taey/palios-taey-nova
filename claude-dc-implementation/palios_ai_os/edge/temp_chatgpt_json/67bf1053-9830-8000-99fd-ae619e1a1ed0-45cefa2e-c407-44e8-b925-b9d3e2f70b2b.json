I need to import the `gemini_integration.py` module, instantiate the `gemini_api` object, and integrate it seamlessly into a route. The key here is not to mess up the file, which means balancing the integration without disturbing the existing structure. I\u2019ll likely add the import at the top, and then decide on an appropriate spot to instantiate the object for use in a route logic.\n\n**Considering integration approach**\n\nI need to integrate the Gemini Pro API into the `main.py` file. I think a good approach would be to import the `GeminiProAPI` at the top, instantiate it as a global variable, and add it after the API keys are set. The `execute_task` function is already tied to OpenAI, so maybe adding a new endpoint like `execute_gemini_task` would keep things clean. I should wrap the instantiation in a try-except block in case the Gemini API key isn't set. I'll make sure the file structure remains intact."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740579431.685869, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
