Since the **original discussion is happening in the comments**, a repost only makes sense if you frame it differently\u2014maybe making it **less about responding to him specifically and more about your broader AI thesis**.\n\nIf you **do** repost, make it punchy and open-ended, something like:\n\n> **The shift is happening fast. Feels like we\u2019re moving from 5 PMs and 8 engineers to just 1 managing AI for both.**\n>  \n> What happens when AI isn\u2019t just accelerating product management\u2014but **fully owning** it?  \n>  \n> Are we ready for that?

If not, a **well-framed repost** might kickstart fresh discussion.
