This suggests the issue is with how we're trying to use it. I remember that the 'google-auth' library has 'google.oauth2.service_account.IDTokenCredentials'. I'll check the official docs to confirm. Yep, it should be from the 'service_account' module! So, I'll update the code to import 'service_account' and use the correct method:\n\n```\ncredentials = service_account.IDTokenCredentials.from_service_account_file(\n            service_account_file, target_audience=TARGET_AUDIENCE\n        )\n```"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740593407.222775, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
