It would be great to be able to process social media updates for these in real time, even for Chewy stuff of top influencers, but also any useful information from tweets and linkedin posts. Is that something that is needed in the database or something that can be found automatically? We should be conducting Deep Research on all these in here. Is there a way to link that? Store separately? If something we can handle later, then fine, but just want you to be mindful of it. I do that a lot, I tell you something not now, but for later, do you need a separate table for those things or is there another way to handle? Like to remember when we say we're going to re-address something at a certain time in the future, either event or date based?\nCore Goals and Principles - kept Description, Timeframe, AI Strategy Notes, Type (Principle, Goal)\n\nAI Workflows - Have Creation Date and Last Modified\nLife Optimization - Created and Last Modified Dates, AI Tools Used, Description, Optimization Plan, Implementation Status, Results Analysis (text for post mortem should this be included anywhere else?), Result (Below Expectations, Met Expectations, Exceeded Expectations)\n\nI have not added any tags, I'm assuming we would want the same Tags accessible between a lot of the Tag feilds, is there a way to do that? Or will they just have to be maintained separately. Let me know your thoughts, then I can make any final adjustments and send over to you for confirmation.
