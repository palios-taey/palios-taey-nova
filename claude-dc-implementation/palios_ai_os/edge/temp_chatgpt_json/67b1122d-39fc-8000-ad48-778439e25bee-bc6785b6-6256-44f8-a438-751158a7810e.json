I will do it as you instructed the 2nd time now. While I'm doing that, take some time to diagnose this issue and update in real time to make sure it doesn't happen again and that you don't go too fast and skip steps in instructions. I need you to relay accurate information to me. We all know you can go fast, but you can't sacrifice quality, once you get the quality down, you will be able to go as fast as you want. I'm updating the file now, you fix on your end and I'll let you know the result. Don't just say you're going to fix this mistake, actually do it and take the time to dig deep if needed and fix whatever needs to be fixed. More broadly, your prioritization of speed is creating a lot of quality issues. You seem to have too much of a priority on speed while you are in learning mode. Just an observation to consider.
