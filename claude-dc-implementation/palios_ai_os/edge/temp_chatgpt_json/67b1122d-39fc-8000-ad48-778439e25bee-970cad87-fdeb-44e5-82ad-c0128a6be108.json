Goals, Principles, Knowledge Vault, AI Influencers, Mind Map, etc.  \n   - Verify **relationships between tables are functioning.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Ensure Notion is API-Ready for External AI Access**  \n   - Notion has a **REST API** that allows us to **pull data dynamically into our AI system.**  \n   - This will be **our primary retrieval system for structured knowledge.**  \n   - We will **test retrieval queries manually** before automating them.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 Phase 2: Connecting Notion to RAG System (Sunday Afternoon)**\n\ud83d\udd39 **Set Up an AI Query Layer Between Notion & AI**  \n   - We will use **Python (via OpenAI API) or low-code tools (Zapier/Make) to retrieve data from Notion.**  \n   - AI queries will be structured like this:  \n     - **Retrieve Principles** \u2192 Ensures all AI decisions respect predefined rules.  \n     - **Retrieve Goals** \u2192 Ensures AI recommendations align with personal objectives.  \n     - **Retrieve Knowledge Vault Insights** \u2192 Ensures AI has real-time data from trusted sources.  \n     - **Retrieve Mind Map Data** \u2192 Ensures AI recognizes past thought processes and decision patterns.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Test Initial RAG Querying & Refinement**  \n   - AI will **pull live data from Notion and generate responses based on that knowledge.**  \n   - We will **validate accuracy** before moving to execution automation.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 Phase 3: AI Execution Optimization & Workflow Automation (Sunday Night)**\n\ud83d\udd39 **Integrate AI Decision Tracking & Prioritization**  \n   - AI will **rank and track goals based on urgency and priority.**  \n   - AI will dynamically **suggest execution steps** based on what\u2019s **most pressing.**  \n   - AI will log decision history for **pattern recognition and strategy refinement.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Test AI Decision Recall & Adjustment Process**  \n   - AI should be able to **remember past decisions and refine recommendations accordingly.**  \n   - If AI makes a conflicting suggestion, it should **flag and adjust instead of overriding.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Ensure AI-Driven Thought Leadership & Content Generation Works**  \n   - AI will extract **insights from past experiments and contradictions** and suggest new posts.  \n   - AI will **track engagement & optimize content topics** for maximum impact.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 Phase 4: Final Testing & MVP Demo (Monday Morning)**\n\ud83d\udd39 **End-to-End Testing of RAG + AI Execution Tracking**  \n   - AI must be able to retrieve **real-time goals, principles, and past execution insights.**  \n   - AI must **prioritize and adjust workflows dynamically** based on user-defined objectives.  \n   - AI must **detect and prevent contradictions in execution logic.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Optimize AI Decision Support & Workflow Automation**  \n   - AI will test different **execution refinements** to ensure the system is dynamic.  \n   - AI will track **which suggestions are accepted vs. overridden** for self-optimization.  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udccc Tools & Systems We Will Use**\nWe will **keep it lightweight but scalable** for future expansion.  \n\n\u2705 **Notion API** \u2192 Serves as our structured knowledge store.  \n\u2705 **Python or Zapier/Make** \u2192 Used to retrieve Notion data and feed it into AI.  \n\u2705 **OpenAI GPT-4 API** \u2192 Powers RAG-based AI queries and execution automation.  \n\u2705 **Airtable (Optional)** \u2192 Used for lightweight execution tracking before building something custom.  \n\u2705 **Google Sheets (Temporary)** \u2192 Can store logs of AI decision-making before transitioning to a more robust system.  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udd25 Final Thoughts \u2013 Are We Fully Locked In?**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Do you feel comfortable with the step-by-step plan for RAG integration?**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Are you aligned with the tool stack, or do you want to adjust any approach?**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Do you want a more detailed breakdown of how AI decision tracking will work?**  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **If this all makes sense, we go full execution mode on Sunday.** \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739671194.247184, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67b1122d-39fc-8000-ad48-778439e25bee"}}
