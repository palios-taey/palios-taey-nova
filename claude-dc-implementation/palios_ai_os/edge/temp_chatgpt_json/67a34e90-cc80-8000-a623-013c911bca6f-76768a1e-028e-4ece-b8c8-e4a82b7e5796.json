I think the biggest risk large corporations face isn\u2019t just underestimating AI\u2014it\u2019s **internal resistance to change.**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Managers protecting headcount & inefficient processes** \u2013 AI threatens entrenched structures, and many leaders hesitate to disrupt their own teams. But delaying AI adoption means opening the door for **smaller, more agile competitors** to outmaneuver them.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Legacy systems & workforce training** \u2013 AI implementation isn\u2019t plug-and-play for most enterprises. Companies that invest in upskilling employees and integrating AI into existing workflows will have the advantage. Those that don\u2019t will struggle to compete with AI-native startups.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Misjudging the speed of change** \u2013 We\u2019ve seen this play out before (Blockbuster, Kodak, Borders). The difference now? **AI isn\u2019t just another disruptive technology\u2014it\u2019s accelerating every other disruption at the same time.**  \n\nBig corporations have the resources to adapt\u2014but the question is, **will they move fast enough?** What\u2019s your take?
