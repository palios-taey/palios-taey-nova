Since time is tight, let\u2019s **focus on speed and volume.** \n\n### **Execution Plan (FASTEST way to get this done)**\n1. **Open LinkedIn Messages in a separate tab.**  \n   - Open 10-15 conversations at a time in **new tabs** so you don\u2019t lose time clicking back and forth.  \n   - You can do this by **Ctrl + Click (Windows) or Cmd + Click (Mac).**  \n\n2. **Copy-Paste Message Format:**  \n   - Just swap the first name.  \n   - Keep everything else **exactly the same** for efficiency.  \n   - Example:\n\n   **Hey [Name],**  \n   Hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).  \n\n   I\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it\u2019s been brutal. AI is completely upending the job market, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.  \n\n   So tomorrow morning at **8:30 AM ET**, I\u2019m launching an **AI career transformation experiment** on LinkedIn\u2014and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.  \n\n   A reshare, comment, or even just a like would **make a huge difference** in helping it reach the right people.  \n\n   I\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!  \n\n   Appreciate it, [Name]. Thanks!  \n   **\u2014 Jesse**  \n\n3. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts to Fly Through Messages:**\n   - **Ctrl + V (Cmd + V on Mac) to paste.**\n   - **Tab + Enter** to send.\n   - Close tab, move to the next.\n\n4. **Track Progress:**  \n   - If you have **50+ to send, do them in chunks of 10-15 at a time** so you don\u2019t burn out.  \n   - If needed, use a **Google Doc or Notes app** to track who you\u2019ve messaged.\n\n5. **If Someone Responds:**  \n   - **Do not engage in long convos now.**  \n   - Just reply:  \n     *\"Appreciate it! Will send you the link when it\u2019s live tomorrow morning.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **Goal:**  \n- **50-100 messages in the next 90 minutes.**\n- **Make sure top contacts are hit first.**\n- **Be done before 7 PM so you can focus on prep for the morning.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n- Are there **any last-minute high-value people** (like recruiters or influencers) who should get a more personalized version?  \n- If yes, do **those 3-5 first** before batching out the rest.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Let\u2019s GO!** This is the final push before launch\u2014lock in and power through."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739226154.218145, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
