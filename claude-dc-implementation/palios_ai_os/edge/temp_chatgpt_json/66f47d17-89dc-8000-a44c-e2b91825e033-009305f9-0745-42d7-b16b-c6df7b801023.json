He is a 70 lb labradoodle with a Mohawk and catches a football that I throw like 20-30 yards on the beach. People ask to play and take pictures and videos of him all the time. In our area, there are lots of people with dogs and they like to hang out and drink. Since this property has a yard and tiki hut in the back, I have an idea to make it a doggie beach bar. So it would be dog friendly so people could just bring their dogs there to play and hang out inside or at tiki bar. It would be called Chewys Doggy Beach Bar or something after my dog and I think we could drive a lot of attention through social media due to his unique talents. What do you think?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727666080.213488, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
