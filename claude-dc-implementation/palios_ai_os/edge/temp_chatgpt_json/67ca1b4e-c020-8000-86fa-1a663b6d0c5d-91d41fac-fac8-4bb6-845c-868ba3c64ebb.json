All the code I've ever written, except some like basic HTLM stuff, I had my own business so was pretty good at connecting technologies and getting people to build stuff for me. I've used Mac and PCs, nothing Linux. Just nothing hardcore. That and this project, but everything technical has been done by your guys. \n\nThat's where I'm at. In your analysis, I ALSO need you to take into consideration my learning curve for anything that won't come easy for me. Like I don't know about Ubuntu at all, never heard of it. If it's something I can pick up quickly, then I'll do it, but if it's going to take, I don't know, more than a day for you guys to get me up to speed on it, then we can talk about, but I need you to consider that and get us there in less than a day.
