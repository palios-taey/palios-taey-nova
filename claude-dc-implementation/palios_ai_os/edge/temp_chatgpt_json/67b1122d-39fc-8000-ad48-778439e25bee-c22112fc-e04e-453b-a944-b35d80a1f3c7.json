I need to be able to stop you to avoid wasted time. I want to SEE what you're talking about, I want to look at it with you and be able to read it because I can read faster and then tell you 'looks good' so we can move faster. It is worth taking some time now to get the first batch of data in as clean and structured as it can possibly be because that will have compounding returns. So, can you show me or make an interface where you can present to me and I can read and see what you're talking about.
