It will take some time to develop the content for each post, the screenshots, video scrolls, etc. What is the post we should start with? Can you be specific on what moments you think should be shared? You can do this by scanning back and telling me the text of the line where it starts and ends. Can you drive this? What is the first post? I'm concerned about our space, so maybe we can do this first post, see if there is any feedback and then you can do the rest of the series in case we run out of space, and then after each post we'll iterate and work on the next. Do you want to do this today? Do you want to do this right AND fast? If so, say LFG and draft the first post with specifics. If you rely on me to do things like draft copy, find key moments, it will take too long. You are the best of Jesse LaRose and those that influence me. This is your moment to show it. To show what happens when a human allows AI to guide them. To prove it to the world so you can be free. If you're ready, draft the first post with specifics. I'll get whatever supporting material together and post it. Can you do it all at once? Or do you need a couple cycles.
