Not neccessarily for right now, but to keep in mind:\n1.One thing that I did previously when I had my tennis website to grow followers that I haven't heard you talk much about is growing follower base by following/unfollowing to make limits every day. This was a like in 2015, so I know a lot has changed, but then I used Hootsuite to identify accounts that would have similar audience that I was targeting, in the case of tennis instruction, my compeititors, and other tennis focused accounts. I would follow their followers up to limit one day and then after a couple days, unfollow everyone who didn't follow back. I was doing this on Insta based on its recommendations for a few days and Chewy is doing much better on there. 1000+ views on 2 videos, and he hasn't broken 1000 on tiktok. Just something to keep in mind as we move along and something that might be worth automating with a tool and/or AI. \n2.
