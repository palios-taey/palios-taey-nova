I think getting X ready with first post is next, then planning to go viral on LinkedIn (if it doesn't go viral, then none of automation is needed), then managing and fanning viral along with content for first post. I think we need to understand limits on LinkedIn for DMs/pre-outreach to plan accordingly and so I can handle certain engagement differently (text/email) to handle pre-launch effectively. It is also important to have other social channels set up in a credible way so that I'll get followers from the LinkedIn post as the other platforms do not have relevant followers that will drive engagement and reach at this time. And yes, if you agree that Chewy is sweet and should be featured in video, then let's do that. \n\nFor X first post, I do think that something very similar to LinkedIn in potentially thread format would be best, but I don't know. I think we can probably re-incorporate some of which needed to be cut, like the Singularity discussion because there seems to be a lot of AI talk (probably because that is what I'm clicking into on X) and comments around how AI is going to take over everything, CTOs saying they are done with junior/mid-level coders and analysts, etc."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739118393.764498, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
