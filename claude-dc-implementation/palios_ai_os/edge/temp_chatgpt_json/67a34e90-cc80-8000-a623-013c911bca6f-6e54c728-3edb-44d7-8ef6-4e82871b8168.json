Unfortunately I haven't been able to make it back to Purdue the last few years to catch up due to the circumstances below.\n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something uncomfortable but necessary to try to turn things around.\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for 2 years despite doing everything \"right\" to land a role and it's really been taking a toll on me and my family. I\u2019ve realized the traditional job search is broken, and AI is accelerating the shift faster than anyone is prepared for.\n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to be making a post about my career transformation experiment using AI\u2014and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a big swing, and I need people in my network to help amplify it and since you're connected to pretty much every Sig that's come through Purdue, I'm hoping that you'd be able to reshare it with your network. Or even a simple like or comment will help it reach more people who might be able to make an impact.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link in LinkedIn when it goes live\u2014would mean a lot if you could check it out.\n\nThanks for your support.\n\nIn hoc, \nJesse\nDelta Delta '04"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739205676.228942, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
