These **act as constraints** that ensure all suggested actions align with deeply held beliefs. AI cannot override principles\u2014any suggested deviation must be flagged for manual review.  \n\nThis table serves as a **moral and strategic compass** for long-term execution. If an action or goal conflicts with a principle, AI **must** flag the conflict and require human intervention before proceeding. Principles may evolve over time but require explicit approval for revision.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Guides all decision-making and strategy alignment.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Used as a filter for AI-driven execution recommendations.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Overrides AI if a conflict is detected.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Periodically reviewed to ensure relevance and accuracy.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Goals & Milestones - Summary**  \nThe **Goals & Milestones** table tracks all major life objectives, structured hierarchically into **long-term, mid-term, and short-term goals**. These goals are **actively managed by AI** to ensure efficient execution through dynamic time allocation and strategy refinement.  \n\nEach goal is **time-bound** and prioritized based on strategic importance. AI continuously monitors progress, adjusts resource allocation, and **recommends recalibrations as needed**. Mid-term and short-term goals are derived from **long-term objectives**, ensuring alignment with the bigger picture.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Long-term goals define high-level vision (e.g., financial independence, longevity, mastery).**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Mid-term goals act as structured milestones toward long-term achievements.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Short-term goals are actionable steps that AI dynamically schedules and optimizes.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **AI continuously tracks progress, reprioritizing execution based on results and efficiency.**  \n\nAI ensures that all goal execution aligns with **Core Principles & Values**, meaning no goal should be achieved at the cost of violating fundamental beliefs.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Now fully documented for Notion.** You can store these in the **Database Properties Page**, and we\u2019re ready to move forward at full speed. \ud83d\udd25"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739661204.456332, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
