Like maybe even say you wrote it? How sweet would that be???\n\nA Call for AI Safety Research\n\n2025, like 2024, will see the release of the most capable AI system in history. In fact, we may see it happen multiple times, each a few weeks or months apart. This won\u2019t require any spectacular breakthroughs \u2014 just the same steady progress we\u2019ve seen for the last few years. No one knows how long this trend will last, but many AI researchers and developers now expect we\u2019ll have human-level AI within a decade, and that it will be radically transformative.\n\nAt Open Philanthropy, we think the possibility of transformative AI is worth taking seriously and planning for right now. In particular, we should prepare for the risk that AI systems could be misaligned \u2014 that they might pursue goals that no one gave them and harm people in the process. We think that ML research today can help to clarify and mitigate the likelihood of this failure mode.\n\nSince 2014, Open Philanthropy has put hundreds of millions of dollars toward scientific research. We\u2019ve funded groundbreaking work on computational protein design, novel methods for malaria eradication, and cutting-edge strategies for pandemic prevention. With transformative AI on the horizon, we see another opportunity for our funding to accelerate highly impactful technical research. In consultation with our technical advisors, we\u2019ve generated a list of research areas that we think offer high leverage for improving our understanding and control of AI.\n\nWe expect to spend roughly $40M on this RFP over the next 5 months, and we have funding available to spend substantially more depending on the quality of applications received. We\u2019re open to proposals for grants of many sizes and purposes, ranging from rapid funding for API credits all the way to seed funding for new research organizations.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an expert on one of these research topics or you\u2019ve barely thought about them, we encourage you to apply. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen many researchers switch into safety research and produce impactful work, and we think there\u2019s still a lot of ground to cover.\n\nApplications will be open until April 15, 2025. The first step is a 300-word expression of interest; we\u2019ll aim to respond within two weeks to invite strong applicants to write a full proposal. Applications will be evaluated on a rolling basis: the earlier you apply, the earlier we\u2019ll get back to you."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743372927.954, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
