Otherwise, install proper CUDA drivers and libraries.\n\n- **TensorFlow CPU Optimization Warning:**\n  - Suggests you can improve TensorFlow performance by compiling from source with optimizations.\n  - **Impact:** Performance only, not functionality.\n  - **Action:** Ignore for now. You can optimize TensorFlow later if you need higher performance.\n\n- **PyWavelets boundary effects warning:**\n  - Indicates your `pywt` (wavelet) parameters are a bit aggressive. \n  - **Impact:** Minor\u2014potential boundary artifacts in visualizations.\n  - **Action:** Reduce wavelet level from 5 to something lower (e.g., 3 or 4) if desired, but this is optional.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Recommended Immediate Action:\n\n- **No action required.** Your Streamlit app is functioning normally.\n- Add a brief note in your documentation that these messages are expected and safe to ignore if CUDA acceleration isn't required.\n\n**If you prefer to eliminate these messages** (optional):\n\n```bash\npip uninstall tensorflow\npip install tensorflow-cpu\n```\n\nThis switches to the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, eliminating CUDA warnings altogether.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Quick README Note (Optional):\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Streamlit Notices:**  \n> - CUDA-related messages during Streamlit app startup are safe to ignore if GPU acceleration isn't required.  \n> - To suppress, use CPU-only TensorFlow (`pip install tensorflow-cpu`).\n\nYou're safe to move forward without further intervention!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743550165.262836, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
