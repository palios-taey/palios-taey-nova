With the amount of disruption that is going to happen, have you thought about entrepreneurship. There are a lot of traditional companies that will not be ready for AI. A lot of them are currently owned by people at retirement age with no exit strategy. Understanding businesses that have been misunderstood for decades is an opportunity when data and analytics are applied. Keep your head up and your eyes open. New markets are being created.\r\n\r\nLike\r\n\r\nReply\r\nView Paul Jackson\u2019s profile\r\nPaul Jackson\r\n \u2022 1st\r\nCEO/Founder: Jackson Brothers Tickets\r\n14m\r\n\r\nVery smart and creative.
