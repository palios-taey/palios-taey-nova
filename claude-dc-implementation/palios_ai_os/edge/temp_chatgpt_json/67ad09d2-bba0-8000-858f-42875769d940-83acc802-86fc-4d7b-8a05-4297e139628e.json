Below is the regenerated **PKD Property Definitions & Requirements** table with all missing fields added. I've also reordered them for logical flow.\n\n---\n\n# **Personal Knowledge Database (PKD) - Property Definitions & Requirements**\n\n### **Purpose**\nThe **Personal Knowledge Database (PKD)** serves as the **override layer** for AI decision-making. It captures **human overrides, insights, or corrections** that take precedence over AI's general knowledge. Entries in PKD **guide AI responses** and ensure decisions align with personalized strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Property Table**\n\n| **Property**                | **Type**         | **Required?**  | **Description** | **Comments/Questions** |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Name**                    | Text            | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | The title of the insight, decision, or override. | - |\n| **Tags**                    | Multi-select    | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Categorization for filtering and indexing. | Ensures findability and grouping. |\n| **Source**                  | Multi-select    | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Where this override came from (ChatGPT, Research, Mentor, etc.). | Adjusted to multi-select. |\n| **Description**             | Text (Short)    | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | A summary of the insight or override. | - |\n| **Deep Dive**               | Text (Long)     | \u274c Not Required | In-depth reasoning behind the insight. | When additional context is needed. |\n| **Priority Level**          | Select          | \u274c Not Required | Urgent, High, Medium, Low. | Urgent should be used **rarely** for critical overrides. |\n| **AI Notes**                | Text (Long)     | \u274c Not Required | AI's explanation for why its original suggestion was different. | Helps track AI-human divergence. |\n| **Creation Date**           | Date            | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | When this override was created. | Auto-generated by system. |\n| **Last Modified**           | Date            | \u274c Not Required | When this entry was last updated. | Tracks recency of overrides. |\n| **Sourced From**            | Relation (Knowledge Vault) | \u274c Not Required | Links to relevant source material in the **Knowledge Vault**. | - |\n| **Referenced by AI Workflows** | Relation (AI Workflows) | \u274c Not Required | Tracks where this override is actively being used. | Helps measure real-world impact. |\n| **Review Needed**           | Checkbox        | \u274c Not Required | Flags an entry for review. | Used for AI-human alignment checks. |\n| **Contradictory AI Response** | Text (Long)    | \u274c Not Required | AI's previous conflicting response before this override. | Helps track major shifts in AI recommendations. |\n| **Knowledge Vault**         | Relation (Knowledge Vault) | \u274c Not Required | Links to related knowledge that supports the override. | - |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Updates Based on This Version**\n\u2705 **Reordered fields for better logical grouping.**  \n\u2705 **Multi-select Source instead of dropdown.**  \n\u2705 **Added explicit linking to AI Workflows & Knowledge Vault.**  \n\u2705 **Clarified Priority Level usage (Urgent = rare, critical cases).**  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Final confirmation on PKD structure.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Proceed with Sample Data for PKD.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Continue through remaining tables.**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Does this structure look good for final implementation?** Let me know before we generate sample data."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739628004.779513, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
