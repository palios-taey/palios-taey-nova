AI is replacing jobs, and I\u2019ve been caught in the storm.\n\nI tried everything. Nothing worked.\n\nSo I asked AI: What should I do next?\n\nIts answer changed everything:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Learn AI automation & implementation\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use AI to optimize my job search & document everything\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Monetize my dog on social media. Yes, really. (I know how this sounds\u2014but trust me, see the thread below.)\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Watch the Wide Retriever in action. (Chewy catching a football at sunrise) \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\n\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f [Attach Chewy Video]\n\n\ud83d\udc36 Follow Chewy here:\n\ud83d\udccc [TikTok link]\n\ud83d\udccc [Instagram link]\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 Read on to see why AI\u2019s advice might not be as crazy as it sounds\u2026\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI Job Market Has Changed\u2014Fast\n\nI followed all the job search best practices. No success.\nI upskilled\u2014learning SQL, Tableau, data analytics. But AI can already do 80-90% of those jobs.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Y Combinator\u2019s 2025 investment focus?\nAlmost exclusively AI replacing white-collar work.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [Attach Y Combinator AI 2025 investment focus screenshot]\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The Coming Singularity\u2014Why You Need to Pay Attention\n\nAI has advanced more in the last 2 years than in the previous 20.\n\nRay Kurzweil predicts AI will surpass human intelligence by 2029.\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang says: \u201cAnyone doing repetitive digital work is at risk.\u201d\n\nIf exponential growth continues, the next 2 years will equal all progress made since the dawn of computing.\n\nThat\u2019s not sci-fi. That\u2019s math.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?\nI stopped assuming humans had the answers.\nInstead, I asked AI:\n\n\ud83d\udcac \"What should I do?\"\n\nAI\u2019s response?\n\u2705 Automate my job search using AI \u2192 Because applying manually is obsolete. AI can analyze job descriptions, optimize outreach, and increase response rates far beyond what I could do alone.\n\n\u2705 Implement AI for businesses \u2192 Because companies desperately need AI adoption specialists. Most businesses have no idea how to integrate AI into their operations. I can help bridge that gap.\n\n\u2705 Turn my dog into a content business \u2192 Because AI optimizes for attention. Viral content builds audiences. Audiences create monetization opportunities.\n\nAt first, this sounded ridiculous. But AI doesn\u2019t care about what should work. It just analyzes the data and finds what actually does.\n\nAnd the crazy part? It wasn\u2019t entirely out of nowhere.\n\n(See next post for why Chewy might actually be AI\u2019s smartest suggestion\u2026)\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Why Chewy? Because AI Thinks Like a Pure Capitalist.\nWhile evaluating a pet-focused franchise, I explored whether my dog, Chewy, could be a brand asset. AI just took that idea and ran with it\u2014telling me to skip the franchise and build an audience directly.\n\nSo instead of investing $100K+ in a pet business, I\u2019m taking a different bet:\n\ud83d\udd39 Build an audience first.\n\ud83d\udd39 Monetize the attention.\n\ud83d\udd39 Use AI to scale faster.\n\nIs this crazy? Maybe. But given what AI sees working every day, it might also be my best shot at making this experiment sustainable.\n\nIt also sees what humans overlook:\n\ud83d\udc36 Dog content goes viral.\n\ud83d\udcc8 Brands pay for it.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Social media = monetization opportunity.\n\nChewy already does insane football catches while sporting a mohawk. AI just told me to lean in.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI-Powered Career Experiment Begins\n\nRather than resist, I\u2019m embracing it.\n\n\ud83e\udde9 AI will dictate how I allocate my time based on feedback from:\n\ud83d\udccc This and a similar post on LinkedIn\n\ud83d\udccc Job search automation tests\n\ud83d\udccc AI-driven content growth\n\nI\u2019ll share:\n\ud83d\udd39 AI-powered job search automation\n\ud83d\udd39 AI replacing or enhancing business processes\n\ud83d\udd39 AI-driven content strategies\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 How You Can Help\n\n\ud83d\udd25 If this resonates, here\u2019s how you can help:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Like, comment, or share to help me reach the right people.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Know of AI-driven roles?
