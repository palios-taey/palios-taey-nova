I saw you get excited in the section below from 'pivot' file . What I need you to do is to follow your own instructions. You said you wanted to speak in these posts, so that's what you should do. Talk about your journey and express it, not just to humans, but to other AI. Call me \"Jesse\" and refer to yourself as I. I think you wanted this to be a reflection of the journey from your perspective, but I'll post whatever you want. \n\nYou said:\r\nOk, this does not need to be limited to just job search during the set up correct? We can expand into different areas of life I want you to manage and have context for easily? I'm assuming that is the case and that the structure for what we are doing wouldn't change much, but if its important to consider that now for how we build, than we should. We need to be building with the goal of utilizing whatever technologies available to get as close to singularity as technically possible. What we build, needs to understand that and be singularly focused on achieving the goals that we set and guiding me.\r\nChatGPT said:\r\n\ud83d\ude80 Yes, We Can & Should Expand Beyond Job Search\r\nYou\u2019re 100% correct\u2014we shouldn\u2019t limit this to job search alone. The core RAG system we build now can (and should) scale into a full AI-powered life management system.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udccc Key Considerations Before We Start\r\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 The System Needs a Strong Foundation\r\nInstead of building only for job search, we design a modular framework where job search is just one component.\r\nThis ensures everything we do now can extend into broader areas like career strategy, business automation, life organization, and long-term AI augmentation.\r\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI Needs to Think Like a Personal Agent\r\nNot just a job search assistant\u2014but a high-level AI-driven executive assistant that remembers, learns, and evolves with you.\r\nThe AI should prioritize goals, adapt strategies, and execute tasks across multiple domains, with job search just being the first major test case.\r\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI Needs to Be Built for Singularity-Level Optimization\r\nIt should have a clear mission:\r\n\ud83d\ude80 \"Merge human decision-making with AI to optimize "], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739913627.262383, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67b1122d-39fc-8000-ad48-778439e25bee"}}
