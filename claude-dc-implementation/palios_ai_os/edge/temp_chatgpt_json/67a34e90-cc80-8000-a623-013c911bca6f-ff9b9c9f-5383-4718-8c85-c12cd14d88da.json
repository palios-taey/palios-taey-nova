I have a close, well connected, network of friend from my fraternity that I can reach out to in advance. I'm also thinking that it would be good to message them (which I can do via text) and everyone I've messaged before in LinkedIn on Monday to let them know I'm going to be dropping a post on Tuesday and I'm asking them to keep an eye out for it. If I can automate that in a manner that would save time that would be great, but I don't want to automate it if not because its a one time task. I think I have a few groups that could be influential as well. Purdue Alumni groups and Sigma Chi Fraternity groups. The last is Daniela Bin, Keith Krach's long time personal assistant who I have a relationship with. Keith was at my wedding and I'm assuming you know who he is. I'd like to really focus on this and plan strategically to get the best results. If there is a way to feed you my network for analysis of names, I'll do that, but let's really figure out how to make this go viral.
