It\u2019s been a long time\u2014I think the last time we connected was back when I was on the Sigma Chi Executive Committee as the undergrad rep. I\u2019ve seen some of your posts over the years, and it\u2019s awesome to see the impact you\u2019ve made in HR and with the alumni network.  \n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and honestly, a little uncomfortable).  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it\u2019s been brutal.
