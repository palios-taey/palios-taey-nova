If you have a rough estimate of relevant retalers they work with, that would be helpful to include as well. Regarding the PoV, the idea would be to give them a pov which would lead to a complimentary solution pending introductions and/or closed deal(s). The value would be that Tweezerman could communicate improved metrics first hand to their retailer partners. If the retailer partners engaged, Tweezerman would see a lift on their retailer sites as well and the retailer would see the benefit across their entire catalog. \r\nCold outreach \u2013 I\u2019d like to expand upon leveraging my experience from OJ in developing scalable and successful cold outreach initiatives. In all cold outreach, the key is to be specific to the target, preferably with an eye-popping insight to catch their attention. In Lily\u2019s case, this could be getting data on SKUs they currently manage that have seen a significant lift and then finding other retailers in their target verticals that have those skus as top sellers and crafting the email to include those SKUs and the lift our partners have seen on them from utilizing our solution. I believe this wouldn\u2019t be very time consuming, but could potentially lead to higher engagement rates. The first step would be to learn from existing AEs what works and what doesn\u2019t to develop a baseline, iterate, test and share results/learnings with the team. \r\nPartnerships \u2013 The prior list you provided, which must be in another chat was with companies like VTEX, Radial, Rithum, Marketplacer, Fabric and others that service retailers with large catalogs. No mega corporations like Amazon, Oracle or SAP should be included. Mayb elist out like 5-10.\r\nThought leadership \u2013 this should be more focused on my experience in managing large catalogs across multiple categories and operating a large ecommerce network as a retailer. Though the content might not align directly with Lily AI\u2019s solution, my depth of knowledge is valuable to the same departments Lily targets at retailers, in addition to posting Lily\u2019s marketing content with additional insights from my experience in dealing with the pain point that Lily solves. \r\nMarketing initative \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t put rick in the title, but can just reference him in the body as an example of an influencer that I have a good relationship with and have worked with before at CommerceHub. His insights were spot on there and is very respected in the industry. \r"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727987255.835783, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
