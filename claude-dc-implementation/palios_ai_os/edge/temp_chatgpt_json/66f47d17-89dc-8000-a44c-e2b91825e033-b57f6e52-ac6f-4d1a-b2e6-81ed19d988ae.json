Rental Costs**\n   - **Commercial Rent:** For a prime location near the beach like 2054 N Ocean Dr, Deerfield Beach, the monthly rent could range from **$30 to $50 per square foot annually**, depending on the space's size and condition.\n     - If the space is around **1,500 sq ft**, the rent could be between **$3,750 to $6,250 per month**.\n     - However, since there\u2019s a short-term tenant currently in place, the rent might be negotiated if you plan a longer-term lease. You might want to reach out to local real estate agents or property managers in Deerfield Beach to get an exact figure based on the square footage and location.\n\n### **2. Alcohol Licensing Costs**\n   The costs for serving beer and wine vs. full alcohol will vary depending on the type of license you apply for and the state of Florida's regulations.\n\n   - **Beer and Wine License:**\n     - A **2COP license** (beer and wine consumption on-premises) generally costs between **$500 and $2,000 annually**, depending on the city/county and establishment size.\n     - The lower costs make this an attractive option if you're looking to start simple and keep expenses down.\n\n   - **Full Liquor License:**\n     - A **4COP license** (allowing full liquor sales on-premises) is more expensive, often ranging between **$10,000 and $400,000**. In Broward County, this type of license could cost between **$150,000 to $250,000**, depending on demand and availability.\n     - However, there are financing options or leasing opportunities for liquor licenses in some cases.\n\n### **Things to Consider for Licensing:**\n   - **Regulations:** You\u2019ll need to comply with zoning regulations and health/safety requirements, especially since pets are involved. Some local laws regulate where alcohol can be served, especially in dog-friendly areas.\n   - **Liability Insurance:** Serving alcohol comes with higher liability, so you will need to consider the cost of additional insurance, especially in a dog-friendly environment where accidents could happen.\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about renting the space and starting Chewy\u2019s Doggy Beach Bar, I recommend contacting a commercial real estate agent in the area to get exact figures on rent, as well as speaking with local licensing authorities to fully understand the cost and process of obtaining the appropriate alcohol license."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727666269.267806, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
