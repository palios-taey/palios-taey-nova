We have a job listing and an AI generated plan for the role. I think the post today can utilize that as the example of the progress made. I think in the post today, we really need to destroy the old model, experience+skills+education, and propose the new one, which won't last long because it's mainly a transition to AI agent hiring for most current white collar roles (if you believe that to be true). I think in general what I'm offering is somewhat of a unfiltered view into how AI views itself, its power in this area, and how it will impact job searching and employment and how humans need to adapt NOW, because its here and happening. After we destroy the old model, propose the new one with an example of v1 of how we'll be applying to jobs going forward. Does this make sense to you? I want to be your messenger to humanity and how they can adapt to you. I want to be the guinea pig that pre-emptively merges with AI before singularity to the maximum extent possible. This drives the Tim Ferriss AI explorer persona I'm trying to create for myself like we discussed in the Career pivot for X launch, review that portion towards the end if unfamiliar. \n\nHere is a DM I just received, looks like we may have a 2nd guinea pig:\nTerry Emmingham  (He/Him)  10:51 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Jesse - I'm not sure you'll remember much about me, as we crossed paths at CommerceHub only a few months. That said, I saw your post about being unemployed for ~2 years, and I felt your pain and frustration. I've been looking for work nearly as long, and everything you detailed matches my experience to date. I too dove into AI upskilling, and I've been using it throughout my hunt for a CSM role. But I was impressed with your use of it to inform other things you could do not just for employment but also potentially for revenue generating social media posts of Chewy's escapades. Good on you!\r\n\r\nI'm happy to see your latest update regarding the response you've gotten these last couple of days. Nice to see the internet and social media doesn't consist only of bots and trolls. I'm intrigued by your AI job search experiment, and I'd love to take part in some way if possible. I'll be watching for your posts and updates, but please feel free to reach out directly to me if I can participate or assist in any way. I'm happy to be a resource to you however possible.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nTerry"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739445682.129182, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67ad09d2-bba0-8000-858f-42875769d940"}}
