I have been seeking employment for nearly 2 years and have been unable to find anything. I am out of money and desperate for work so am seeking roles that are around 100K when I used to make 300K. My wife and I are both Ubering a lot, but it is not nearly enough to cover expenses, let alone enjoy life. I'm wondering what I should do. I have about 270K in retirement account and 200-300K in equity in my condo, 505 NE 20th Ave, 203, 33441. To leverage that, I could rent it out or sell if needed and live somewhere lower cost. What do you think I should do with my life? Taking a job at 100K is not ideal, but might be fine to at least get some stable income and Uber on the side. What should I do and what questions do you have to help me figure it out?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1727712574.69179, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
