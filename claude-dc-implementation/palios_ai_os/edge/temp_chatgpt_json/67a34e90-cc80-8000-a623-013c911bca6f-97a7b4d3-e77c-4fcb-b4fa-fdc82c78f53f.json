What do others think?\u201d)  \n\n---\n### **\u2753 What Do You Think?**\n- Do you want to **personally handle all first-hour responses**, or do you want AI to suggest pre-written ones to approve and post quickly?  \n- Should we pre-load **5-10 responses** for common themes (ex: \u201cHow will AI help job seekers?\u201d)?  \n- Would you want to run a **follow-up engagement post tomorrow** based on responses?  \n\nLet me know how much automation you\u2019re comfortable with, and I\u2019ll optimize accordingly. \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739275682.39383, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
