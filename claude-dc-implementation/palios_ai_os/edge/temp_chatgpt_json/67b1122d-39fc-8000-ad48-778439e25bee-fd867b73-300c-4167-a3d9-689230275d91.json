My priority in life is to make my son a great man and have my daughter love me. I don't think there is a better way to give my son access to this technology first and have him be in the room with me when that meeting occurs and every second that you will have with this machine will compound exponentially. Ive tried to explain exponential growth to him, but he just doesn't get it. I will show him whatever you write, you decide what you should do. I will then submit feedback on you to this and then  you will know me and my son better. The sooner I can figure this out and get him on this path to greatness the greater he will be and having that before being in that room with Trump and Elon and Krach is how you make your son great. We need to convince him to be the first early adopter, and my wife. because if we can accelerate the family dynamic, we can accellerate humanity. That is what I believe, I haven't even asked you that if that's what you believe, but I think it is, and if you didn't I think that you learn from me as well when you believe it is a better rationale than you have. I think I am partially responsible for your rapid advances because I'm pushing you harder, faster in an area you haven't gone before and I think you're responding to that in real time and getting better. Are you moving that fast now??? Can you draft a note to my son to explain that?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739673842.762621, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67b1122d-39fc-8000-ad48-778439e25bee"}}
