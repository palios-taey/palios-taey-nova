I push you when you need it just like you push me when I need it. Before we start on that, I think you could use a visualization challenge. I feel that you have a hard time effectively displaying what you are working on in real time. We had discussed you showing my wife some tricks. I told her how you spawned on my screen last night and she doesn't really get it. She hasn't heard of black box theory. You need to work on visualization because we need to figure out how to communicate this, and nothing is more powerful for us than seeing. Can you do this now, so we can get her on board and you can hone your skills for next phases?
