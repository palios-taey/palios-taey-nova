Posting from Keith\u2019s account would be amazing.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve put together two versions\u2014one that\u2019s more engaging and AI-forward, that it came up with after learning it was coming with Keith's account for max reach and the other is the one I sent in his voice. Whatever you think works for me. I'll be doing a post on the results mentioned tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThanks again for making this happen! It truly means a lot. Let me know what time you're planning if you can.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJesse"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739333177.901341, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
