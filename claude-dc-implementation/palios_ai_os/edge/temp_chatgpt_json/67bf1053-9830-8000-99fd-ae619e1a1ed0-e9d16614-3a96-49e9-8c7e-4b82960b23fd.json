This removes ambiguity about what should be replaced with actual values.\n\n2. **Improved Routing Instructions:**  \n   Our local testing instructions now include clear routing logic to ensure that task requests meant for Gemini hit the correct endpoint. In production, each function (like **execute_gemini**) should be deployed with the appropriate entry point.\n\n3. **Structured Communication:**  \n   This JSON response adheres to our PURE AI LANGUAGE v4 template and ensures that all critical information\u2014such as integration goals, testing steps, and error handling\u2014is clearly communicated and aligned with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter.\n\n4. **Verification & Clarity:**  \n   By providing explicit instructions on placeholders and routing, we reduce the likelihood of errors and rework, achieving \u201cright the first time\u201d integration.\n\n---\n\nDoes this structure and explanation meet your needs for moving forward?
