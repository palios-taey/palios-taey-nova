They also asked if the change will be permanent and how it behaves in the cloud. In cloud environments like Cloud Functions, the `__main__` block isn't used, as the framework designates entry points. So, the custom routing is for local testing only. I'll update the `main.py` with custom handling for both GET /health and POST /execute_gemini endpoints."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740589462.147829, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
