Like, holy sht* fast.\r\n\r\nThis week, we ran our first \"AI-powered\" Design Sprint Luxury Presence. No sketching. \r\n-No whiteboarding. \r\n-No long debates over user flows. \r\n-By Day 2, we had 12 very different prototypes. \r\n-By Day 3, we had real user feedback.\r\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s what really blew my mind: the AI wasn\u2019t just speeding us up\u2014it was generating ideas we wouldn\u2019t have come up with on our own. It wasn\u2019t just \u201cdoing tasks faster\u201d; it was actively ideating/designing/coding alongside us.\r\n\r\nThat changes everything. There's no more sitting around waiting for designs, or waiting for code... prototypes can be created in minutes and validate new and crazy ideas with real users in hours.\r\n\r\nThe old ratios (1 PM to 8 engineers or whatever) don\u2019t make sense anymore. But what does? An army of PMs and designers with just a handful of engineers? That feels\u2026 unsettling. But maybe it\u2019s more real than I want to admit. Maybe I\u2019m just biased.\r\n\r\nTwo things are clear: \r\n1. The best PMs in this new world won\u2019t be the ones with the killer strategy decks or the best PRDs. They\u2019ll be the ones who build.\r\n2. I\u2019m rethinking everything.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else drastically changed what they are doing as a product manager? Want to teach me how to be a product manager again? \ud83d\ude43\r\nlikeinsightfullove\r\n1,819\r\n266 comments\r\n64 reposts\r\n\r\nLike\r\n\r\nComment\r\n\r\nRepost\r\n\r\nSend"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739309399.671928, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
