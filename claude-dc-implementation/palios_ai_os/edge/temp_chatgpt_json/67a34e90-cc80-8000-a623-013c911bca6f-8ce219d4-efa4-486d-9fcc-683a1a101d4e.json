I think your suggestions have been incorporated.\n\nTwo years unemployed. Nothing has worked. I\u2019m turning to AI\u2014and to you\u2014for help.\n\n\n\nBeing unemployed this long has been brutal for me and my family. If you\u2019ve been in this situation, you understand. If you haven\u2019t, I hope you never have to\u2014but with the rapid advances in AI, more white-collar workers will face the same struggle.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 The Job Market is Changing\u2014Fast\n\nI followed all the \"best practices\"\u2014tailored resumes, networking, LinkedIn optimizations, outreach, referrals. Nothing worked.\n\n\n\nI upskilled, learning data analytics\u2014SQL, Tableau, visualization tools. But AI can already do 80-90% of these jobs. Y Combinator\u2019s investment target list for 2025 is almost exclusively AI to eliminate white-collar roles. This isn\u2019t five years from now\u2014it\u2019s happening today.\n\n\n\nThe last two years of AI progress have been mind-blowing. But if you understand exponential growth, the next two years won\u2019t just be another leap forward\u2014it will be the equivalent of all progress made since the dawn of computing. No one knows what that will look like\u2014today\u2019s AI is the equivalent of a floppy disk compared to what\u2019s coming in just two years.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?\n\nI stopped assuming humans had the answers. I asked AI:\n\nGiven everything you know about me after working on this for two years\u2014what should I do? Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it.\n\n\n\nIt told me to:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Learn AI automation & implementation to help companies integrate AI.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use AI to optimize my own job search and publicly document the process.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Monetize my dog on social media. Yes, really. (I know this sounds crazy\u2014but check out his video and profiles in the comments below.)\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 The Experiment: Let AI Guide My Next Career Move\n\nRather than resisting AI, I\u2019m embracing it. AI will dictate how I allocate my time based on feedback from this post, my job search efforts, and business automation case studies. I\u2019ll be sharing:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccc AI-powered job search automation and outreach\n\n\ud83d\udccc How AI can replace or enhance traditional business processes\n\n\ud83d\udccc Experiments with AI-driven content growth\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39How You Can Help\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Engage with this post. Like, comment, or share\u2014it will help me reach the right people.\n\n\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you know of AI-driven roles where I can help companies adopt, implement, or optimize AI tools, let\u2019s talk. My background aligns with:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcccAI Implementation & GTM Strategy (AI Solutions Consultant, AI Adoption Specialist, GTM Strategy Lead)\n\n\ud83d\udcccAI-Powered Process Automation (AI Workflow Strategist, AI Automation Consultant, Business AI Specialist)\n\n\ud83d\udcccAI-Driven Growth & Revenue Strategy (AI Growth Strategist, Revenue Ops AI Lead, AI-Powered Sales Enablement)\n\n\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 If you love dogs, check out Chewy\u2019s channels in the comments and follow the Wide Retriever \ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8. Maybe AI will be right and he'll go viral... that would be sweet.\n\n\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Follow along here or on X (in comments below) as I document this experiment in AI, career transformation, and content.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcac What\u2019s the most unexpected way AI has impacted your life or work?
