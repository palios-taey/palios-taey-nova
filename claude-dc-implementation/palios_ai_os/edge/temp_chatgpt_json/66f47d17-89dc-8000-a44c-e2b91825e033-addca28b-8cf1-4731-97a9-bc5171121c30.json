To achieve this, I restructured the service into **tiered engagement models**, developed new **sales collateral and marketing materials**, and redesigned the outreach processes to improve lead qualification.\n\nA critical part of this transformation was conducting in-depth **training sessions** for both the sales and account management teams. I trained them on the new **tiered offering**, how to position the product to different client segments, and how to effectively utilize new **outreach templates** and processes. This enablement program was essential for ensuring the teams could adapt quickly to the new structure and continue driving revenue growth.\n\nWould you like to add any specific outcomes or feedback from this experience?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1728071580.356621, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
