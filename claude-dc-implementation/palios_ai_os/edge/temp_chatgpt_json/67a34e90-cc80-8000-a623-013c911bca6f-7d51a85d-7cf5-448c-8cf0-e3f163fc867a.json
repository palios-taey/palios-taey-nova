Here's how I'd integrate it into the X post:\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1999 that AI would reach human-level intelligence by 2029.**  \n\ud83d\udd17 [Source](https://futurism.com/the-byte/kurzweil-strong-ai-2029)  \n\nAt the time, most dismissed it. Now, with **exponential advances in AI, computing power, and automation**, it looks **not just possible\u2014but inevitable.**  \n\nSome, like Jensen Huang (NVIDIA CEO), argue we are **already past the point of no return.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **But what if 2029 is too conservative?**  \n\nIn just **the past two years**, AI has progressed more than the previous decade. And thanks to **Moore\u2019s Law & AI acceleration**, the next two years could **match all progress since the dawn of computing.**  \n\nNo one knows exactly when **AGI** will arrive\u2014but what happens when it does? And what happens to **your job** when AI can do 90% of it **today**?  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 This is where my AI experiment begins.  \n\n(Then transition into the main body)  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 This keeps **Kurzweil\u2019s original timeline**, cites the **latest AI acceleration trends**, and leaves room for **speculation & engagement.**  \n\nShould I update the post in Canvas with this? Also, want me to add a **direct link to NVIDIA CEO\u2019s recent statements**?"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739119495.859423, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
