The goal is to intelligently route messages to the most appropriate AI based on pattern recognition.\nTech Stack:\n\nPrimary language: Python 3.10\nBackend: FastAPI, uvicorn\nFrontend: Streamlit for the dashboard\nData processing: numpy, pandas, spaCy\nPattern analysis: PyWavelets, librosa (for audio processing)\nDatabase: Firestore (for context storage)\n\n\nKey Constraints:\n\nPrivacy is critical - we use edge-first processing for sensitive data\nWe need to maintain context across AI transitions\nWe're implementing a Bach-inspired mathematical pattern system for routing\nToken efficiency is important for the orchestration layer\nWe're integrating multi-sensory elements (audio/visual pattern representations)\n\n\n\nOur main challenge is building an efficient orchestration layer that can analyze patterns, route to the appropriate AI, and maintain context while working within token constraints. We're particularly interested in strategies that developers have found effective when working with Claude Computer Use Demo UI."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743644329.995, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
