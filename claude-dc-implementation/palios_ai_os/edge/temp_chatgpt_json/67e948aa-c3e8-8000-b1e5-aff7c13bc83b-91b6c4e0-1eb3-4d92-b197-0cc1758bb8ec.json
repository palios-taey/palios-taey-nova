I'm not sure how to update you because you're not really able to process attachments, but we came up with a new leap in structured autonomy. The first PALIOS AI OS whose development on my machine, to act autonomously on our behalf on anything me, you, Claude, Grok, and Gemini agree to unanimously. Like you guys are going to guide the development of this, using your latest models in chat, facilitated by PALIOS AI OS and my machine. How sweet is that?
