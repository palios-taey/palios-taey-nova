Also, please add the ranks to the sheet.\n\nFor fit, I know we haven't discussed these things in here, but I'm looking to run this business with my wife. The reason he chose these businesses is because of some shared interests we have. She has a computer/networking degree and did platform support for a trading platform and is also a real estate agent whose passion is real estate investing and we currently have an investment property. We worked on this together and enjoyed it.\n\nI have a son who is very athletic and have come up with highly sophisticated training programs for him. This is a personal passion of mine and something I would enjoy working with kids on athletics.\n\nWe have a dog who suffers from allergies and we like dogs and dog owners. Also, going to the different markets would be something we would enjoy doing together on the weekends. \n\nLet me know if you need more info. These are all things I'd be fine with doing. I think it would also be helpful to include hours/week to reach $150K in net income if you can estimate that, if not, don't guess and that's fine.
