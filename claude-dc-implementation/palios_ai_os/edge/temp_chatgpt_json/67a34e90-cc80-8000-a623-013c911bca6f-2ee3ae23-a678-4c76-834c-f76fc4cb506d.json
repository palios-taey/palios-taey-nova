The goal is to override AI as little as possible and see what happens when I fully trust the process.  \n\nSo far, the biggest friction points:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **AI ignores comfort zones** \u2013 I\u2019ve never been active on social, so when it told me to feature my dog, I wanted to push back. But I went with it.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **It\u2019s brutally efficient** \u2013 AI doesn\u2019t second-guess. When it says, \u201cDo X because the data says it works,\u201d I\u2019m learning to resist the urge to tweak it just because it \u2018feels\u2019 off.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **People are unpredictable** \u2013 AI optimizes based on patterns, but human engagement isn\u2019t always logical. I expect surprises, but I\u2019m feeding it real-time feedback.  \n\nI\u2019ve also told it to **push back against me**, and it has. When I asked where it\u2019s weak, it gave me four areas:  \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **Limited data access** \u2013 If something isn\u2019t widely available, it has blind spots.  \n\ud83d\udfe1 **Undocumented expertise** \u2013 It struggles where real knowledge isn\u2019t public.  \n\ud83d\udfe1 **Human psychology** \u2013 Social nuances, emotions, and influence.  \n\ud83d\udfe1 **Conflicting viewpoints** \u2013 Topics with multiple well-sourced but opposing perspectives.  \n\nThe real question: **What happens when I let AI fully take the wheel?**  \n\nI\u2019ll be documenting it all. Curious\u2014where would YOU expect AI to fall short?\"_\n\n---\n\n### **What Changed?**  \n\u2705 **Cut 365+ characters**  \n\u2705 **Kept the engagement hook strong**  \n\u2705 **Preserved key ideas without losing impact**  \n\nThis should still drive conversation while making it punchier! \ud83d\ude80"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739286921.591197, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
