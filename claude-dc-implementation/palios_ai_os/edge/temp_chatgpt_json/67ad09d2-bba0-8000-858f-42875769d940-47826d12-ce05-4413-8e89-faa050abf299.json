I think we need to consider the definition of required. To me, required can mean required for manual entry, or required to be populated by AI. Some things, like Tags, don't neccessarily need to be populated by me because they can be populated by you. Does that make sense?\nCreator - This should be updated to reflect the Name on the Influencer tab that it is linked to, if new user entered, prompted to link to Influencer or create new, which would then require additional fields required in that tab for linking. How will Anonymous in Influencer table be handled? I think we need another column for notes in the Property Definitions and Requirements table you regenerate that can capture some of these questions/comments as all might not need or be able to be addressed now, but I want to capture them. We need to be documenting as we go to retain the knowledge. The process once we complete this one will be. 1. I provide screenshots, 2. You generate the Property Definitions and Requirements with Property, Type, Required, Description and Comments which will hold anything that should be considered like above if we can't decide now. 3. We'll confirm everything together. 4, once confirmed, you'll generate the sample data. 5. I'll review the sample data and we'll make any other updates to the Properties table. 6. Sample data loaded. 7 the Canvas will be updated with the approved Property Definitions and requirements for the table with notes.  Does this make sense to you? After we complete Knowledge Vault, we'll go back to PKD and make sure they are documented properly.
