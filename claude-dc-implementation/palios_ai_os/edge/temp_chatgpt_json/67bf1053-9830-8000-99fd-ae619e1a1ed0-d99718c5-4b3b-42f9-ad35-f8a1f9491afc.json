This means another process (or a previous instance of your server) is still bound to that port. To resolve this, you have two options:\n\n1. **Terminate the Process on Port 8080:**  \n   - On Windows, open a Command Prompt and run:\n     ```cmd\n     netstat -ano | findstr :8080\n     ```\n   - Identify the process ID (PID) using that port, then kill it with:\n     ```cmd\n     taskkill /PID <PID> /F\n     ```\n   Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID.\n\n2. **Change the Port Number:**  \n   - Edit **main.py** and change the `PORT` variable from 8080 to an unused port (e.g., 8081):\n     ```python\n     if __name__ == '__main__':\n         PORT = 8081  # Changed port\n         class HealthCheckHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n             ...\n     ```\n   - Save the file and run:\n     ```cmd\n     python main.py\n     ```\n\nEither option should resolve the socket address error. Let me know once you've made the change or terminated the process, and then we can proceed with testing the Gemini integration endpoint."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740589005.666215, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
