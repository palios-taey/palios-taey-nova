So, my guess is the target audience might be wrong. We're using \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com,\" but maybe it should be \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/\" with a trailing slash.\n\nThe documentation seems to suggest \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com\" is correct, but I want to double-check. I\u2019m also considering using default credentials to get an access token using `google.auth.default()`. Or maybe I\u2019ll try the service account credentials without specifying id_token. Let me be careful here!\n\n**Troubleshooting 401 error**\n\nThe 401 error might be related to missing or incorrect token authentication. Maybe using `google.auth.default()` to get credentials, then calling `credentials.refresh(...)` might give the correct token. But the previous error mentioned that the token wasn't provided\u2014could be that the service account's credentials can't generate a token for this specific endpoint.\n\nI should check if the service account has the right roles, possibly \"Generative Language API User.\" I'll advise checking the service account\u2019s roles, ensuring the correct target audience and considering whether to use an access token instead of an ID token approach."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740593926.136247, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
