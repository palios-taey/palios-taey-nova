The tweet is already a 6 part thread plus main post. Not just another post? I get the comments on linkedIn because that's where the visibility is, but just think can post new updates as new posts on x no? It's more to just have stuff on there to make it look active. I don't think I have time to focus on building x now, really need to start on the MVP for Monday after getting this post up and driving LinkedIn engagement.
