Or is that doable without more time? \n\n\ud83e\udd14 Do we prioritize \u201cAI finds & auto-applies\u201d first, or \u201cAI generates job application assets instantly\u201d first?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 I\u2019d suggest starting with \u201cAI generates assets instantly\u201d (since auto-applying is tricky for complex applications), then adding auto-submission next.\n\nI think we start at the beginning. AI finds the jobs and develops the assets, those are the first steps in the process before submitting. An argument could be made for pre-networking, but I think we can back up to that. I think there are a lot of ways we could enhance this, like if we see someone leaving a job at a target company on LinkedIn, that might mean that is an opportunity to send an automated message to the hiring manager asking if they're backfilling. Anyway, don't want to get ahead of myself, but that's how im thinking about this, you said automate everything and I think the instant job search and asset creation with tracking is where we start if it can be accomplished in 30 hours or whatever by Monday with bonus of actually submitting them then that would be great if not it can be a fast follow.
