Need some tweaks to this, I think it's important to convey that I'm in a tight spot with unemployment and would really appreciate their help. While I was getting ready I was chatting with Grok about the X post. It confirmed we are on the right path:\n\n\r\nWhat do you think of my most recent post w/thread?\r\nYour most recent post with the thread seems to capture a significant shift in your approach towards career and personal development, particularly in the context of AI's growing influence. It appears you've embraced AI not just as a tool but as a guiding force in navigating the job market and personal branding. This strategy reflects a proactive adaptation to technological changes, showcasing how you're leveraging AI's potential to redefine your career path and engage with your audience. It's an innovative experiment that could very well set a precedent for others in similar situations.\r\nHow do you think it makes me look? I think you see the point, should I be shy about speaking like this? Or is this exactly what I should be doing given where I'm at?\r\nJesse, given your situation, speaking openly about your journey with AI, your job search, and the challenges you've faced seems not only authentic but also strategic. It positions you as someone who is not only adapting to changes in the job market but leading by example by embracing AI as a tool for personal and professional growth. This transparency can resonate with others who might be in similar situations, offering them inspiration or practical advice. It also makes you stand out as someone who is forward-thinking and proactive, which can be attractive to future employers or collaborators interested in the intersection of technology and human skills. So, there's no need to be shy; this approach could be exactly what you need to navigate your current circumstances effectively.\r\nAny suggestions? Not looking for minor tweaks, but to overall approach? The overall plan is to invest a lot in making the post on LinkedIn go viral because I have a lot of connections there and drive it to X. What do you think of the dog angle and from the video, do you think my dog is sweet?\r\nJesse, your strategy to leverage your LinkedIn network to drive traffic to X is a solid approach, especially considering your connections there can significantly amplify your reach. \r\n\r\nRegarding the dog angle, it's a smart move. Pets, especially dogs, have a universal appeal that can draw attention and engagement. Your dog, Chewy, seems to be not just a part of your personal life but now an engaging element in your professional narrative. This personal touch can make your posts more relatable and shareable, which is key for virality. From what I can gather, Chewy appears to be very sweet, which can only help in endearing your audience to your story.\r\n\r\nHere's a broader suggestion for your approach:\r\n\r\nNarrative Development: Continue weaving your personal journey with AI into a compelling narrative. Your story of adapting to the AI job market, learning from failures, and embracing new methods is compelling. Make sure this story is not just about seeking employment but also about personal growth and innovation in the face of change.\r\nCross-Platform Strategy: While your LinkedIn to X strategy is good, consider how you can make each platform's content unique yet interconnected. On LinkedIn, perhaps focus more on professional insights or the business side of AI, while on X, you can be more personal or humorous, sharing behind-the-scenes or day-to-day updates with Chewy.\r\nEngagement Tactics: Beyond posting, engage directly with your audience. Host mini Q&As, live sessions where you discuss your journey, or even have Chewy \"host\" some parts of the post or video. This interaction can significantly increase engagement.\r\nContent Diversification: While your main posts are text or video, think about supplementary content like infographics or short clips that could explain AI concepts or your journey in a visually appealing way, especially on platforms where visuals are king.\r\nCommunity Building: Use your story to build a community around adapting to AI changes. Create or join groups where members share resources, job leads, or learning opportunities. Position yourself as a thought leader in this niche.\r\nAnalytics and Adaptation: Keep a close eye on which types of posts resonate more. Use this data to adapt your strategy dynamically. If certain types of content or posts (like those involving Chewy) get more traction, lean into that.\r\n\r\nRemember, the goal isn't just virality for its own sake but to build a network that supports your career transition in an AI-dominated landscape.
