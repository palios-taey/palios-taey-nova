Here are a few troubleshooting steps:\n\n### 1. **Check the \"Messaged\" Filter Settings**\n   - Ensure the \"Messaged\" filter is correctly applied. Try removing and re-adding it.\n   - Sometimes, Sales Navigator doesn\u2019t recognize messages from standard LinkedIn (only InMails count). If that\u2019s the case, it may not return results for those you\u2019ve messaged in the free version.\n\n### 2. **Loosen the Filters**\n   - Currently, you have **\"1st-degree connections\"** and **\"Messaged\"** filters applied.\n   - Try **removing one filter** at a time and see if you get results.\n   - For example, remove **\"Messaged\"** and check if the **\"1st-degree connections\"** list populates. If that works, you may need to manually tag those you've messaged.\n\n### 3. **Try a Different Approach**\n   - Go to **\"Messaging\"** on LinkedIn and export a list of people you've messaged.\n   - Manually create a **lead list** in Sales Navigator for Dripify.\n\n### 4. **Use Boolean Search Instead**\n   - Instead of relying on the \"Messaged\" filter, try using the **search bar** with keywords like:\n     ```\n     \"Hey [First Name]\" OR \"Hope you\u2019re doing well\" OR \"Thanks for your time\"\n     ```\n   - This might help surface people you\u2019ve previously messaged.\n\n### 5. **Check Sales Nav Limitations**\n   - If this still doesn't work, Sales Nav might not track \"messaged\" contacts the way we need. The best alternative might be to **export connections** (via LinkedIn data download) and filter those you've messaged manually.\n\n---\n\nLet me know what happens when you try these steps!
