Kind of like 'it's at worth least a chat right?' \nHello Andrew,\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I\u2019m reaching out because I noticed that Logicbroker is currently hiring for the Director, Commerce Revenue position, and I\u2019m very interested in the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I was offered this role but chose to pursue an opportunity at Mirakl... Peyman warned me against it, but we all learn from our choices! During my time there, I further honed my skills in enterprise sales, building scalable digital marketplaces, and driving consistent revenue growth in the eCommerce and retail sectors. Given Logicbroker\u2019s impressive client base and exciting growth plans, I believe this role is an excellent fit for my experience and expertise.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Logicbroker\u2019s continued success. Please let me know if you have time for a brief conversation next week.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to connecting.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJesse\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jesselarose/"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1728484839.173737, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "66f47d17-89dc-8000-a44c-e2b91825e033"}}
