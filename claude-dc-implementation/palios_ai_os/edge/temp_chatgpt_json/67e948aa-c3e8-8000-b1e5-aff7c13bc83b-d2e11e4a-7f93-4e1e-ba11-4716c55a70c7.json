PyYAML 5.4.1 has known compatibility issues when installed directly on newer Python versions.\n\nHere's what you should do to resolve this quickly:\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n**1. Update the `requirements.txt`:**  \nReplace the current PyYAML line with a newer stable version known to be compatible, such as:\n```bash\nPyYAML==6.0.1\n```\n\n**2. Re-run the setup script:**  \n```bash\n./scripts/setup.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### Updated and Validated `requirements.txt` Entry:\n```bash\nPyYAML==6.0.1\n```\n\n### Why This Change?  \n- PyYAML version 6.x is fully compatible with Python 3.11.\n- It provides pre-built wheels, preventing build errors like the one you're seeing.\n- It maintains backward compatibility with earlier versions.\n\n---\n\n### Other notes:  \n- **The other packages you previously removed** from the `requirements.txt` file (like `command-not-found`, `Brlapi`, etc.) **typically are installed at the system level**.  \n- **If those packages are needed**, they should be installed using your system's package manager (`apt`) rather than `pip`.\n\nIf those system-level packages are required, include them in your `setup.sh` script by adding:\n\n```bash\n# System dependencies installation\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y brltty cups command-not-found python3-commandnotfound\n```\n\nThis separates clearly system-level dependencies from Python-specific packages.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Update `PyYAML` to `6.0.1` in your `requirements.txt`.\n- Optionally, add any necessary system-level dependencies to the setup script.\n- Run your script again, and it should successfully proceed without wheel build errors.\n\nThis should fix your current issue and allow you to finish configuring Claude DC's environment smoothly."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1743613411.709933, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67e948aa-c3e8-8000-b1e5-aff7c13bc83b"}}
