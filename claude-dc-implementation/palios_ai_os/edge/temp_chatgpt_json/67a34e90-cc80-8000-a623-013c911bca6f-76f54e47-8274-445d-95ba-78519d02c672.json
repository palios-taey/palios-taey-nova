It\u2019s been a long time since we last connected, maybe since I interviewed with you... I wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is changing the job market faster than anyone is prepared for.\n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my career transformation experiment using AI, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s interesting, a reshare, comment, or even just a like would help get it in front of the right people.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out. It would be good to catch up sometime as well. Let me know what you think.\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks!\n\n\u2014 Jesse"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739210161.594241, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
