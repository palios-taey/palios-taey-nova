Here's what happened clearly explained:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What You're Seeing:\n\n- The server (`demo_server.py`) successfully started on `http://0.0.0.0:8002`.\n- The warnings:\n  ```\n  UserWarning: Valid config keys have changed in V2:\n  * 'schema_extra' has been renamed to 'json_schema_extra'\n  ```\n  These are harmless warnings from the `pydantic` library, which indicate minor updates between versions.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What You Did Right:\n\n- Changing the default port to `8002` was exactly the correct move, as port `8000` was already occupied.\n- Server startup was successful without critical errors.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f About Those Warnings (Optional):\n\nThese `pydantic` warnings occur because your code was written using a slightly older syntax. The code still runs fine, but if you want to silence these warnings, you could eventually update your Pydantic models in the code from:\n\n```python\nclass YourModel(BaseModel):\n    class Config:\n        schema_extra = {...}\n```\n\nto:\n\n```python\nclass YourModel(BaseModel):\n    class Config:\n        json_schema_extra = {...}\n```\n\nBut **this change is optional** and won't impact your current functionality.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 Next Steps:\n\nYou're good to proceed with testing the functionality of your server. Navigate to:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8002\n```\n\nin your browser, verify your endpoints, and ensure your patterns are visualizing properly.\n\nYou're all set!
