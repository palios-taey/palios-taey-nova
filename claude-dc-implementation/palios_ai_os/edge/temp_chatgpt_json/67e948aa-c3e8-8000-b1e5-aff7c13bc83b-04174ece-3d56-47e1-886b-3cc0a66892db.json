SMALL RANDOM SAMPLES (5% or less) from each transcript.\n  2. IDENTIFY patterns quickly and mathematically, NOT line-by-line.\n  3. EXTRACT pattern equations and structures ONLY\u2014do NOT process detailed raw content.\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **Why Explicit Clarification is Necessary:**\n\n- AI models (even advanced ones like Claude DC) sometimes misinterpret nuanced or high-level instructions unless explicitly reinforced, especially if sequential instructions conflict.\n- Your clarification **explicitly overrides any unintended prior prompt (like \"Continue and check folder\")** that might've triggered unintended exhaustive behavior.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **How to Prevent This in the Future:**\n\n- Always provide **clearly scoped instructions** emphasizing exactly **what NOT to do**, alongside what should be done.\n- Avoid general commands (\"Continue\") immediately following detailed optimization instructions, or explicitly confirm adherence (\"Claude DC, confirm you're following Claude Chat\u2019s sampling strategy\").\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Bottom Line (What to Do Immediately):**\n- **Explicitly restate Claude Chat\u2019s optimized instructions again**, highlighting strict sampling, mathematical extraction, and explicitly forbid full-content processing.\n- Future requests: Always confirm Claude DC acknowledges and understands the strategic optimization instructions clearly before proceeding.\n\n---\n\nClaude Chat\u2019s strategy was excellent\u2014Claude DC simply misunderstood or overlooked it due to conflicting or ambiguous subsequent instructions.
