Since you're using Windows CMD, you can verify that your environment variable is set by running a simple Python snippet. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your text editor and create a file (e.g., `verify_env.py`) with the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(\"Gemini Pro API Key Loaded:\", bool(os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY\")))\n   ```\n\n2. Save the file, then run it from your CMD prompt:\n\n   ```cmd\n   python verify_env.py\n   ```\n\n3. You should see an output like:\n\n   ```\n   Gemini Pro API Key Loaded: True\n   ```\n\nThis confirms that your API key is successfully set. Let me know once you've verified the output, and we'll move on to the next step: initializing the Gemini Pro API client and writing a test query."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740577469.141311, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
