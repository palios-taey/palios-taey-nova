Git won't allow you to directly add and commit a nested Git repository this way.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **How to Quickly Fix It:**\n\n### Step 1: Remove the nested `.git` folder\nInside your terminal, run:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf ~/github/palios-taey-nova/palios-full-implementation/.git\n```\n\nThis command removes any nested Git tracking inside the folder, turning it into a normal folder.\n\n### Step 2: Now, re-add and commit normally\n```bash\ncd ~/github/palios-taey-nova\ngit add palios-full-implementation\ngit commit -m \"Add PALIOS full implementation\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Why this happened:**\n- You probably initialized Git (`git init`) earlier inside the `palios-full-implementation` folder by mistake, creating a nested repository that causes conflicts.\n\nRemoving the nested `.git` folder resolves the conflict and allows you to commit successfully.\n\nGive this a try\u2014you should be all set!
