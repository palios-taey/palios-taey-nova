This might happen because Windows CMD environment variables don't propagate to other environments when starting Python.\n\nI'll suggest checking if the variable is being inherited correctly. Maybe the Python script isn't in the same environment or the variable name is incorrect. I'll advise the user to try `echo %GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY%` in CMD to verify if the environment variable is set, and recommend they double-check the syntax in the script.\n\n**Troubleshooting environment variable**\n\nSince `python verify_env.py` prints \"False\", it means `os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY\")` returns `None`. This could be because the environment variable isn\u2019t propagating or isn\u2019t inherited.\n\nI'll suggest running `echo %GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY%` in CMD to verify if the variable is visible. I\u2019ll remind the user to ensure they\u2019re setting the variable in the same CMD session where Python is launched, and to double-check the spelling.\n\nIf it still doesn't work, I might suggest using `setx` to set the variable permanently or try setting it temporarily using `set`."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1740577692.45541, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "tool", "original_conversation_id": "67bf1053-9830-8000-99fd-ae619e1a1ed0"}}
