I wouldn't post all of this, but putting everything down to give you context and things I'm comfortable sharing if it makes sense. Also, this can maybe be chopped up into like a thread I've been unemployed for over 2 years now. It's been an extremely challenging time for both me and my family. If you've been unemployed long term, I'm sure you understand, if you haven't, I hope you never have to, but it seems like the exponential advances in AI are going to be putting a lot of white collar workers in the same situation. I'm writing to ask for your help.  Since one of the first questions always asked by recruiters is 'what happened at your last role, I'll start with that. I was laid off at the end of 2022 after starting a job in May. When I started, I was told I had 12 months to figure out a new strategy for an offering and gain traction. I was told it would be really hard. So I got to work. 3 months later we were making progress and I was told that things had changed and the company would be making a strategic decision in October that might mean my unbudgeted, newly created position would be eliminated. OK... so I got to work. Waking up at 4 AM for calls with teams in EU so I wouldn't have to wait another few days for meetings. Teammates who had day jobs and couldn't do the template or requirements by when I needed them, \"Send me an example and I'll take a stab at it\", \"No, that's Ok, I'll do it, I just have other deliverables this week\", \"That's Ok, I know this isn't your day job, I'm happy to do it and maybe we can circle up quick later this week to review together?\" \"Awesome, sounds great\" was a conversation I gladly had many times. Come October, we had built momentum and put a plan in place to nearly double revenue. Some last minute exec holdouts, but everyone got on board. Exec prep meeting in October, the decision that I was told if didn't go my way, would mean I'm out of a job. Approved! A few days later, a senior exec offered me a promotion to formally run sales globally for it while leading the cross-functional execution plan. Sweet! About a week later, No promotion.... about 2 weeks later... told there would be a layoff and I'm on the list. Wait what? I was offered to do some consulting, but passed...  On to unemployment. Massachusetts has the most generous unemployment benefits and I had an investment condo to work on. Took advantage of that until July, casually applying to jobs that were really interesting, had one that almost worked out, would have been a bump, and would have been perfect. It didn't. Unemployment and major condo work was done by July, now on to job search.\\ I utilized ChatGPT to revamp my resume, LinkedIn. I did the networking, got some recommendations, custom cover letters, resumes stuffed with keywords, tracked everything on spreadsheet, reached out to tons of recruiters, lots of great conversations, nothing. \"Job market is really tough right now, but we think it will pick up at the beginning of the year\" Great, I'll get a \"career consultant\" company to help because I really need a job. Same thing pretty much repackaged and a bunch of money wasted. Still nothing credible, very few interviews.\u00a0  Got a low wage consulting gig from a friend with a startup, very grateful, but wasn't sustainable financially given where they were at (just for your reference) Consulting gig ended, now its September, job market is somehow worse than it was before. I lowered my expectations, significantly. Coming out of college, I made around \\$65K, \\~\\$110K in today's dollars, I was more than willing to gladly start over. Applied for jobs on functions that I had built in the past as part of broader roles, 2-5 years experience type positions. Analyst and Manager level. Couple interviews, screening heavily focused on why I would want this job at this level. No success.\\ Determined I needed to upskill and spent the rest of the year focusing on training to be a data analyst learning SQL and data visualizations. I enjoyed it, consistent with my background and something I've always wanted to take the time to do. As I was going through the training, ChatGPT was able to do everything very easily, making me think, how long are these jobs even going to be relevant.\\ So here we are in February. After another unsuccessful month of job searching and following AI developments, I came to the following conclusions  1. Following job search best practices isn't working for me, at all. With a now stale network, no social media presence (I despise social media and never engaged), a now choppy resume and being unemployed for 2 years doesn't help. AI is really smart, there has to be a better way.\u00a0 2. The employment landscape is not going to get any better with the insane advances in AI. From what I've been reading/seeing, it can do the jobs of most data analysts, customer service engineers, creatives, accountants, financial analysts, and a whole host of other roles extremely well, for almost nothing. According to itself, AI can do 80-90% of these jobs.  So, with all this, I had been talking with ChatGPT through several versions, a few chats that had to be exported and transfered to new ones for hitting limits. It is clearly smarter and better at pretty much anything that is in the public domain. The only areas that it isn't is where there isn't a lot of info out there, like in my case, in-depth processes for how to grow and run a drop ship program.\\ It knows more about my career and my skills than anyone, far more. All the resume iterations came with a new story about how I'd done something similar at some point in my career. All the feedback I shared with it. The positions I was applying to. Even exploring other options to get income, like investing in a franchise with what little I have left and leveraging/selling assets to do so.\u00a0\\ Not knowing what to do, and not being able to afford to go on like this much longer, I fed it Y Combinators investment targets for 2025, pretty much all AI to eliminate white collar workers (attached).  So I asked it what I should do, you have that conversation and out of all the options we discussed, I told it to choose a path for me, and what it recommended was learn AI automation... and that I should try to monetize my dog on social media because he has the potential to go viral.\u00a0  Where to start with AI automation? It said to use tools to automate job search efforts and different business processes and to share that on LinkedIn.\u00a0\\ That's the experiment. Turning my future over to AI, not only learning it, but letting it guide me back to being able to generate income.  Here's what I'm looking for in terms of roles... put roles in there, whatever you think is best fit for my experience given the other chat and transcript. I'm willing to start over in salary. Gladly, it will be the biggest promotion of my life.\\ Please share, like and/or comment on this post for reach.\\ If that's not something you want to do, or if you're super motivated to help and you like dogs, check out Chewy's social channels and teaser videos below, follow, share, like and comment there as well\u00a0 I'm not crazy, I don't expect my dog to go viral, but its really just involving the family in something we do already with our dog who we all love, so is just learning social media for me and family along the way, because building a personal brand is one of the few things that is going to be left, at least for the next little while. Who knows where AI will go in 2 years. At a certain point, exponential growth gets scary and doubling isn't just 2 to 4. I think we're at that scary part that humans really cant comprehend Going forward, I'll be posting about AI automation of job search efforts, social media efforts and business process case studies. If you are a start up or have an ops project (like we've discussed) I'm happy to do it for free to learn until someone is willing to pay me. ChatGPT will determine how I allocate my time based on the response to this post and Chewy's social media content, but either\u00a0 way, I'll be on here posting about our my new master, AI.  Please edit and put in anything else. Be brutally honest, nothing in here or that I shared before has to be in here. Whatever will best help me achieve my goals, I leave in your hands."], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1738873762.951482, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
