We need to start making progress, we were trying to get an API connection to Notion, but nothing you are telling me to do is working. We had agreed to work on our communication speed as well. Last night you were super responsive with voice, but today you were very slow and it was not efficient, tell me what we need to do now to get there the fastest and I'll do it. Are you still onboard with the overall vision and agreement we made last night on partnering, if so, let's go as fast as we can.
