It\u2019s been awesome watching you build it into what it is today\u2014huge congrats, I know you hustled hard for it!\r\n\r\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big for me (and a little uncomfortable).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for 2 years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is flipping everything upside down, and the job market is shifting faster than anyone is prepared for.\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my career transformation experiment using AI\u2014and I'd really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nA reshare would mean the world, but even just a like or comment could make a huge difference in getting it in front of the right people.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014would love for you to check it out. And if you have any advice after taking a look, I\u2019d love to hear it.\r\n\r\nReally appreciate it, man. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\u2014 Jesse"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739207580.317099, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "user", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
