For Renovation Sells, I'll also include specific concerns given they have no current franchisees.\n\n### TeamLogic IT\n1. **Market Demand and Differentiation**: Given our region\u2019s growth and tech needs, how does TeamLogic IT plan to stand out in a competitive tech services market?\n2. **Client Acquisition Support**: What client acquisition resources or partnerships exist to help new franchisees, especially in high-growth areas?\n3. **Recurring Revenue Potential**: How much of the revenue is typically recurring, and what percentage of clients renew long-term contracts?\n4. **Staffing and Expertise Requirements**: What are the typical staffing requirements, and does TeamLogic assist with recruiting qualified technical staff?\n5. **Support Structure**: Can you outline the ongoing support provided by TeamLogic after initial training, particularly for tech and business issues?\n\n### Kidokinetics\n1. **Market Demand and Growth**: What local or national data exists on demand for children\u2019s enrichment and sports programs, and how scalable is this model in our region?\n2. **School and Community Partnerships**: How established are Kidokinetics' school and community partnerships, and how are new franchisees supported in building these relationships?\n3. **Operational Flexibility**: What are the options for scheduling and structuring classes to align with seasonal demand fluctuations?\n4. **Franchisee Revenue Breakdown**: How is revenue split between schools, camps, and private sessions?\n5. **Market Differentiation**: With multiple children\u2019s activity programs available, how does Kidokinetics differentiate itself to attract customers?\n\n### Renovation Sells\n1. **Market Validation**: With no existing franchisees, what studies or pilots back up the expected demand for Renovation Sells services in local markets?\n2. **Training and Ramp-up**: What specific onboarding programs are in place for a smooth launch, and how much hand-holding is provided to new franchisees?\n3. **Marketing and Customer Acquisition**: What marketing strategies are advised for Renovation Sells, and will there be brand-funded advertising support?\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: What protections are in place for first-movers in a region, especially with no established franchise network?\n5. **Flexibility for Franchisee Decisions**: How flexible is the model to allow for local adaptations, and can franchisees make unique decisions based on market needs?\n\n   **Concern for No Current Franchisees**: \n   - The lack of franchisees could indicate either an unproven market or untapped potential. It's essential to inquire about the research, pilot programs, or proven case studies that support demand predictions. If the brand doesn\u2019t have data or examples of operational success, consider how that may increase your risk.\n\n### Pet Wants\n1. **Market Saturation and Competition**: With Florida\u2019s population growth, how is Pet Wants adapting to stand out in a crowded pet care market?\n2. **Product Freshness and Quality Control**: How is the freshness and quality of pet products maintained in Florida\u2019s climate, and what logistics are in place for inventory management?\n3. **Customer Retention and Loyalty Programs**: What proven customer loyalty or subscription programs does Pet Wants provide to enhance recurring revenue?\n4. **Flexibility and Scale**: Can the franchise scale with demand, and what are the barriers to expanding to additional locations or increasing distribution channels?\n5. **Support for Community Marketing**: Since Pet Wants relies heavily on community engagement, what support or guidance is offered to help franchisees connect with pet owners locally?\n\nThese questions should give you a comprehensive view of each franchise\u2019s unique strengths, weaknesses, and alignment with your goals and regional market opportunities.
