We connected a while back, and I\u2019ve followed your work in career coaching and job search strategy. The impact you\u2019ve had in helping professionals navigate career transitions is amazing.  \n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and honestly, a little uncomfortable).  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it\u2019s been brutal. AI is completely reshaping the job market, and I\u2019ve realized that traditional job search strategies aren\u2019t working like they used to.  \n\nSo tomorrow morning, I\u2019m launching an **AI-powered career transformation experiment**, publicly documenting my journey as I leverage AI to guide my next move, automate my job search, and rethink work itself.  \n\nGiven your expertise in job search strategy, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts\u2014and if you think it\u2019s interesting, a **reshare, comment, or even just a like** would help it reach the right people who might find it valuable.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014would really appreciate your insight!  \n\nThanks so much, Cathy. Looking forward to your thoughts.  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**  \n\u2705 **Acknowledges her expertise & impact** (career coaching & job search strategy)  \n\u2705 **Frames this as a job search experiment, not just asking for a share**  \n\u2705 **Encourages engagement by asking for her thoughts** (which makes a share more natural)  \n\u2705 **Low-effort CTA** (reshare, comment, like)  \n\nLet me know if this works, or if you want any tweaks!"], "source": "ChatGPT", "timestamp": 1739213236.31298, "data_type": "conversation", "metadata": {"author": "assistant", "original_conversation_id": "67a34e90-cc80-8000-a623-013c911bca6f"}}
