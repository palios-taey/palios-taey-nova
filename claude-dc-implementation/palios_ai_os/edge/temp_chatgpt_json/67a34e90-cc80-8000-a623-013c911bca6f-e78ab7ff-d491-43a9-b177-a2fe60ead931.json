For example, AI can do everything with data analytics that I was training to be able to do and now is even more powerful with it's coding capabilities. \n\nBased on the chat I sent, what I'm currently thinking is the following:\n1. My dream outcome would be to be able to monetize chewy to the point where I could open a doggie bar down the street. It would be perfect for the heavy drinking, dog owning beach community I live in.\n2. I believe that virtually all white collar work will become obsolete soon, and that as companies continue to adopt AI, that there will continue to be white collar positions eliminated, flooding the market with candidates and making it impossible for someone who has been unemployed for 2+years with a stale network to get a job.\n3. I believe that maybe the only area that is understaffed in white collar are professionals who can implement emerging AI technologies rapidly.\n4. If I am to get a job, I need to be utilizing AI aggressively to reduce my time spent on outreach, applying, who knows, maybe even interviewing.\n5. I have an idea to turn career and side project planning over to you to guide me and then making a post on LinkedIn about some thoughts on my current situation, and experiment in using AI to guide me, posting the AI automation I am doing that would consist of my AI enhanced job search efforts, learning AI for typical business processes that I have done throughout my career and social media efforts. I have seen many of these \"I've applied to millions of jobs and I'm scared of losing my house\" posts.\n\nWhat do you think, honestly? So overall, approach would be to continue to work on Chewy, most of the time spent would be replacement of current family time, for example, we already go on a beach walk every day and play with him, now we're just filming it and all helping with content editing, while pursuing agressively AI automation and sharing it in hopes of landing a job with a company focused on creating or implementing AI.
