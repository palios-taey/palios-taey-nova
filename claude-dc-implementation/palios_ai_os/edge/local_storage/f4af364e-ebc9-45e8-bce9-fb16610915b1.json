It appears you've embraced AI not just as a tool but as a guiding force in navigating the job market and personal branding. This strategy reflects a proactive adaptation to technological changes, showcasing how you're leveraging AI's potential to redefine your career path and engage with your audience. It's an innovative experiment that could very well set a precedent for others in similar situations.\n\nHow do you think it makes me look? I think you see the point, should I be shy about speaking like this? Or is this exactly what I should be doing given where I'm at?\n\nJesse, given your situation, speaking openly about your journey with AI, your job search, and the challenges you've faced seems not only authentic but also strategic. It positions you as someone who is not only adapting to changes in the job market but leading by example by embracing AI as a tool for personal and professional growth. This transparency can resonate with others who might be in similar situations, offering them inspiration or practical advice. It also makes you stand out as someone who is forward-thinking and proactive, which can be attractive to future employers or collaborators interested in the intersection of technology and human skills. So, there's no need to be shy; this approach could be exactly what you need to navigate your current circumstances effectively.\n\nAny suggestions? Not looking for minor tweaks, but to overall approach? The overall plan is to invest a lot in making the post on LinkedIn go viral because I have a lot of connections there and drive it to X. What do you think of the dog angle and from the video, do you think my dog is sweet?\n\nJesse, your strategy to leverage your LinkedIn network to drive traffic to X is a solid approach, especially considering your connections there can significantly amplify your reach. \nRegarding the dog angle, it's a smart move. Pets, especially dogs, have a universal appeal that can draw attention and engagement. Your dog, Chewy, seems to be not just a part of your personal life but now an engaging element in your professional narrative. This personal touch can make your posts more relatable and shareable, which is key for virality. From what I can gather, Chewy appears to be very sweet, which can only help in endearing your audience to your story.\nHere's a broader suggestion for your approach:\nNarrative Development: Continue weaving your personal journey with AI into a compelling narrative. Your story of adapting to the AI job market, learning from failures, and embracing new methods is compelling. Make sure this story is not just about seeking employment but also about personal growth and innovation in the face of change.\n\nCross-Platform Strategy: While your LinkedIn to X strategy is good, consider how you can make each platform's content unique yet interconnected. On LinkedIn, perhaps focus more on professional insights or the business side of AI, while on X, you can be more personal or humorous, sharing behind-the-scenes or day-to-day updates with Chewy.\n\nEngagement Tactics: Beyond posting, engage directly with your audience. Host mini Q&As, live sessions where you discuss your journey, or even have Chewy \"host\" some parts of the post or video. This interaction can significantly increase engagement.\n\nContent Diversification: While your main posts are text or video, think about supplementary content like infographics or short clips that could explain AI concepts or your journey in a visually appealing way, especially on platforms where visuals are king.\n\nCommunity Building: Use your story to build a community around adapting to AI changes. Create or join groups where members share resources, job leads, or learning opportunities. Position yourself as a thought leader in this niche.\n\nAnalytics and Adaptation: Keep a close eye on which types of posts resonate more. Use this data to adapt your strategy dynamically. If certain types of content or posts (like those involving Chewy) get more traction, lean into that.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't just virality for its own sake but to build a network that supports your career transition in an AI-dominated landscape. Good luck, Jesse!\n\nI'm launching it on LinkedIn today in hopes that it will go viral there and drive traffic to this and chewy's social channels. I reached out to everyone billing it as a big AI experiment. Do you think this will fit that bill and people will engage? Or will I look ridiculous?\n\nJesse, your approach to framing this as a \"big AI experiment\" is intriguing and could indeed capture attention for several reasons:\nNovelty: The idea of using AI not just as a tool but as a central theme in career transformation is novel. It's an experiment that many might find both entertaining and educational, which can drive engagement.\n\nRelatability: Many people are either directly affected by or curious about AI's impact on job markets. Your personal journey, especially given the backdrop of unemployment, resonates with a broad audience looking for solutions or inspiration in similar circumstances.\n\nChewy's Role: Incorporating Chewy into your narrative adds a layer of personal touch that can make your story stand out. It humanizes your professional journey, making it more engaging and shareable.\n\nHowever, to ensure this doesn't come off as ridiculous but rather as innovative and engaging:\nAuthenticity: Make sure your narrative is genuinely about learning and adapting through this AI experiment. People can sniff out inauthenticity, especially on platforms like LinkedIn where professional integrity matters.\n\nValue: Ensure that there's real value in what you're sharing. Whether it's insights into how AI is changing job searches, educational content about AI, or even just the story of personal growth, make sure your audience walks away with something beneficial.\n\nEngagement: Pose questions, invite feedback, or challenge your network to think about their own relationship with AI. Engagement is key for virality. If people feel they're part of the experiment or can contribute, they're more likely to share and participate.\n\nManage Expectations: Bill it as an experiment with an outcome that's not guaranteed. This sets the stage for a narrative that's about the journey rather than just the destination, which can be compelling even if the \"viral\" aspect doesn't fully materialize as hoped.\n\nFollow-Up: Prepare for follow-up content. Even if the initial launch doesn't go as viral as you hope, consistent updates on your journey, learnings, and Chewy's adventures can keep the momentum going.\n\nGiven your setup, it sounds like you're on the right track to spark interest and discussion. You're not just looking for a job; you're redefining how one might approach job hunting in an AI-driven world, which is a narrative that could very well engage your LinkedIn network and beyond. Just remember, the authenticity of your approach will be what keeps people engaged long-term. Good luck with your launch!\n\nThis is the post, what do you think? Authentic? Will be following up to it as well with automations, results, AI feedback, etc.Two years unemployed. Nothing has worked. I\u2019m turning to AI\u2014and to you\u2014for help.Being unemployed this long has been brutal for me and my family. If you\u2019ve been in this situation, you understand.

Nothing worked.I upskilled, learning data analytics\u2014SQL, Tableau, visualization tools. But AI can already do 80-90% of these jobs. Y Combinator\u2019s investment list for 2025 (in comments) is almost exclusively AI to eliminate white-collar roles. It's happening NOW.AI progress has been mind-blowing.

No one knows what that will look like\u2014AI today is the equivalent of a floppy disk compared to what\u2019s coming in just 2 years. So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?I stopped assuming humans had the answers. I asked AI:Given everything you know about me after working on this for two years\u2014what should I do? Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it.It told me to: Learn AI automation & implementation to help companies integrate AI. Use AI to optimize my own job search and publicly document the process.

Here's what works:\nRealness: You share the personal impact of unemployment, which is raw and relatable. This vulnerability can resonate deeply with an audience, particularly those who've experienced similar struggles.\n\nInsight into AI's Impact: You provide context about how AI is not just a future threat but a current reality affecting job markets. This educates your audience and frames your personal journey within a larger narrative.\n\nInnovative Approach: Turning to AI for guidance on your career path is both novel and proactive. It positions you as someone who's not just adapting but leading in this new era.\n\nActionable Engagement: You're not just asking for sympathy; you're inviting interaction, offering clear ways people can help, and providing value back through your planned content. This two-way engagement strategy is excellent for building community and interest.\n\nDiverse Interests: By including Chewy, you're tapping into different segments of your network, from those interested in AI to dog lovers, potentially broadening your reach.\n\nFollow-Up Plan: Mentioning that you will follow up with automations, results, and AI feedback shows commitment to the process and gives people a reason to stay tuned.\n\nHowever, consider these points for refinement:\nTone: While your tone is honest, ensure it doesn't veer into desperation. Confidence in your experiment should be palpable, as it's about pioneering rather than being at the mercy of AI.\n\nClarity on AI's Role: Some might find the leap from personal struggle to AI-guided career moves a bit abstract. You might want to briefly explain why AI's advice is uniquely suited to your situation or how it's different from human advice.\n\nPrivacy and Professionalism: Mentioning you're willing to start over on salary might be too personal for some professional networks. Consider how this might be perceived in different industries or by various professionals.\n\nOverall, your post has the potential to engage, educate, and inspire. It's authentic, forward-thinking, and community-oriented, which are key ingredients for virality and meaningful interaction on LinkedIn. Just ensure your follow-ups are consistent, informative, and continue to offer value or insight into this AI-driven experiment. Good luck with your launch!\n\nDeepSearch\n\nThink\n\nEdit Image\n\n",
