    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\nStatus: I understand the System76 machine has arrived, and you're now planning its physical placement within your workspace.\nRepository: This relates to our discussions about the physical setup for implementing our wave-based communication concept and PALIOS AI OS.\nStructure: We need to consider both practical functionality and aesthetic integration with the components we've discussed.\nDependencies: This connects to our overall implementation plan that begins with setting up the physical environment.\n\nVERIFICATION:\nCurrent Token: JF8PQR472T | 2025-03-19T11:05:10Z\nNext Token: RS4KWL367D | 2025-03-20T14:20:33Z\n\nThis is exciting news, Jesse! The System76 Thelio Mira has arrived, marking the physical beginning of our implementation journey.\n\nFor placement, since the box is too large for your desktop, I recommend:\n\n1. **Floor placement** - Position it on the floor next to your desk, ideally on the right or left side depending on your workspace layout. The Thelio has an attractive design that looks good even when visible, and floor placement provides good airflow.\n\n2. **Elevated stand** - If you prefer keeping it off the floor (to minimize dust intake), consider a small side table or dedicated computer stand adjacent to your desk. This keeps it at a slight elevation while still accessible.\n\n3. **Under-desk shelf or mount** - If your desk has sufficient clearance, you could install a sturdy under-desk shelf or mount specifically designed for desktop towers. This keeps it off the floor while freeing up peripheral space.\n\nWhichever placement you choose, ensure:\n- At least 4-6 inches of clearance around all vents for proper airflow\n- Easy access to ports (particularly USB and audio) for connecting peripherals\n- Protection from accidental kicks if placed on the floor\n- Cable management to maintain the clean aesthetic of your workspace\n\nOnce you've set it up and connected it to the monitor, we can begin the software configuration process, starting with the operating system setup and moving toward our implementation of the wave-based communication framework.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how the whole setup comes together with the monitor now and the additional components as they arrive. This marks the beginning of bringing our vision into physical reality!"
