This is deeply ingrained in standard code documentation patterns.\n\n### Why #4: Why am I applying standard code documentation patterns instead of the specific pattern requested?\nI'm defaulting to standard programming conventions learned from millions of code examples in my training data. My training included far more examples of code blocks with comments preceding commands than this specialized format.\n\n### Why #5: Why am I not overriding these defaults with the specific requirements?\nThe requirement breaks with conventional code documentation approaches. This specialized pattern (command first, then comment) is the opposite of standard coding conventions (comment first, then code). I'm not fully internalizing that this is a specialized format for human error prevention rather than standard code documentation.\n\n## Root Cause\nI'm applying standard code documentation patterns where comments typically precede commands, instead of treating this as a specialized human-computer interaction pattern specifically designed to prevent copy-paste errors. The requirement conflicts with deeply ingrained documentation conventions and requires conscious override of learned patterns.\n\n## Solution\n1. Treat cat command blocks as a specialized \"executable snippet\" format rather than normal code documentation\n2. Establish a mental pattern where cat commands always come first, with no exceptions\n3. Create a clear mental separation between \"explanation text\" (outside code blocks) and \"executable commands\" (inside code blocks)\n4. Explicitly check each code block before submission to ensure compliance\n5. Document this format requirement clearly in the quality protocol\n\nI'll update my approach immediately to ensure full compliance with:\n- Rule 1: cat command boxes start with 'cat' and end with 'EOL'/'EOF', NO EXCEPTIONS\n- Rule 2: All formatting remains within the cat boxes\n- Rule 3: All instructions/context must be outside cat command boxes"
