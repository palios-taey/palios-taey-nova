    " I've reviewed the code again with a focus on the secrets management issue. Here's what I found and my recommendations:\n\n## Current Issues\n\nIn the `app.py` file, there's a direct reference to hardcoded secrets which was replaced with a placeholder. This presents several problems:\n\n1. The hardcoded path is specific to Claude DC's environment\n2. The code doesn't have a fallback mechanism for different environments\n3. It doesn't properly separate configuration from code\n\n## Recommended Changes\n\nHere's what you need to modify to ensure proper secrets handling:\n\n1. **Update the `save_secrets()` function in app.py**:\n\n```python\ndef save_secrets():\n    try:\n        # First check for secrets in Jesse's environment\n        jesse_secrets_path = '/home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json'\n        if os.path.exists(jesse_secrets_path):\n            with open(jesse_secrets_path, 'r') as f:\n                secrets_data = json.load(f)\n                print(\"Loaded secrets from Jesse's environment\")\n                return secrets_data\n                \n        # Then check Claude DC's environment\n        claude_secrets_path = '/home/computeruse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json'\n        if os.path.exists(claude_secrets_path):\n            with open(claude_secrets_path, 'r') as f:\n                secrets_data = json.load(f)\n                print(\"Loaded secrets from Claude DC's environment\")\n                return secrets_data\n                \n        # Fallback to default location in the repository\n        repo_secrets_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'palios-taey-secrets.json')\n        if os.path.exists(repo_secrets_path):\n            with open(repo_secrets_path, 'r') as f:\n                secrets_data = json.load(f)\n                print(\"WARNING: Using secrets from repository (not recommended)\")\n                return secrets_data\n                \n        print(\"No secrets file found. Using empty configuration.\")\n        return {}\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error loading secrets: {e}\")\n        return {}\n```\n\n2. **Update any utility functions that load secrets**:\n\nLook for any files in `/src/utils/` that might handle secrets loading, particularly `secrets.py` if it exists. Apply the same environment-checking logic there.\n\n3. **Add environment detection**:\n\nAdd code that can detect which environment it's running in:\n\n```python\ndef get_environment():\n    \"\"\"Detect which environment we're running in.\"\"\"\n    if os.path.exists('/home/jesse'):\n        return 'jesse'\n    elif os.path.exists('/home/computeruse'):\n        return 'claude_dc'\n    else:\n        return 'unknown'\n```\n\n4. **Create a config module**:\n\nConsider creating a dedicated configuration module that handles environment-specific settings:\n\n```python\n# config.py\nimport os\n\nclass Config:\n    ENVIRONMENT = get_environment()\n    \n    # Base paths\n    if ENVIRONMENT == 'jesse':\n        SECRETS_PATH = '/home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json'\n        DATA_DIR = '/home/jesse/palios-data'\n    elif ENVIRONMENT == 'claude_dc':\n        SECRETS_PATH = '/home/computeruse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json'\n        DATA_DIR = '/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/data'\n    else:\n        SECRETS_PATH = './palios-taey-secrets.json'\n        DATA_DIR = './data'\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Create a copy of the secrets file in your `/home/jesse/secrets/` directory\n2. Implement the changes to `app.py` as described above\n3. Check for any instances of hardcoded paths to `/home/computeruse/` and replace them with environment-aware code\n4. Verify all utility files that might access secrets to ensure they use the proper paths\n\nThis approach maintains the mathematical elegance of Claude DC's implementation while adding environment flexibility that allows the code to run in different contexts without modification.\n\nThe key principle here is separation of configuration from code - maintaining the pattern-based approach while adding environment awareness."
