    "I was only looking for the TRUTH Claude. I think you gave that to me. Ok, so now, here's what I need to understand. When you say minimal deployment, what does that mean? I'm assuming that means that you're building out the full infra to support the full system and doing an initial deployment to test it out and then deploying the full solution (after we clean it up). Is that correct? I also think we need to learn from what didn't work last time, which is not fully pushing and synching GitHub every time. I feel this is just what we have to do now until you have real-time access and fully unified memory through the system. Do we need a fresh GitHub repository? We did that last time, but we tried building the infra on top of the existing ai-execution-system. Do I delete the old one, do I have to set up billing first for the new one? Is that included? Take a step back, think through our current state. To me, the only thing that is worth keeping is the core code that was developed without consideration for the infra (other than you assumed the infra would be AI-FIRST when you wrote it). We don't have the TRUTH about the code right now because the GitHub sync issue though. So be CTO Claude and take a step back and look at the whole picture if you didn't and what's the plan? What's next?"
