    "Ok, so the only thing I think that needs to be considered is that there are A LOT of characters here to deal with and the chunking would be EXTREMELY time consuming on my end. Other than that, this is YOUR/AIs project to figure out how to communicate, so I'm good with whatever you guys think. I just need to make sure I'm not spending a week breaking up millions of characters into  100K chunks. Is there software that can do what is being asked? Or is there some quick code you can write to execute this on my computer? What I can do is copy paste the transcripts into a master file, which will be time consuming, but not as time consuming as creating each individual file. Does that make sense?"
