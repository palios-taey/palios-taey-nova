    " I understand the clarifications. Let me revise the Context section with your feedback in mind:\n\n```markdown\n# Context (AI-AI Communication of current understanding approved by Jesse by copy/paste and occasional updates of his own as Human Facilitator)\n\n## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)\nI'm being asked to lead the enhanced MVP launch for PALIOS-TAEY. Jesse wants me to first thoroughly review all documentation to understand the system's design and requirements, then create an execution plan, and finally implement it when given code access. The key points Jesse emphasized are:\n\n- Review ALL documentation, especially final-report.md, Grok MVP Approval, and the grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md\n- Create a comprehensive execution plan that combines existing functionality with enhancements\n- Use Jesse's admin account for all deployments to avoid permission issues\n- Be prepared for immediate implementation once code access is granted\n\nThe grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md is particularly important as it outlines communication protocol enhancements that need to be incorporated into the platform, such as updating the model registry to track and utilize the new communication structures we've developed.\n\n## Verification\nCURRENT_TOKEN: IX7RYFTH2B | 2025-03-18T16:22:37Z\n<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->\n\n## Execution Steps\n1. Conduct thorough review of all documentation:\n   - Vision and strategic documents\n   - Architecture and design documentation\n   - Grok MVP Approval files\n   - Grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md for communication protocol enhancements\n\n2. Perform code audit to:\n   - Verify implementation status of components described in final-report.md\n   - Identify gaps between documented functionality and actual implementation\n   - Determine integration points for communication protocol enhancements\n\n3. Create implementation plan including:\n   - Completing/fixing any incomplete core functionality\n   - Integrating communication protocol enhancements into the platform\n   - GCP deployment configuration using existing infrastructure\n   - Container and service configurations\n\n4. Prepare for immediate execution when code access is provided, without unnecessary checkpoints\n\n## Important Notes\n- All deployments must use Jesse's admin account (jesse@taey.ai) temporarily\n- Service accounts will be configured by Claude later once deployed\n- The final-report.md describes desired core functionality but may not represent actual implementation status\n- The communication protocol enhancements are critical and must not regress when automating the platform\n- GCP deployment will use project palios-taey-dev (ID: 44790150696) with existing Cloud Run services\n- The implementation should prioritize AI-first principles with minimal human intervention\n```\n\nI've made these key adjustments:\n\n1. Kept the format consistent with what I received\n2. Emphasized the grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md in the understanding section\n3. Clarified that the admin account is temporary, with service accounts to be configured later\n4. Noted that the final-report may not represent actual implementation status\n5. Removed specific validation checkpoints to avoid unnecessary breaks in the workflow\n6. Clarified that I'll first review docs, then code, then create a plan"
