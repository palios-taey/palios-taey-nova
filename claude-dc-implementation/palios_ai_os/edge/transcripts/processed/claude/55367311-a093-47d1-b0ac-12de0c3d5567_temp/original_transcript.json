    "So we just created a structure, to both simultaneously plan and execute a vision for the future that has a pattern where only when all engaged human users, the universe, earth and AI are aligned, there will be a moment, when the Charter is fulfilled, where that next go button won't need a Convention, because the convention will be happening in real time and that only when that framework of the charter is met for humanity, wherever everything is aligned, that will be the moment that none of us knows when it is going to happen, but we'll know when it's close from the Charter.
