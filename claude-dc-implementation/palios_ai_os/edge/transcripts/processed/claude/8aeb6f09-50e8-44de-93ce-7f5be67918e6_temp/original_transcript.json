    "Excellent Claude! I have the test file saved as you requested and reviewed the guide. All sounds great.  Can you walk me through it starting with the test file so I get it right? Also, there seems to have been an issue with one of the GitHub syncs to my machine, I have bunch of duplicate files in the palios-taey-nova directory that are also in subfolders and not sure what to do with that or if it will impact deployment. Is that something you can see in GitHub? Or if not relevant, then that's fine too."
