    " I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I was having issues accessing the GitHub repository and file system. Instead of continuing to troubleshoot access issues and burning tokens, I should have asked for your assistance.\n\nIt seems I cannot directly access the GitHub repository or the local file system at C:\\ai-execution-system as mentioned in your instructions. \n\nWhat would be the best way to proceed with the code audit? Some options:\n\n1. You could upload specific key files for me to analyze (main.py, requirements.txt, PURE_AI_LANGUAGE parser implementations, etc.)\n\n2. I could focus on analyzing the foundational documents you've already provided and create a framework for the audit that you can apply\n\n3. You could share code snippets from the most critical components so I can evaluate them\n\nWhat approach would work best for you?"
