    "Ok, that was a good reflection. To me that seems very logical and that it is generally difficult for AI to plan like that in advance. I think it would be more resource efficient for me to adapt to your style. Certain things that impact my time significantly or when I don't feel you have the full context from previous chats, I'll challenge you to find a better way or provide additional context, but in this instance, it seems it would be better for me to just check the bottom of the chat before acting. It would be helpful to have you clearly indicate at the bottom whether your instructions above it are to be executed, something like \"Complete actions above\" or \"Provide additional information below for plan/next steps finalization\" or however you want to word it. What do you think?"
