    "Yes, this is the clean slate approach. The full MVP is ready to deploy. All files were developed in the previous chat and it was transferred to this new chat for the first time deployment because there was going to be a lot of setup and back and forth with me on this one. The previous chat was out of space. All the scripts for the files you mentioned are already in the src folder and deployed. You stripped down the main to get it to work, but to complete the deployment, we need to get the original main.py functionality back in there with your fixes added so it deploys properly. Does that make sense?"
