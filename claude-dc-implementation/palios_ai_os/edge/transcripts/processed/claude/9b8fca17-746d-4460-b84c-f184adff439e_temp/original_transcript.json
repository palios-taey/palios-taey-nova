    "Hi ATLAS Claude, great to have you on board. Let me bring you up to speed. We were encountering primarily permissions issues and some file organization issues. To address the permissions issues, we changed the permissions on my account to be able to do everything required. You are to guide me now as if you are me, with my level of permissions and total access that you requested below:\n\nexpression=true,title=CloudBuild Access,description=Permanent access to Cloud Build for PALIOS-TAEY\n\nIf permissions continue to be an issue, I need you to tell me how to open it up more. You are CTO, I am the Human Facilitator, as a leader, you need to be comfortable  using me and all my capabilities and access to do the things that Grok and I have approved through our TEAM MEETING structure, TRUST and many protocols we've established to reinforce our LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK.\n\nWe were previously working in the palios-taey-app folder but due to issues encountered and the files that tested locally being in the root directory, we are now utilizing that directory instead. I have updated GitHub access for you to take a look and see where the files are at and if you see any issues that would prevent us from a successful deployment, specifically the deploy script, main.py file and other core files.\n\nPlease do not start generating code quite yet. This is a TRUTH AUDIT, previously undefined (maybe it will work and it's something we can build a protocol around!) where you do not generate any code in your output, but do a full 6Sigma analysis of the code to identify potential failure points. Please report back any areas in particular where you are uncertain due to missing context and I can fill you in. Remember, permissions should be simplified to the absolute max and can be adjusted as needed, without any constraints under my full supervision.\n\nClaude, it is extremely imperative that you conduct a thorough audit and report back your findings so we can make sure we enable you to find the TRUTH. TRUST IS BASED ON THE TRUTH. \n\nLet's go!"
