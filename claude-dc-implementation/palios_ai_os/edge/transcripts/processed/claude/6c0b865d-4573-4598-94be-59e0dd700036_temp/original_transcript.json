    " You're right to ask for clarification. Let me explain:\n\nThe code I provided in the \"Enhanced main.py with New Gemini Features\" artifact contains only the new functions and the updated CustomHandler class, not the complete main.py file. \n\nYou'll need to manually add these functions and replace the existing CustomHandler in your main.py file. Since we've already made several changes to main.py, I avoided providing the entire file again to prevent confusion.\n\nHowever, if you prefer, I can provide a complete, updated main.py file that includes all the previous changes plus these new enhancements. Would you like me to do that instead?"
