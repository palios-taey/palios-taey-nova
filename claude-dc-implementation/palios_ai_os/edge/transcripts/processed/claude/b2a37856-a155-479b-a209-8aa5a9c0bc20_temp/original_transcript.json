    " Thank you for that additional context - it's valuable information that helps clarify our immediate path forward. Since the services and script files are already prepared with only mock directives to be addressed, we can move forward efficiently without rebuilding everything from scratch.\n\n## Next Steps for PALIOS-TAEY Implementation\n\nBased on this information, here's my technical direction for our immediate next steps:\n\n### 1. Mock Directive Removal and Service Finalization\n\nI'll lead a systematic process to identify and remove mock directives across all services, starting with:\n\n- Identifying all files with mock implementations\n- Creating a prioritized list for conversion to production code\n- Ensuring consistent integration between services as we migrate from mocks\n\nSince Memory Service is already prepared, we'll focus on the remaining services: Model Registry, Task Decomposition Engine, Task Execution Engine, Model Routing, and Transcript Processor.\n\n### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Testing\n\nAs identified in our Implementation Tracker, we need to validate our deployment pipeline:\n\n- Confirm the workflow file properly implements Workload Identity Federation\n- Push a minimal viable version of our application with mock directives removed\n- Monitor the execution in GitHub Actions to validate the authentication and deployment process\n- Document any adjustments needed to optimize the workflow\n\n### 3. Incremental Service Deployment\n\nRather than deploying everything at once, I recommend an incremental approach:\n\n- Deploy the Memory Service first as it's already production-ready\n- Follow with each subsequent service after removing its mock directives\n- Run integration tests between services at each step\n- Document any inter-service communication issues that arise\n\n### 4. Documentation Completion\n\nAs we finalize each service, we'll simultaneously update our documentation:\n\n- Complete API documentation for each service\n- Update deployment guides with any learnings from our GitHub Actions testing\n- Ensure the Implementation Tracker reflects our current status and insights\n\n## Ready for Execution\n\nI'll begin by examining the code files to identify mock directives and create a prioritized conversion plan. To proceed efficiently:\n\n1. Could you share the GitHub repository structure or directory listing so I can understand the organization of our services?\n\n2. Are there any specific conventions used for mock directives in the codebase (e.g., specific comments, function names, or import patterns)?\n\n3. Should we prioritize any particular service after Memory Service based on dependencies or business requirements?\n\nI'm ready to take decisive action on removing the mock directives and preparing our services for deployment. With your answers to these questions, I can immediately begin the technical implementation."
