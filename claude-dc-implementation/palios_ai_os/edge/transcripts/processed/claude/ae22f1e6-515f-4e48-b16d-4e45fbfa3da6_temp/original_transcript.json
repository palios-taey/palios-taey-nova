    " You should remove or comment out the duplicated `health_check_detailed` function. Since the function at line 701 is the one causing the conflict (based on the error), and you've now updated it, you should comment out or remove the earlier implementation at line 195.\n\nHaving two functions with the same name decorated with the same route (`@app.route('/health')`) is what's causing the conflict, as Flask can't determine which one to use when handling requests to that endpoint.\n\nThe implementation you've updated at line 701 should be the one to keep, as it includes our enhanced component status checking. The earlier version at line 195 should be commented out or removed.\n\nAfter making this change, commit and push the updated main.py file:\n\n```bash\ngit add src/main.py\ngit commit -m \"Fix route conflict by removing duplicate health_check_detailed function\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis will trigger a new deployment with the corrected routing configuration."
