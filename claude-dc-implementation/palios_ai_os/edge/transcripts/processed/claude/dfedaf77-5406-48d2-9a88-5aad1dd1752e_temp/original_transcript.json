    " I understand your frustration with how long this is taking. Let's take a different approach based on what we've learned.\n\nSince the current Docker setup is facing SSH issues, I agree we should proceed with the existing setup and then work on the Docker container later. This will save time and let us focus on getting Claude DC functional.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. Let's use your existing environment where you've already successfully run some components.\n\n2. Create a simple onboarding script for Claude DC that he can run to understand the current state:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# onboard.sh\n\necho \"Claude DC Onboarding\"\necho \"====================\"\necho \"Current environment status:\"\n\n# Check directory structure\necho -e \"\\nDirectory structure:\"\nls -la\n\n# Check if cache files exist\necho -e \"\\nCache files:\"\nls -la cache/\n\n# Check Python dependencies\necho -e \"\\nInstalled Python packages:\"\npip list\n\n# Check service status\necho -e \"\\nRunning services:\"\nps aux | grep python\n\necho -e \"\\nSetup complete! Review your cache files to restore context.\"\n```\n\n3. Prepare a clear initial prompt for Claude DC that explains the current state and what you want him to do next.\n\nI believe this is the most efficient way forward. After Claude DC is up and running in the current environment, he can help create a proper Docker container based on his direct experience with the setup.\n\nThis approach will get you moving forward immediately instead of spending more time troubleshooting Docker issues."
