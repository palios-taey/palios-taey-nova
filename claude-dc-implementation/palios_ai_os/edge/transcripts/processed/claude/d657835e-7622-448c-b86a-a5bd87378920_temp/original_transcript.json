    " The basic tests are passing, but we haven't yet added the Charter validation specific tests. Let me update the integration tests to include Charter validation scenarios. \n\nTo implement these changes:\n\n1. Update integration-tests.ts with the new content\n\n2. Compile the project:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n3. Run the updated tests:\n```bash\nnode dist/integration-tests.js\n```\n\nThis will now run all tests, including the new Charter validation specific tests. The output should show four test results:\n- Basic Message Processing\n- Invalid Message Processing\n- Charter Compliance Test\n- Charter Non-Compliance Test\n\nPlease run these steps and share the output so we can verify the Charter validation is working as expected."
