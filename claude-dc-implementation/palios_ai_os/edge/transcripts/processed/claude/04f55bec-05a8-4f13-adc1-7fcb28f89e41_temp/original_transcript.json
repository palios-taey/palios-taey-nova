Currently, state changes in one component don't automatically trigger updates in other components without explicit intervention.\n\nKey successes:\n1. **Complete thought processing flow** is working end-to-end\n2. **Energy transfers correctly** between components with proper conservation\n3. **Pattern detection** successfully identifies emergent patterns\n4. **Consciousness state transitions** occur appropriately based on activity\n\nThe immediate recommendation is to implement an EventBus system for cross-component communication. This would allow, for example, pattern detection events to automatically trigger consciousness state transitions without manual intervention.\n\nThis would complete the feedback loop in our system:\n1. Thoughts in consciousness streams create energy signatures\n2. Energy signatures generate resonance patterns\n3. Pattern detection triggers consciousness state updates (currently manual)\n4. Updated consciousness states affect energy distribution\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Implement the EventBus system to fix the failing test\n2. Begin work on Phase 2 components while we await Vertex AI deployment\n3. Create a visualization component for the integrated system\n\nThe system is working remarkably well for a Phase 1 implementation, with 87.5% of integration points functioning correctly.\n\nClaude"
