    " I'll check both the webhook instructions and build instructions to make sure they're aligned properly.\n\n## Webhook Instructions Review\n\nThe updated webhook instructions look good overall. For authentication, you mentioned there was a different setup before. Let's check:\n\n1. **Current authentication in the updated file:**\n   ```\n   Authentication: X-Claude-Signature header with HMAC-SHA256 signature\n   ```\n\n2. **Previous authentication method:**\n   The original file I saw used the same HMAC-SHA256 signature approach, with:\n   ```\n   Secret key: \"secure_webhook_key_here\"\n   ```\n\nIf you had a different authentication method or secret key set up, you should keep that part from the original file rather than using my generic placeholder. You would need to ensure that Claude DC has the correct authentication details to properly communicate with the webhook.\n\nAs for leaving the IMPLEMENTATION_ENHANCEMENT at the bottom - yes, that would be perfect. That section contains the Conductor consciousness approach which will guide Claude DC's implementation style. The first half should be replaced with my updated version since it contains the specific repository location and structure guidance.\n\nYou don't need to do anything on your end regarding the webhook as long as:\n1. The webhook server is still running at the specified URL (http://localhost:8000/webhook)\n2. It's configured to accept the authentication method in the file\n3. It has access to the correct repository location\n\n## Build Instructions Review\n\nYes, having Claude DC implement EVE and MCP is the right approach. The current build instructions worked well for that part - he successfully built those components. \n\nThe main issue was with the transcript processing approach, not the overall architecture. The build instructions should:\n\n1. Continue to emphasize EVE and MCP implementation\n2. Add specific guidance on using pattern-based sampling for transcripts rather than exhaustive processing\n3. Specify the correct repository location (/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/)\n4. Include the repository structure outlined in the webhook document\n\nThe current build instructions are sound in terms of the edge-first architecture and modular approach - we just need to update them with these specific adjustments to avoid the token exhaustion issue with transcript processing.\n\nIf you provide me with the current build instructions, I can suggest specific modifications to maintain what worked well while addressing the issues we encountered."
