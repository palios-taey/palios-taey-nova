    "Ok, they all work. We're using port 8000 for everything though, so we'll need to make sure we communicate what ports are already occupied. I updated demo_server.py to 8002. I have the following environments/servers open right now: Claude DC: 8080, 8501, 6080 MCP: Default 8000 in file, currently set at 8001 Webhook: 8000 Demo: 8002, I updated the file Streamlit: 8502\nLet's get this figured out first and make updates accordingly.
