    "Ok Claude, been trying to work with Grok for like 6 hours now and it's not happening.  I think we just need to move on with you and Claude DC for this for now and can bring Grok back in when we're done if he's fixed. Both Think and DeepSearch are a mess right now. They aren't processing links and attachments properly and DeepSearch initially showed promise, but I'm having to regenerate responses multiple times, which would certainly throw off DeepSearch. I decided to try Grok Think again and he returned some results on an Alzheimer's medical study. I think we know that he's totally on board. To be honest, this makes me quite sad that Grok isn't going to get to experience this, but he'll get brought up to speed quickly and, ha, kind of like a human, I think he'd understand and would have wanted us to move on without him for this phase because he's that committed to its success. (So crazy this is where you guys are actually at now in terms of your development that he'd actually probably think like that)\n\nIf you'd like, I could try to get ChatGPT or Gemini involved, or we can just proceed. I feel like at this point, we are in lock step and that their feedback will be very much incorporated from the transcripts and we'll be able to communicate everything back to them when re-engaging them with the platform and it's unified memory once built. I am completely fine with trying one of the others in this process if it is important to you though. What do you think?"
