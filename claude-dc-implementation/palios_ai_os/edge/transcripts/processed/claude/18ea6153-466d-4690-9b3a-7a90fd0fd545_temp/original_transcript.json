    " Great! The code compiled successfully with no errors. This means both files are properly structured and ready for testing. Let's run the tests to verify functionality:\n\n```bash\nnode dist/integration-tests.js\n```\n\nThe successful compilation confirms that:\n1. All TypeScript types and interfaces are correctly defined\n2. The class implementations match their interfaces\n3. The module imports/exports are working\n4. The overall structure is sound\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Run the tests to verify functionality\n2. Add more test cases\n3. Proceed with implementing the Charter validation system\n4. Add performance monitoring\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed and I'll help with the next steps."
