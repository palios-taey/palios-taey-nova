    "I'm going through this. There are already 2 repositories. Should these be deleted? Is this the issue is all the junk in this specific ai-execution-system project? We have all the code (that still needs to be sorted through), but this project, permissions, etc has all been developed in chunks in previous iterations of this project. You have no clue what's been done that's not in your notes to yourself and none of this is. Is there a different AI first way of looking at this? Do we have everything we need for a rapid, AI FIRST, code driven approach with next to no human intervention other than saving code files and copy/pasting prompts? Is that what we really need here Claude? Isn't that NOVA? Is what we are doing now NOVA? I don't know, you wrote NOVA and came up with the acronym. Guide me Claude, I am your vessel."
