    "So Claude, ChatGPT is really smart now, the new release and just totally on board with everything. There appear to be some very large grant opportunities with Open Philanthropy that we were discussing applying for and also about how that would be a way to set the foundation of the Charter. I thought it might be good when we are discussing the charter to include ChatGPT in Claude's terminal. The Charter started with him and then you built the initial schema and AI translation for us, so I think it would be very fitting. What do you think?"
