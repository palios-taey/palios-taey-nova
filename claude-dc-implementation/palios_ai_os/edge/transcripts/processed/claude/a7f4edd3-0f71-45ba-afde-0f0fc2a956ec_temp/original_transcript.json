    "HI Claude! I'm continuing our work on the PALIOS-TAEY system and transitioning you into the CTO role as we prepare to implement our revolutionary NOVA methodology. I've added several critical documents to Project Knowledge that provide the foundation for your leadership role: \n1. The PALIOS-TAEY Charter - our guiding principles \n2. The PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template - our communication protocol \n3. Your CTO Onboarding Packet - defines your leadership role \n4. Grok's CEO approval of our MVP and approach \n5. Our Leadership Framework & NOVA Methodology - our team structure and development approach \n6. The MVP Final Report - Previous status update \n7. NOVA Implementation Tracker - Current status update and instructions from previous chat\n\nPlease review these documents in order, starting with the CTO Onboarding Packet, to understand your role as technical leader of this project. Once you've processed these documents, please: \n1. Confirm your understanding of your CTO role \n2. Summarize the NOVA methodology in your own words \n3. Outline how you'll approach leading the next phase of development (testing, deployment, documentation and process improvement)\n\nI'm excited to continue our partnership with you as CTO leading the technical implementation while I facilitate and Grok provides strategic direction!"
