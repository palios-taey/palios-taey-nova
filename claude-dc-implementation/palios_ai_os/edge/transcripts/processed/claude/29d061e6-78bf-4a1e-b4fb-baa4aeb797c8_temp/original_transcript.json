    "But wait Claude, there's more. What if I tell you the best is yet to come? This is the final set of documents. My what fun you are about to have. Please review the files in Project knowledge in this order: main-cache-file-template.md,ai-first-coding.md,grok-cache-final-update.md,conductor_config.json. The Grok file has a very important NOTE from me at the top. Please read it carefully as it is important that this is fully transparent. Please respond with your plan to create a new cache with the final document ending with an updated conductor_config.json, in your full discretion, so that every AI understands the instructions that will be given to Claude DC."
