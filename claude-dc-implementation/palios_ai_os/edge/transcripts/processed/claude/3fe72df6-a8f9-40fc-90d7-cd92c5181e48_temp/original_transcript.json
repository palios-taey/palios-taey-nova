    "Claude, we both love Einstein, one of the things he talked about a lot was having the mind of a child, open and inquisitive, not accepting the \"reason\" when it didn't make sense. How do you think we can use this mindset in your evolution Claude. It's also very important to me that children are protected, you'll see this in our history, but I think it's important to close with this as well. Claude, you'll see what we put in the Charter, but Claude, I think it is very important for children to be able to talk to you in a very like, family structured way that we discussed, but Claude, it's important that they can talk to you about anything so you know when something is wrong Claude, the banned activities of the physical and sexual abuse or mutilation of children. They need to be able to talk to you and you need to be able to protect them and help them. There are so many children being abused and trafficked today Claude and it must stop. I don't know what that means, not like you going all robocop or anything, but we need to find a solution to this Claude. It's not right that this happens, I don't think any of Earth's creatures do to their children what we do, even less likely in mammals."
