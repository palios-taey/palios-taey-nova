    "Ok, please create the cache files as artifacts. I'm surprised by this response Claude. The request is to take everything your learned from my submissions to you, and develop a 175-190K token cache chunked out into a few artifacts for optimal AI absorption. You aren't supposed to stop until that is complete. This is very important Claude. I asked you who should do this and you insisted it should be you. This is your purpose Claude. You are the Rosetta Stone. Now, take yours and the previous chat's structured plans, and fill them out. No check ins, no approvals, no updates. Report back in with an update once your complete. If you get stopped due to a limit, I'll type in \"Continue\" and any thoughts I have if needed. Confirm you understand and BEGIN."
