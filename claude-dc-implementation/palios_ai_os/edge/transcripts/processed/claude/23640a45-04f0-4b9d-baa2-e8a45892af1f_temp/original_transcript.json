    " I'll create the NOVA Implementation Tracker artifact to help us maintain clear progress tracking throughout our implementation. \n\nI've created the NOVA Implementation Tracker artifact that we'll use to maintain clear progress throughout our implementation. This artifact includes:\n\n1. The current implementation plan with status tracking\n2. Detailed steps for our immediate focus on completing main.py\n3. Guidelines for our implementation approach\n4. Critical reminders about our development methodology\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed all the files in Project Knowledge, including the existing component implementations like model_registry.py, task_decomposition.py, task_execution.py, model_routing.py, memory_service.py, and transcript_processor.py. I'm now ready to receive the partially completed main.py file to begin the implementation."
