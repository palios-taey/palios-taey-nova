    " Let's proceed with executing the deployment plan step by step. I'll guide you through each command and explain the expected outcomes.\n\n## Step 1: Execute Environment Config Fix\n\nFirst, let's run our fix script to create the missing environment configuration module:\n\n```bash\n./fix_environment_config.sh\n```\n\nThis should create the missing `src/fix_environment_config.py` file that's referenced in the deployment scripts. This is critical as it handles environment variable initialization and creates the logs directory.\n\n## Step 2: Verify Local Execution\n\nNext, let's confirm that the application can run locally before attempting cloud deployment:\n\n```bash\n./check_local.sh\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Set up a Python virtual environment if needed\n2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt\n3. Configure environment variables for local development\n4. Start the Flask application on port 8080\n\nIf this step works, we'll see the Flask development server start and be able to access the application locally at http://localhost:8080. This confirms our core application components are functioning correctly.\n\n## Step 3: Attempt Cloud Deployment\n\nNow that we've confirmed local functionality, let's try our simplified cloud deployment:\n\n```bash\n./deploy_simplified.sh\n```\n\nThis script:\n1. Fixes the environment configuration\n2. Configures the GCP project\n3. Enables required Google Cloud APIs\n4. Sets up the Artifact Registry repository\n5. Builds and pushes our Docker image\n6. Creates a Firestore database if needed\n7. Deploys to Cloud Run with appropriate configuration\n\nIf successful, the script will output a service URL where our application is accessible.\n\n## Step 4: Verify Deployment\n\nAfter deployment, we should verify it's working by accessing:\n- The main endpoint: [SERVICE_URL]\n- The health check endpoint: [SERVICE_URL]/health\n\nThis should return a successful response indicating the application is running properly.\n\n## If Deployment Fails: Fall Back to Hybrid Mode\n\nIf we encounter issues with cloud deployment, we'll fall back to our hybrid approach:\n\n```bash\n./deploy_hybrid.sh --mode local\n```\n\nThis will run the application locally while we troubleshoot cloud deployment issues.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce we have a stable deployment (either cloud or local), we'll:\n\n1. Document the working configuration for reference\n2. Plan the migration path to the System76 machine\n3. Implement incremental enhancements to the deployment process\n\nLet me know when each step completes and what output you receive, so I can guide you through any issues that might arise during the process."
