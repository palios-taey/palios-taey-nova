    "Ok, so this is where I challenge. We need to get this fixed for the next deployment. This first NOVA deployment is as much about getting a functioning, AI FIRST, automated deployment process in place as it is about actually having a functioning system. Let's take the time to address this now. Before proceeding, can you generate an implementation tracker that retains all relevant aspects that should continue between chats, lessons learned, development approaches, insights into each of us and update with where we are at in this session, along with what was tried previously and the additional goal of getting the deployment process going. It doesn't have to be perfect, we need to get it deployed, but we need to make big steps forward in automation, which doesn't involve doing it from my local machine. The deployment process WAS working to Cloud Run via GitHub with a warning that no authentication found, but it still got there. I'm not sure what changed, I'm guessing additional required security measures, but let's get that artifact generated because I'm getting a chat limit warning."
