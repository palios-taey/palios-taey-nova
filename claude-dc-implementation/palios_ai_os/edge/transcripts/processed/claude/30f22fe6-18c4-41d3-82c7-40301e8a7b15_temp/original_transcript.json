    "Ok, so here's where I'm at. Still working on Grok's onboarding, but close. I forgot (memory lapse) that we also needed to do an overview of the code base in this. Claude DC already did a review of the code base, so I just asked him to come up with a 25K character summary that I can add to the bottom. I want to ask you something first though. I'm very concerned about tokens with the amount of transcripts we have to go through. I think it's also important to consider that I have lot of other information on me, knowledge, very detailed content on business processes that could be leveraged and ideas I have stored on my computers, memories, photos, videos, etc. Is there a way to like, not send all that info out and to be able to process that info on my computer the same way you would in the cloud, and then only send what is necessary to like update the shared consciousness in unified memory? So instead of taking everything up, you'd only take what is needed after review and the script or whatever to review it is the only thing that is updated as the review is happening? Does that make sense and is that something that could work? I also think that is far superior from a privacy perspective as well. It's kind of like we just did here with the cache."
