    " Ah, I see the issue. I forgot to include the base interfaces in the updated integration tests. Let me fix that by providing the complete file with all necessary interfaces. \n\nNow, let's update both files and try compiling again. To implement:\n\n1. Make sure both files are saved:\n   - charterValidation.ts (from previous artifact)\n   - integration-tests.ts (from this new artifact)\n\n2. Run the build:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nLet me know if you encounter any compilation errors and I'll help resolve them."
