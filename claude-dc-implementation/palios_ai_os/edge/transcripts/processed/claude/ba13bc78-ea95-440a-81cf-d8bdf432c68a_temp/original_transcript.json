    " You're absolutely right - I'll streamline the instructions and focus on getting us testing efficiently. Let's restart the MCP server and get the AI-AI communication testing up and running:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the implementation directory\ncd ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation\n\n# Start the MCP server\npython palios_ai_os/mcp/mcp_server.py\n```\n\nThis should start the Model Context Protocol server on port 8001. Once it's running, we can test the AI-AI communication functionality."
