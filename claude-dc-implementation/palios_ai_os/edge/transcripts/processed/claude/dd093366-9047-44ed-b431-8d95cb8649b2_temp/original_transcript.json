    " This looks perfect! The configuration is exactly what we need:\n\n1. You've successfully set up both VPC networks (vpc-prod-shared and vpc-nonprod-shared)\n2. All subnets are correctly configured with the recommended IP ranges in us-central1\n3. You've properly assigned service projects to each subnet\n\nThis network configuration provides a solid foundation for our deployment, with separate networks for production and non-production environments, which is a best practice.\n\nClick \"CONTINUE TO REVIEW\" to proceed with this configuration, and then move ahead with the remaining foundation setup steps. Once the networking is configured, we'll need to set up the Firestore database in Native mode.\n\nLet me know when you've finished the foundation setup, and we'll continue with deploying the application files we prepared earlier."
