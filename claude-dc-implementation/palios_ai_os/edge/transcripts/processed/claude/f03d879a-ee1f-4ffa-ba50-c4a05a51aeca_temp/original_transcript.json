    "It seems like there needs to be a lot of back and forth between me and Claude DC with getting things on my actual machine outside of his virtual environment. I fully understand that is a hard constraint, that Claude DC can't access my physical machine, but I really don't want to be in the loop for just like moving stuff if it all possible.
