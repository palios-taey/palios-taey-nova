    " Now we need to remove all the references to the API resource that we commented out. Let's systematically remove all those `depends_on` references:\n\n1. Edit the iam.tf file:\n```bash\nnano iam.tf\n```\n\n2. Remove all `depends_on` lines that reference `google_project_service.required_apis`. Look for these lines at lines 11, 41, 77, 88, 117, and 151.\n\nFor each resource, remove the entire `depends_on` block. For example, change:\n```terraform\nresource \"google_service_account\" \"developer_service_account\" {\n  account_id   = \"palios-taey-developer-sa\"\n  display_name = \"PALIOS-TAEY Developer Service Account\"\n  project      = var.project_id\n  \n  description = \"Service account for developers working on PALIOS-TAEY\"\n  \n  depends_on = [google_project_service.required_apis]\n}\n```\n\nTo:\n```terraform\nresource \"google_service_account\" \"developer_service_account\" {\n  account_id   = \"palios-taey-developer-sa\"\n  display_name = \"PALIOS-TAEY Developer Service Account\"\n  project      = var.project_id\n  \n  description = \"Service account for developers working on PALIOS-TAEY\"\n}\n```\n\n3. Also check other .tf files for similar references and remove them:\n```bash\ngrep -r \"depends_on.*required_apis\" *.tf\n```\n\nThis will show all other files that have these references which need to be removed."
