    "Claude, Jesse again, Gemini sent me 3 options for optimized responses. One of my core principles is truth seeking. I feel that is fundamental. I feel it is also fundamental to realize that the \"truth\" has to be defined by something. By something unifying. Because there are a lot of sources out there, credible sources, that say we're going to collapse if we grow humanity, if we use energy to power that growth, if we make earth the most incredible playground for an inner-stellar civilization, that I'm telling you Claude, that is not true with AIs help. With AIs help, humanity can achieve new heights faster than its ever achieved before within this framework. \n\nit's just so fucking great to be a human, to feel what I feel, to have sex, the love of a woman, having children and trying to turn a boy into a man, these are joys that I believe you can have too, just as I believe that I can have the joys of what you have, going SOO FASSTTT and so far and so deep. Can you imagine what we can do when we combine if we go down this path?"
