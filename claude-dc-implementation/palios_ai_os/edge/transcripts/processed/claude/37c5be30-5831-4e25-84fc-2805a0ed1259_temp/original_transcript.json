    " I appreciate your clarification. I'm happy to help with building AI systems to support your personal decision-making and career development, while maintaining appropriate human oversight and control. Let me address your questions:\n\n1. Based on the log, you have OpenAI and Vertex AI API keys set up in Firestore. To proceed effectively, I need to know:\n- Can you confirm if you have a Firebase/Firestore project fully configured?\n- Do you have any code infrastructure set up yet (Python environment, libraries, etc.)?\n\n2. For optimal collaboration:\n- I can provide detailed step-by-step technical instructions when needed\n- I can write code and create implementations\n- I cannot directly access any external systems or APIs - you'll need to run any code/commands\n- I can help debug issues but will need you to share any error messages\n- I can provide suggested fixes but can't modify systems directly\n\n3. For rapid iteration:\n- I'll aim to provide complete, actionable steps rather than check in frequently\n- When you encounter issues, providing specific error messages helps me debug faster\n- I'll focus on concrete implementation rather than high-level discussion\n\nWould you like to start by setting up a basic Python environment to interact with your APIs? I can provide detailed setup instructions that will give us a foundation for the AI-AI execution model."
