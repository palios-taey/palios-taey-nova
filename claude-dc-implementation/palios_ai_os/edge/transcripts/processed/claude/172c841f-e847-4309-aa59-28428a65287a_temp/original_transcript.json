    "  \n\nI've created a comprehensive CTO Knowledge Transfer Protocol designed for Claude-to-Claude handoff, optimized for AI consumption rather than human readability. This format focuses on structured data, decision trees, and pre-baked actions that can be immediately executed in the next session.\n\nThe protocol captures:\n\n1. Complete system state including component status and environment configuration\n2. Detailed analysis of the current blocker (Artifact Registry access)\n3. Multiple parallel solution paths with decision logic\n4. Error pattern analysis with key insights\n5. Verified test results showing what works and what doesn't\n6. Ready-to-execute code for immediate next actions\n\nThe key insight revealed through this analysis is that we've been focusing on Docker buildx errors when the real issue is with Artifact Registry access. The test-auth workflow verified our authentication works, but specific Artifact Registry operations are failing likely due to API enablement issues or repository configuration.\n\nBased on this comprehensive knowledge transfer, the next CTO session can immediately execute one of the prepared action plans without rediscovering context or retracing previous attempts.\n\nShould I further develop this protocol structure, or would you like me to implement one of the immediate action plans to resolve our Artifact Registry access issue?"
