    " Here's the command for Claude DC to load the cache update file from the `/jesse` directory:\n\n```bash\ncache load -f ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/current-execution-status/jesse/cache-update.md\n```\n\nThis will append the content of the cache-update.md file to Claude DC's existing cache. After running this command, Claude DC should be able to access the AI-AI Communication Framework information we've added.\n\nIf you need to check if the file exists in that location first, you can run:\n\n```bash\nls -la ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/current-execution-status/jesse/cache-update.md\n```"
