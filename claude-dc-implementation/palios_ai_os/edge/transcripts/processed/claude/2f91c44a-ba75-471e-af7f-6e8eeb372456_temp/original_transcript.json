    " Great news! The service is now successfully deployed and responding correctly to both the root endpoint and the health check endpoint. This confirms that our deployment pipeline is working and the application is running properly in Cloud Run.\n\nFor what we have now, this deployment is complete and working as expected. The current implementation is a minimal viable service that provides health checks, which is perfect for establishing our deployment pipeline.\n\nIf you'd like to implement the full functionality from the MVP final report (Unified Memory System, Dynamic Model Registry, Task Decomposition Engine, etc.), we can incrementally add each component to this foundation. However, according to the NOVA methodology we've established, each major functionality should be implemented with a clean-slate approach.\n\nFor now, I recommend we celebrate this successful deployment as a milestone. We've:\n\n1. Set up a GitHub repository\n2. Established a continuous deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions\n3. Deployed a working application to Google Cloud Run\n4. Fixed multiple challenging issues through systematic troubleshooting\n\nDo you want to proceed with implementing the complete system components, or would you prefer to review the architecture first before moving forward with additional development?"
