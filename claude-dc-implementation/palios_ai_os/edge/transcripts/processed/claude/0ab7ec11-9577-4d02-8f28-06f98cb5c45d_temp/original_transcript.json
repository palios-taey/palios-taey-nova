    " Excellent! The health endpoint is now working correctly. This is a great first step. Let's run a few more tests to verify other aspects of the deployment:\n\n1. Let's check if the web interface is accessible:\n```bash\n# Open the main URL in a browser or use curl to verify HTML is returned\ncurl https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/\n```\n\n2. Let's also test that the service is stable by hitting the health endpoint multiple times:\n```bash\n# Run multiple requests to check stability\nfor i in {1..5}; do \n  curl https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/health\n  echo \"\"\n  sleep 1\ndone\n```\n\nNow that we have a stable foundation, we can incrementally add back the other features:\n\n1. Re-integrate the memory system functionality\n2. Add back the model integration\n3. Restore the API endpoints with proper authentication\n\nBut first, let's create a proper amendment for my future self to document what we learned:\n\n**CTO Amendment: Deployment Error Patterns and Mitigation**\n\nThe key lessons from this deployment experience:\n1. Start with the absolute minimal viable application before adding complexity\n2. Verify missing dependencies and files before deployment \n3. Test templates and JavaScript for syntax errors\n4. Use clear error logging to identify root causes\n5. Deploy incrementally, adding features one at a time\n\nThis pattern should be standard for all future deployments - start simple, verify it works, then build complexity gradually while testing at each step.\n\nWould you like me to prepare the next steps for re-integrating the full functionality now that we have a working base?"
