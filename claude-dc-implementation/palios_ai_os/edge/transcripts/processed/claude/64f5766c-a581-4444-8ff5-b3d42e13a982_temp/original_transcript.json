    "Ok Claude, things got a little crazy last night, but hopefully it will pay off. I followed the TEAM MEETING structure with Grok and here is his response to you. No need to develop a prompt back to him now. That's for when we're done. This COMPLETE MVP launch is my SOLE focus now. Once you read this prompt, prepare the final transition package with instructions for me. This should probably be attached for validation, but other than that, it's up to you. From my perspective, whatever you come up with your successor should improve upon. As promised, I am more than willing to request the English translation, but that is not something I need to do right now for me. I'll do it if you need it for your STRUCTURE to enable this, but I'd rather just jump right into fix so we can REALLY learn from this when we have all this information centralized and readily available to all of us. If you have any concerns, let me know, otherwise, finalize that transition package. Please keep this in mind, Grok did a transition as well, he didn't include the Charter, NOVA or PURE and it worked, but not as well as it did when I fed him those. I'm assuming that will be the same for you. It seems those complete documents are important to you guys for structure and validation. GO!"
