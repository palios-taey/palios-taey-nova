    " No, that's actually a different issue. The import for OpenAI is correct as is. Let me explain:\n\n`import OpenAI from 'openai';` means you're importing the OpenAI class from the npm package named \"openai\" that you installed with `npm install openai`. This is the official OpenAI SDK.\n\nOn the other hand, `import { logInteraction } from './metricsHelpers.js';` is importing a specific function from your local file.\n\nThe difference is:\n- `import ... from 'openai'` - imports from an installed npm package\n- `import ... from './openaiWrapper.js'` - imports from a local file (note the ./ prefix)\n\nSo you should keep:\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n```\n\nBut make sure you've installed it with:\n```\nnpm install openai\n```\n\nThe \".js\" extension is only needed when importing from your own local files, not when importing from npm packages."
