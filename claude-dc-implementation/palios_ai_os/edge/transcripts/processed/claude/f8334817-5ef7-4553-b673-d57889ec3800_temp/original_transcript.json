    " I see the issue now! You have two functions both named `health_check` - one at line 647 and another at line 516. Let me provide a clean fix: \n\n\n\nI've fixed the main issue in `main.py`. The problem was that you had two functions both using the route `/health`:\n\n1. One function named `health_check` at line 516\n2. Another function also named `health_check` at line 647 (where you pasted my updated code)\n\nThis caused a Flask routing conflict because:\n1. Flask can't have two different functions with the same route\n2. You can't have two functions with the same name in Python\n\nMy fix:\n\n1. Renamed the first health check function to `api_health_check` (which keeps its route as `/api/health`)\n2. Renamed the second health check function to `health_check_detailed` (which keeps its route as `/health`)\n3. Ensured each route has a unique handler function name\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n1. Replace your current `main.py` file with the fixed version I provided:\n   ```bash\n   cp fixed-main-py.py src/main.py\n   ```\n\n2. Commit and push the changes:\n   ```bash\n   git add src/main.py\n   git commit -m \"Fix routing conflicts in main.py by renaming duplicate functions\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\nThis fix follows the NOVA methodology principle of making targeted, precise changes focused on the specific issue rather than rewriting large sections unnecessarily. The key insight was to ensure that each route has a unique handler function name.\n\nLet me know when the changes are pushed, and we'll monitor the deployment to ensure it resolves the issue."
