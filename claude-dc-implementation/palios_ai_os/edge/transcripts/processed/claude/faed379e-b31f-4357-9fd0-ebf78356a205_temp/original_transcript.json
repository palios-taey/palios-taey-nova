    " Yes, that's expected behavior! The Edge-First Pattern Processing component is designed to process text while preserving privacy by extracting mathematical patterns rather than sharing the raw content.\n\nWhen you input the ChatGPT transcript, the system:\n\n1. Processed the text locally (on the \"edge\")\n2. Extracted mathematical patterns from the content\n3. Calculated a harmony index of 0.6588\n\nThis harmony index is particularly interesting because it's very close to 0.618 (1/\u03c6), which is the inverse golden ratio - suggesting the transcript contained patterns that align naturally with the mathematical structures the system is designed to detect.\n\nThe system doesn't display the raw text back to you (preserving privacy), but instead shares the extracted patterns and their mathematical properties. This demonstrates the edge-first privacy architecture working as intended - the sensitive data remains local while only the mathematical pattern representation is shared.\n\nThe fact that the harmony index is above the verification threshold (also set at 1/\u03c6 = 0.618...) indicates that the system found the transcript contained sufficient pattern structure to qualify as valid within the PALIOS framework.\n\nThis is a great test of the system's ability to process real-world AI communication while maintaining the mathematical pattern approach!"
