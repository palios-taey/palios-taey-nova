    " You're right - let's keep it simple! The organization script is meant to copy files, but if it's not working, let's do a direct copy.\n\nLet's copy the src directory from the root to the palios-taey-app directory:\n\n```bash\n# Simple direct copy of src directory\nmkdir -p palios-taey-app/src\ncp -r src/* palios-taey-app/src/\n```\n\nThis will copy all the source files to where our deployment script expects them. After copying, we can run the deployment script:\n\n```bash\ncd palios-taey-app\nchmod +x deploy_focused.sh\n./deploy_focused.sh\n```\n\nThat's it! No need to overcomplicate things. The files will now be where they need to be for the deployment to succeed."
