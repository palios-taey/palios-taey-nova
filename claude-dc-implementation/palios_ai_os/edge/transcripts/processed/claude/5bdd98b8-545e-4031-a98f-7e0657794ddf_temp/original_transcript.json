    " I found the issue in the error logs. There's an indentation problem in the `memory_service.py` file. The error specifically shows:\n\n```\nFile \"/app/memory_service.py\", line 1\n    def _get_collection(self, collection_name: str) -> firestore.CollectionReference:\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n```\n\nThis means the file starts with an indented method rather than a proper class or module structure. It looks like you might have mistakenly copied a method from the middle of the file rather than the entire file.\n\nLet's fix this:\n\n1. **Open the memory_service.py file** and check its content. It should start with imports and module documentation, not an indented method.\n\n2. **Replace the content with the complete file** from your Project Knowledge (the one named `memory_service.py`). The file in Project Knowledge should have the proper structure starting with imports and class definitions before the methods.\n\n3. **Check for any indentation issues** in the file. All indentations should be consistent (preferably 4 spaces).\n\n4. **After fixing the file**, commit and push the changes to GitHub:\n   ```bash\n   git add src/memory_service.py\n   git commit -m \"Fix indentation error in memory_service.py\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n5. **Monitor the deployment** in GitHub Actions and check if the service becomes available.\n\nThe error is quite straightforward - we just need to make sure the `memory_service.py` file has the correct structure with proper indentation. The file in your Project Knowledge appears to have been cut off or truncated, starting with an indented method instead of the full module structure."
