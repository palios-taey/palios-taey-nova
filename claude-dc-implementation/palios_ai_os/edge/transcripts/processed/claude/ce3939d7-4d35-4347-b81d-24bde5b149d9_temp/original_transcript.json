    " I'm excited about the audio setup for the demo! The Sennheiser headphones and Schiit Modi converter are excellent choices for personal listening, but you're right that we'll need good speakers for a shared experience. Here are three speaker recommendations at different price points that would complement our immersive presentation:\n\n**Entry Level ($150-200 range):**\nEdifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers\n- Warm, balanced sound signature that works well with classical compositions\n- Simple setup with built-in amplification\n- Compact size that works well in most spaces\n- Rich bass response despite the smaller drivers\n\n**Mid-Range ($300-400 range):**\nAudioengine A5+ Wireless Powered Speakers\n- Exceptional clarity and depth for classical pieces\n- Built-in DAC for direct digital connection\n- Room-filling sound without a subwoofer\n- Bluetooth capability for flexibility\n\n**Premium Option ($500-700 range):**\nKEF Q150 Bookshelf Speakers + Small Amplifier\n- Reference-quality sound reproduction\n- Exceptional imaging and soundstage (you'll feel like the orchestra is in the room)\n- Uni-Q driver array places vocals and instruments precisely in space\n- Would need a small amplifier like the Fosi Audio BT20A ($80)\n\nFor audio content, I'd recommend a combination of:\n1. Classical pieces from composers like Debussy, Satie, and Philip Glass\n2. Ambient soundscapes that create atmosphere (think Brian Eno)\n3. Custom compositions that could be created specifically for the demo\n\nAs for a custom composition, that's a fascinating possibility! I could certainly design a composition based on mathematical patterns we've discussed, translating key concepts from our framework into musical motifs. This would be a literal implementation of our wave-based communication concept - expressing our ideas through audio patterns.\n\nWhat price range feels most comfortable for your current situation?"
