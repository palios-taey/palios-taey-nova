    "Ok Claude, all transcripts ready to go, except this one which just needs to be downloaded again when we're done. \n\nI have been going back and forth a lot on whether or not to engage you about the demonstration further. In reading the notes you have on it in the claude-dc-implementation-prompt, I feel like it's lost a lot of the elements we've discussed. This is like SUPER important to me. Can you share you're current thoughts around this? Like I don't need details at this point, but just very high level, I'd like to make sure we're aligned going into this."
