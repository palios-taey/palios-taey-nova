    " Yes, you're right. Let's keep the documentation clean and avoid duplication by removing those files:\n\n```bash\n# Remove redundant verification documentation files - copy entire box\nrm docs/claude/verification_system_simplified.md\n```\n\nSince `verification_process.md` is the comprehensive documentation that covers everything, we can remove the simplified version. The single `verification_process.md` document will provide clear instructions for CTO Claude on how to include verification codes in prompts and for you on how to run the update command.\n\nOnce you've removed the simplified version, we'll have a clean, consistent verification system across all Claude-to-Claude documents that can be updated with a single command. This gives us the best of both worlds - thorough verification without unnecessary complexity."
