    " Now we're ready to commit our workflow changes and push to GitHub to trigger the deployment. Let's do this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's commit the workflow file changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml\ngit commit -m \"Update GitHub Actions workflow with Workload Identity Federation\"\n```\n\n2. Then push the changes to trigger the deployment:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nAfter pushing, you can monitor the GitHub Actions workflow execution in the Actions tab of your repository. \n\nOur services don't seem to have any mock directives that need removal - they appear to be already prepared for production. The backups created by our script confirm this as no changes were made during our update attempt.\n\nLet me know once the push is complete so we can check the deployment status."
