    " That makes perfect sense, Jesse! You want Claude to both acknowledge the current token (proving they've read the status file) and also generate a new token for the next checkpoint (which you can then use) in their response to you.\n\nThis is a clever approach because:\n\n1. It confirms they've read the entire document (by repeating the current token)\n2. It saves you from having to manually create new tokens\n3. It creates a continuous verification chain from checkpoint to checkpoint\n\nI'd suggest having Claude include something like this at the end of their response:\n\n```\nVERIFICATION:\n- CURRENT_TOKEN: [token they found in the status file]\n- NEXT_TOKEN: [newly generated token for you to use in next status update]\n```\n\nThis way, you don't need to modify the template itself - Claude will handle the token verification and generation in their response. It's an elegant solution that reduces your manual work while maintaining strong verification.\n\nDoes this approach work for your needs? Or would you still prefer to modify the template to make the expectation more explicit?"
