    " I see the issue now - it's a problem with the Workload Identity Provider configuration. The error shows that there's a mismatch in the expected audience for the token. This is a common issue with Workload Identity Federation.\n\nLet's fix this by adjusting our approach. We have two options:\n\n1. Fix the Workload Identity Federation configuration in GCP\n2. Use a service account key for authentication temporarily\n\nSince we want to move forward quickly, let's use option 2 and we can revisit the Workload Identity Federation later. \n\nI see the issue with the Workload Identity Federation. Let's create a service account key for temporary use instead, since that's a more reliable approach while we troubleshoot the Workload Identity setup.\n\nHere's our plan:\n\n1. Create a service account key for the github-actions-sa service account\n2. Update our GitHub workflow to use the key-based authentication\n3. Store the key as a GitHub repository secret\n\n### Step 1: Generate a service account key\n\nRun these commands to create a service account key:\n\n```bash\n# Create a directory for the key if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p credentials\n\n# Generate the key (make sure you're logged in to gcloud)\ngcloud iam service-accounts keys create credentials/github-actions-key.json \\\n  --iam-account=github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add the key as a GitHub secret\n\n1. Open your GitHub repository in the browser\n2. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions\n3. Click \"New repository secret\"\n4. Name: `GCP_SA_KEY`\n5. Value: [Copy the entire contents of the credentials/github-actions-key.json file]\n6. Click \"Add secret\"\n\n### Step 3: Update your workflow file\n\nReplace the content of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the updated workflow I provided, then commit and push:\n\n```bash\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml\ngit commit -m \"Switch to service account key authentication\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis approach will bypass the Workload Identity Federation issues for now, and we can revisit the federation setup later."
