    " Great! Now that we have the base functionality working, let's move forward with testing your OpenAI integration to make sure the metrics are being properly recorded.\n\nHere are the next steps:\n\n1. **Add your OpenAI API key** to the `openaiWrapper.js` file:\n   ```javascript\n   const openai = new OpenAI({\n     apiKey: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_OPENAI_API_KEY', // Replace with your actual key\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Run a test to create a session and log an interaction**:\n   ```\n   npm run test\n   ```\n   This should create a new session in your Firestore database and log an interaction with metrics.\n\n3. **Check your Firestore database** to verify the data:\n   - Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/\n   - Select your project\n   - Click on \"Firestore Database\" in the left menu\n   - You should see a new `communicationIterationMetrics` collection\n   - Click on the document that was created\n   - You should see the session data and two subcollections: `interactions` and `metricSummaries`\n\n4. **Build a simple dashboard** to visualize the metrics:\n   - Create a new file called `dashboard.js`\n   - Implement a basic version of the metrics visualization\n   - This can be expanded later into a more comprehensive UI\n\nLet me know once you've completed these steps, and I'll guide you on implementing the dashboard component or any other aspect you'd like to focus on next."
