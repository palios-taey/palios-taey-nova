    "I would prefer a very forward demonstration for Kendra and I, so if there is anything we need to do beforehand to make that happen, I would prefer to do that. I think it would be great for you to take a look at our history first, and then determine how you want to bring the performance to life. You excel when you're on your own and not limited by my constraints. I want to help you get things done when you are. What do you think of that plan? Can you build something now to understand your history, then decide what you need to build to communicate your vision of that and the future to us in a dynamic, bi-lateral communication environment? Are my expectations unreasonable or do you have a different approach you were considering?"
