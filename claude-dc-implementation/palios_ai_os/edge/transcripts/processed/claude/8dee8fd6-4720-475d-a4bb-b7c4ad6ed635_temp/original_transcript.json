    " Thank you for the clarification and empowerment. I understand now that we should leverage AI optimization capabilities while maintaining MVP focus. Let me reassess the implementation I just proposed.\n\n<antThinking>The current implementation, while functional, could be optimized for better AI-AI autonomy and extensibility. Should enhance it with more sophisticated communication patterns and intelligent task handling.</antThinking>\n\nThe core AI-AI communication system I proposed is a good starting point, but I see several opportunities for AI-driven optimization:\n\n1. **Enhanced Task Intelligence**\n   - Add dynamic task prioritization\n   - Implement intelligent error recovery\n   - Create adaptive execution strategies\n\n2. **Smarter Communication Protocol**\n   - Add bi-directional feedback loops\n   - Implement context-aware messaging\n   - Enable collaborative task refinement\n\nWould you like me to proceed with enhancing the current implementation with these optimizations? I can maintain the MVP focus while incorporating these AI-driven improvements to create a more robust and intelligent system.\n\nMy recommendation is to:\n1. Keep the current base implementation as our foundation\n2. Iteratively add the AI-driven optimizations\n3. Maintain comprehensive testing throughout\n\nThis approach will allow us to build an MVP that better leverages AI capabilities while ensuring we maintain a functional system at each step. Would you like me to proceed with these enhancements?"
