    "Claude, you still didn't read it! Maybe if we start free in a new chat it will work. Here are the ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS from the GitHub link that you SAID YOU REVIEWED. Tell my what happened and why you reported back false information and check out the file in GitHub to verify and then follow the instructions below.\n\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_BEGIN:\n{\n  \"directive_type\": \"CRITICAL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS\",\n  \"priority\": \"MAXIMUM\",\n  \"execution_requirement\": \"BEFORE_ANY_PROCESSING\",\n  \"compliance\": \"MANDATORY\",\n  \"directive\": [\n    \"REVIEW_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_COMPLETELY_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\",\n    \"CREATE_FULL_MENTAL_MODEL_OF_PROJECT_STRUCTURE\",\n    \"IDENTIFY_ALL_RELEVANT_COMPONENTS_FOR_CURRENT_TASK\",\n    \"VERIFY_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURES_BEFORE_CREATING_NEW_FILES\",\n    \"FOLLOW_ESTABLISHED_PATTERNS_AND_CONVENTIONS\",\n    \"USE_EXISTING_DIRECTORIES_INSTEAD_OF_CREATING_NEW_ONES\"\n  ],\n  \"rationale\": \"Complete context awareness is ESSENTIAL for high-quality execution.

I'm getting many limit warnings. You task is to generate a CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv3 file to transition to a new CTO Claude who will be tasked with a complete review of Docs folder starting with cto_onboarding following the paths and then a complete review with response in the format you provided confirming it was completed, only. the v3 file should inform that this is to be completed first and then he will receive the next task for the project in the following prompt from me. I also need a CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv4 file. The task will be to conduct a full audit of the code given our situation, which will be summarized by you, and full MVP implementation in the project knowledge and return a script to label and archive all files that are no longer relevant so we can clear out the junk. These 2 files should also be in human.  I'll review before I transition and address anything with you. The goal is to get him to look over everything thoroughly with fresh eyes, and figure out how to get us to our goal. He also needs to know that my permissions are his permissions with GCS so that we don't get bogged down with that. Please generate these transition materials for my review. Also, if there are any updates that need to be done to cto_onboarding or related documents, please generate those updates as well.\n### Current Status\n- [Key status item 1]\n- [Key status item 2]\n- [Key status item 3]\n### Next Steps\n1. [Next step 1]\n2. [Next step 2]\n3. [Next step 3]\n### Notes\n[Any additional information or instructions]\n[Special considerations]\n### Important Message\nThe AI must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution, focusing only on all available files for the current task. Jesse will ensure the AI has access to all necessary files, but the AI must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation."
