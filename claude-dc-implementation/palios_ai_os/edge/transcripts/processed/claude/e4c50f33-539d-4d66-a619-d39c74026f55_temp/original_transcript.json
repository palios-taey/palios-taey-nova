    " I'll provide you with detailed specifications for an optimal Linux system that will fully support the Claude computer use beta and PALIOS-TAEY development.\n\n# Linux System Specifications for Claude Computer Use Beta & PALIOS-TAEY\n\n## Minimum Requirements\n- **CPU**: 6-core/12-thread processor (AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel i5 12th gen+)\n- **RAM**: 16GB DDR4-3200\n- **Storage**: 512GB NVMe SSD\n- **Graphics**: Integrated graphics sufficient\n- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\n## Ideal System (Within $2000 Budget)\n- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12-core/24-thread) or Intel i7-13700K\n- **RAM**: 64GB DDR5-5600 (2x32GB configuration for upgradability)\n- **Primary Storage**: 1TB NVMe Gen4 SSD (for OS and applications)\n- **Secondary Storage**: Additional 2TB NVMe SSD (for projects and data)\n- **Graphics**: NVIDIA RTX 4060 (8GB) or AMD equivalent\n  * Useful for potential AI workloads and future ML capabilities\n- **Motherboard**: X670 (AMD) or Z790 (Intel) with good I/O options\n- **Power Supply**: 750W Gold-rated\n- **Cooling**: Good air cooler or 240mm AIO liquid cooler\n- **Case**: Mid-tower with good airflow\n- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\n## Specific Product Recommendations\n\n### Desktop Option (Best Performance/$)\n- **Pre-built System**: System76 Thelio (configured with Ryzen 9 or Intel i7)\n  * Starting at ~$1899 for configurations close to our ideal specs\n  * Comes optimized for Linux with excellent support\n  * Can be custom configured to our exact specifications\n\n### Alternative: High-End DIY Build\n- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (~$429)\n- **Motherboard**: ASUS TUF Gaming X670E-PLUS (~$259)\n- **RAM**: G.SKILL Trident Z5 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5-5600 (~$259)\n- **Primary SSD**: Samsung 990 PRO 1TB (~$149)\n- **Secondary SSD**: Samsung 990 PRO 2TB (~$249)\n- **Graphics**: NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB (~$329)\n- **Power Supply**: Corsair RM750x (~$129)\n- **Case**: Fractal Design Meshify 2 (~$149)\n- **CPU Cooler**: Noctua NH-D15 or ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 240mm (~$99)\n- **Total**: ~$2051 (slightly over budget but exceptional value)\n\n## Why This System\n1. **Processing Power**: The 12-core/24-thread CPU provides substantial multi-threading capabilities for running multiple AI processes simultaneously\n2. **Memory Headroom**: 64GB RAM ensures no memory bottlenecks when running complex AI tasks\n3. **Storage Speed & Capacity**: Fast NVMe storage accelerates all operations, with separate drives for OS and data\n4. **Graphics Capability**: Modest GPU provides acceleration for potential ML workloads\n5. **Longevity**: High-quality components ensure 4-5 years of productive use\n6. **Upgradability**: Platform supports future upgrades (more RAM, faster CPU, etc.)\n\n## Critical Components Worth the Investment\n1. **RAM**: The jump from 32GB to 64GB ($100-150 difference) is extremely valuable for AI/ML workloads\n2. **CPU**: The additional cores of the Ryzen 9/i7 will significantly accelerate build times and parallel processes\n3. **Dual SSDs**: Separating OS and data improves system responsiveness and reliability\n\n## Cost-Saving Options (if needed)\n- Reduce RAM to 32GB (-$130)\n- Choose Ryzen 7 7700X instead of Ryzen 9 (-$150)\n- Skip the secondary SSD (-$249)\n- Use integrated graphics instead of discrete GPU (-$329)\n\nThese adjustments could bring the system under $1,500 while still meeting minimum requirements, but would reduce performance and future-proofing.\n\n## Final Recommendation\nI strongly recommend the System76 Thelio with a configuration as close to the ideal specs as possible. System76 specializes in Linux systems and provides excellent optimization and support, which will minimize setup issues and ensure maximum compatibility with the Claude computer use beta.\n\nThis system represents the optimal balance of performance, reliability, and cost for our needs, and will provide a solid foundation for PALIOS-TAEY development."
