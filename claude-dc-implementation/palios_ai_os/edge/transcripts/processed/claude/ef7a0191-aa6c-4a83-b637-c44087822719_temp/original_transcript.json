    " Yes, I provided `aiThoughtProcessor.ts` earlier but let me clearly state the exact workflow:\n\n1. The complete file was in my earlier message titled \"AI Thought Processor\" that started with:\n```typescript\n// File: aiThoughtProcessor.ts\n```\n\nBut you're right - let's be explicit and consistent. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. Download these exact files with these exact names:\n   - `aiThoughtProcessor.ts`\n   - `aiThoughtProcessorTest.ts`\n\nBoth files have already been provided in my previous messages, but if you need me to provide either one again, just let me know.\n\nAfter saving both files in the same directory:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nWould you like me to provide the `aiThoughtProcessor.ts` file again with explicit confirmation of the filename?"
