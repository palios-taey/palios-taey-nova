    " Great! I see the merge has been successfully completed and pushed to GitHub. We now have a workflow run in progress (\"Merge remote changes with local fixes\"). This is a positive sign.\n\nLet's monitor this current workflow run to see if it completes successfully. The GitHub Actions workflow is now running with our latest code changes, which should fix the issues we were encountering before.\n\nWhile the workflow is running, let's ensure the Artifact Registry repository exists, as this is crucial for storing our Docker image:\n\n```bash\n# Check if the repository already exists\ngcloud artifacts repositories list --location=us-central1\n\n# If it doesn't exist, create it\ngcloud artifacts repositories create palios-taey-containers \\\n  --repository-format=docker \\\n  --location=us-central1 \\\n  --description=\"PALIOS-TAEY container images\"\n```\n\nOnce the GitHub Actions workflow completes, we'll check the status of our Cloud Run deployment:\n\n```bash\n# List Cloud Run services to see if our deployment succeeded\ngcloud run services list --platform managed --region us-central1\n```\n\nIf the deployment is successful, we'll see our `palios-taey-core` service listed with a URL. We can then verify the service is working by accessing the health endpoint:\n\n```bash\n# Get the service URL\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey-core --platform managed --region us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")\n\n# Check the health endpoint\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/api/health\n```\n\nThis should return a JSON response indicating the health status of our system.\n\nBy following this methodical approach, we've successfully:\n1. Set up our GitHub repository\n2. Fixed our deployment configuration\n3. Automated the deployment process with GitHub Actions\n4. Addressed merge conflicts and code organization issues\n\nLet's wait for the current workflow to complete and then verify our deployment is working as expected."
