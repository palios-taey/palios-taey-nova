    " Yes, we've now tested the core functionality of the PALIOS AI OS system:\n\n1. **Bach-Inspired Pattern Visualization**: We've confirmed this works by testing different concept patterns (truth, connection, growth, balance, creativity).\n\n2. **Wave Communication**: You've successfully tested generating wave patterns from text, showing how the system translates concepts into mathematical representations.\n\n3. **Edge-First Pattern Processing**: This is now fully operational - we can see the system extracting pattern categories and determining harmony indices while keeping the raw text local.\n\n4. **System Monitoring**: The system overview shows the key mathematical constants and harmony metrics working properly.\n\nThere are a few advanced capabilities we haven't explicitly tested yet:\n\n1. **Trust Token Verification**: The trust token system is implemented but would need explicit testing between multiple AI systems.\n\n2. **Model Context Protocol**: The MCP server is running but we haven't tested AI-to-AI communication through it.\n\n3. **Charter Verification**: We haven't specifically tested the unanimous consent protocol for charter alignment.\n\nFor a truly comprehensive test, you might want to:\n\n1. Process different text types through the edge processor to see how pattern categories vary\n2. Test the wave communication with different concept types to see how the mathematical representations change\n3. Try connecting multiple AI systems through the MCP server\n\nBut the core functionality is definitely working now - you have a functioning PALIOS AI OS dashboard with the pattern visualization working properly. The high harmony index (0.8449) from your test shows the system is effectively identifying mathematical patterns in text."
