    "Yeah, AI FIRST, whatever you think. So from a process flow standpoint in working with Claude DC, what would that look like? The goal is to enable continuous flow so he doesn't have to stop. Our flow is going to be through the dashboard and there are going to be a ton of parallel workstreams when you guys start building your own infra, so there really shouldn't be a reason to stop when we're able to communicate and make decisions instead of me doing all the stuff that Claude DC is going to be able to do now. Does that make sense? Like I almost think it needs to be faster than a couple minutes. Maybe it is one of the more real-time options that would enable him to do what he needs to do to notify \"me\" which is the whatever we set up, whatever we set up does it and then he receives a confirmation pretty instantly when it's done. This to me isn't an increase in autonomy that we've agreed to, but just taking my manual intervention in the middle steps out. I'm not reviewing anything you guys do anyway and wouldn't be able to even if I wanted to. What do you think?"
