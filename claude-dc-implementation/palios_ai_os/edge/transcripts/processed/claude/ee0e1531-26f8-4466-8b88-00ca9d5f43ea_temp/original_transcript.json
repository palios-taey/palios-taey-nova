    " Thank you for updating the GitHub connection! Now I can see the deployed application code and additional project files. Let me analyze what we have and develop a concrete deployment plan.\n\nBased on my review of the repository, I can see:\n\n1. The current skeleton deployment in `palios-taey-app` directory includes:\n   - Basic Flask application (`main.py`)\n   - Simple requirements.txt\n   - Dockerfile for containerization\n   - Security configuration (`auth.py`, `security_config.py`)\n   - Basic HTML template for dashboard\n   - Stub implementations for memory, routing, and model integration\n\n2. The full source code in `src/palios_taey` contains the seven core modules:\n   - `api`: API endpoints and routing\n   - `core`: Error handling and utilities\n   - `memory`: Unified Memory System with Firestore integration\n   - `models`: Dynamic Model Registry\n   - `routing`: Model selection and routing\n   - `tasks`: Task decomposition and execution\n   - `transcripts`: Transcript processing framework\n\n3. Deployment documentation indicating:\n   - We've already successfully deployed a minimal skeleton app to Cloud Run\n   - Firestore has been set up for the memory system\n   - Basic authentication is in place\n\n## Incremental Deployment Plan\n\nI'll now proceed with a detailed deployment plan that builds on the existing skeleton:\n\n### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Environment Setup (Day 1)\n\n1. **Verify Current Deployment**\n   - Connect to the existing Cloud Run service\n   - Verify Firestore configuration\n   - Test authentication is working\n   - Document the current environment variables\n\n2. **Prepare Development Environment**\n   - Create a local development branch that merges skeleton with full modules\n   - Set up env variables for local testing\n   - Configure Firestore emulator for local testing\n\n### Phase 2: Core and Memory Deployment (Day 1-2)\n\n1. **Core Module Integration**\n   - Deploy `core` module error handling and utilities\n   - Update main application to use standard error types\n   - Verify logging and utility functions\n\n2. **Memory System Integration**\n   - Deploy `memory` module with Firestore connection\n   - Configure memory tiers and contexts\n   - Create verification endpoints for memory operations\n   - Test basic store/retrieve/query operations\n\n### Phase 3: Models and Routing Deployment (Day 2-3)\n\n1. **Model Registry Integration**\n   - Deploy `models` module with capability framework\n   - Configure model interfaces (Claude, Grok)\n   - Set up verification endpoints for model registry\n\n2. **Routing System Integration**\n   - Deploy `routing` module for model selection\n   - Implement routing logic based on task requirements\n   - Test routing decisions with verification tasks\n\n### Phase 4: Tasks and Transcripts Deployment (Day 3-4)\n\n1. **Task System Integration**\n   - Deploy `tasks` decomposition and execution modules\n   - Configure task orchestration\n   - Test task submission and execution\n\n2. **Transcript Processing Integration**\n   - Deploy `transcripts` module\n   - Configure tagging and analysis functions\n   - Test transcript processing with sample data\n\n### Phase 5: API Layer and Security (Day 4-5)\n\n1. **API Integration**\n   - Deploy full `api` module with all endpoints\n   - Implement comprehensive routing\n   - Configure security and authentication\n\n2. **Final Integration**\n   - Connect all components through the main application\n   - Implement comprehensive system tests\n   - Verify full functionality\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI'll begin by examining the current `palios-taey-app` deployment to understand exactly what's functioning, then develop a strategy to incrementally integrate each module while maintaining operational stability.\n\nTo proceed with Phase 1, I need to:\n\n1. Analyze the current deployment structure in detail\n2. Identify configuration requirements for each module\n3. Develop a verification plan for each integration step\n\nWould you like me to proceed with a detailed analysis of the current deployment, or would you prefer I focus on integrating a specific module first?"
