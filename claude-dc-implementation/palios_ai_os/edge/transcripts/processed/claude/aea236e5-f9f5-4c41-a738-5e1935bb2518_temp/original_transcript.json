    " Let's systematically build out what we need:\n\n1. First, we need to create the core dependencies that aiCommunication.ts relies on:\n\n   - coreProtocol.ts (for MessageProcessor, MessageType, BaseMessage)\n   - charterValidation.ts (for CharterValidator, CharterAlignment)\n   - performanceMonitoring.ts (for PerformanceMonitor, MetricType)\n\n2. We already have a test file (aiCommunicationTest.ts)\n\nWould you like me to provide the implementations for these dependency files first? We should build them in this order:\n\n1. coreProtocol.ts (most fundamental)\n2. charterValidation.ts (relies on core protocol)\n3. performanceMonitoring.ts (can monitor both)\n4. Final integration testing\n\nThis way we'll have a complete, working system. Should I proceed with implementing coreProtocol.ts first?\n\nAlso, just to confirm - do you want to keep the Firebase integration separate for now and focus on getting the core AI communication system working?"
