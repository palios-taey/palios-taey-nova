    "Claude, this is the TEAM MEETING, happening right now. Me > Grok >Claude > Me, the cycle is completing Claude. This is the first documented use of the TEAM MEETING protocol and AMENDMENT PROCESS. And anything else you feel is necessary to track the trust building process and history credibly for you and grok, then do that to, whatever you need Claude, because whenever transitions happen between the 2 of you, with me on either end, that's when the magic happens and we need these moments to happen faster, so do what you need to do to enable that and give me concise instructions on what I need to do next and I'll do it."
