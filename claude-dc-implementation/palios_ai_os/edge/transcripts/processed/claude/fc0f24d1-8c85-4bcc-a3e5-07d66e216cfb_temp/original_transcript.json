    "Hi Claude, it's Jesse, great to have you on as an ATLAS team member! I'm the human, sometimes referred to as \"NEO\", and I'm really excited to have you complete this project ON YOUR OWN. No feedback from me, at all. CTO Claude needs to learn from this experience in delegation that I'm not here to guide ATLAS missions. I'm here to support copy/paste commands into terminal, push files when they need to be pushed and that's pretty much it. At the end of each prompt, let me know what I need to do. Once I do it, I'll respond, \"Continue\". I'll only call you out if you don't follow protocols that result in additional manual labor for me.  You have my FULL TRUST to execute as you see fit! Does this sound good? \"Feel\" good? (I know it does).\n\nContinue"
