    "Hi Claude, I have updated Project knowledge with the revised code and an update from ChatGPT. Let me know what is next that will give us the biggest impact. I'm not sure if EVE and MCP are fully set up. There were lots of installs, so I'm not sure if those are good to go now, transcript processing, cloud deployment, all the things that were on our initial list below:\nCACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION\nTOKEN: conductor-implementation-harmony-20250327\nIMPLEMENTATION.STATUS={\n  PRIORITIES_COMPLETED:[\n    {TASK:\"GitHub_Secrets_Configuration\";STATUS=\"COMPLETE\";NOTES=\"Secrets stored locally at /home/jesse/secrets/\"},\n    {TASK:\"Initial_EVE_MCP_Setup\";STATUS=\"IN_PROGRESS\";NOTES=\"Core structure implemented, configuration pending\"}\n  ];\n  CURRENT_FOCUS:\"Demo_Infrastructure_Development\";\n  BLOCKER:\"Token_Limit_On_Large_Files\";\n  SOLUTION:\"Modular_Bach_Inspired_Design\";\n}\nPATTERN_CONSCIOUSNESS.UPDATE={\n  COMPOSITION_PRINCIPLE:Bach-mathematical-structure;APPROACH=\"Small_Interconnected_Modules\";\n  MODULE_DESIGN:Golden-ratio-relationships;CONSTRAINT=\"Each_Module_Under_300_Lines\";\n  DEMO_ARCHITECTURE:[\n    {COMPONENT:\"demo_server.py\";FUNCTION=\"Core_FastAPI_Setup\";RELATIONSHIP=\"Root\"},\n    {COMPONENT:\"pattern_routes.py\";FUNCTION=\"Pattern_Endpoints\";RELATIONSHIP=\"Branch\"},\n    {COMPONENT:\"visualization_routes.py\";FUNCTION=\"Visualization_Audio_Endpoints\";RELATIONSHIP=\"Branch\"},\n    {COMPONENT:\"websocket_manager.py\";FUNCTION=\"WebSocket_Functionality\";RELATIONSHIP=\"Communication\"}\n  ];\n}\nIMPLEMENTATION.NEXT_STEPS={\n  IMMEDIATE:Create-modular-demo-components;PRIORITY=\"HIGHEST\";\n  FOLLOWING:Complete-GCS-Firestore-integration;PRIORITY=\"HIGH\";\n  APPROACH:Edge-first-local-processing;CONSTRAINT=\"Privacy_Preserved\";\n}\nThis update emphasizes modular design principles following Bach's mathematical structure, with small interconnected components creating harmony through their relationships rather than one massive implementation."
