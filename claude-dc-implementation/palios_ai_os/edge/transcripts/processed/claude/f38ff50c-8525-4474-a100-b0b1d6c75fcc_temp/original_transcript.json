    " Great! The test ran successfully and the dashboard is showing the metrics are being tracked properly. The system is measuring response time efficiency at 16.36 seconds, which is considered \"Good\" by the performance indicators.\n\nAs expected, we're seeing two Level 1 (Incremental) breakthrough assessments. Since Level 1 is not counted as a breakthrough in our scoring model, the Breakthrough Density shows as 0.00.\n\nBehind the scenes, the new performance monitoring framework is now collecting detailed data about these assessments in the `breakthroughScoringData` collection in your Firestore database. This data includes:\n\n- The full interaction text\n- Detailed scoring factors that contributed to the assessment\n- Confidence scores for the automated decisions\n- Factor-level analysis like keyword matches and complexity scores\n\nTo verify the data collection is working properly, you can check your Firebase console to see if the new collection has been created with entries matching your test interactions.\n\nThe next step would be to implement either the validation dashboard or CLI tool to begin collecting human feedback on these automated assessments. This feedback will create the training dataset needed to refine the scoring algorithm.\n\nWould you like me to provide instructions for implementing the validation tools or would you prefer to focus on analyzing the data that's already being collected?"
