    " Great, I can see that OpenAI API is working successfully since we got back the list of available models. For Vertex AI, I see you have gcloud installed but it's asking for a region selection. Let's select a region and continue the setup:\n\n1. In the gcloud terminal, enter `30` for us-central1 (this is a standard choice that works well with most services)\n\nAfter selecting the region, let's create a simple Python script to test both APIs and Firestore integration. First, we need to set up a Python environment:\n\n1. Install Python (if not already installed):\n- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/\n- Download and install the latest version for your OS\n- Make sure to check \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation\n\n2. Create a new directory for our project and install required packages. Open Command Prompt and run:\n```bash\nmkdir ai-execution-system\ncd ai-execution-system\npip install google-cloud-firestore openai google-cloud-aiplatform python-dotenv\n```\n\nLet me know once you've completed these steps and I'll provide the test script to verify all connections are working properly."
