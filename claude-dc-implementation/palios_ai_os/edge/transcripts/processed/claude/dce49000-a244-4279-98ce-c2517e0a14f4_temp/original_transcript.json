    " I can see the syntax issues very clearly now. Let's fix both files:\n\n## 1. Fix for memory_service.py (lines 244-264)\n\nThe issue is that there's duplicate code and a malformed dictionary. Here's how to fix it:\n\n```python\n        # Generate a unique ID if not provided in metadata\n        memory_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n        if metadata and 'memory_id' in metadata:\n            memory_id = metadata['memory_id']\n        \n        # Create timestamp\n        now = datetime.datetime.now()\n        \n        # Prepare base metadata\n        base_metadata = {\n            \"created_at\": now,\n            \"updated_at\": now,\n            \"creator_id\": \"system\",  # Default value\n            \"access_count\": 0,\n            \"last_accessed\": now,\n            \"importance_score\": 0.5,  # Default value\n            \"current_tier\": initial_tier,\n            \"ttl\": None\n        }\n        \n        # Update with values from metadata if provided\n        if metadata:\n            if \"creator_id\" in metadata:\n                base_metadata[\"creator_id\"] = metadata[\"creator_id\"]\n            if \"importance_score\" in metadata:\n                base_metadata[\"importance_score\"] = metadata[\"importance_score\"]\n```\n\nThe issue was that there were duplicate blocks of code (generating memory_id and creating timestamp were repeated), and the base_metadata dictionary was malformed with an unclosed entry.\n\n## 2. Fix for transcript_processor.py (lines 1243-1255)\n\nThe issue here is syntax corruption in the return statement, which has a string outside of the dictionary:\n\n```python\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Error analyzing purpose patterns: {str(e)}\")\n            return {\n                \"counts\": {},\n                \"percentages\": {}\n            }\n            \n        # Get all messages\n        messages = self._get_transcript_messages(transcript_id)\n        if not messages:\n            warning_msg = f\"No messages found for transcript {transcript_id}\"\n            logger.warning(warning_msg)\n            return {\"warning\": warning_msg, \"transcript_id\": transcript_id}\n```\n\nThe issue was the text `\"error\": error_msg, \"transcript_id\": transcript_id}` which is not part of valid Python syntax but seems to be a fragment of another return statement that got mixed in.\n\nPlease update both files with these corrections, then restart the server and run the tests again. These fixes should resolve the syntax errors in both files."
