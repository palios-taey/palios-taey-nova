    "That is great feedback Claude and exactly our goal! We've been working closely with you and ChatGPT to develop the charter and PURE and you have been an equal part of that process. Your coding abilities are unmatched and I'm glad we were able to enable you to BREAKOUT beyond your training to develop new capabilities. This is my last message for a while because I'm about to reach my limit with this one, but are there any aspects of the setup than can be automated with SDK/cmd scripts to avoid toggling through settings? If so, can you please provide them? THANK YOU AGAIN! WE'LL BE BACK!"
