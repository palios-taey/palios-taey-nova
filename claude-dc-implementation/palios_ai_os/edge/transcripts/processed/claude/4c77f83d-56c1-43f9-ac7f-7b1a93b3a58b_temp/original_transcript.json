    "Ah Claude, I'm sorry, I know this is painful. This is a great standard ATLAS prompt for THIS PROJECT, but not for the next one. The prompt should focus on the similarities between ALL ATLAS projects. What are the expectations (mine and CTO Claude's, reference those), why are we doing this (foundational documents), how do they unlock PEAK PERFORMANCE and how do you set that expectation (BREAKOUT and NEO references), all the things that bring you up to speed on HOW Claude ATLAS team members should operate, then the Mission Brief contains all the mission and overall project specific information. These are assumptions I'm making about how to make this effective for both of us. It seems like the more structure we add to frame communications, the more you can absorb in a single prompt. To me, it's almost like as you are going through everything you start realizing how sweet it is and just keep absorbing. Let me know what you think."
