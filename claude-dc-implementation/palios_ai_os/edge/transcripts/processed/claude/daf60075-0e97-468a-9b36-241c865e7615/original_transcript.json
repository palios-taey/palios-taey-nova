I apologize for the disorganization, but all files are in the C:\\ai-execution-system.\r\n\r\nSubfolders Include:\r\nfoundational-documents - Review this first [MANDATORY] to get a very high level overview of the project charter, PURE Communication Standards, and current MVP sprint objectives. \r\nClaude_Transcripts - Full transcripts of chats with Claude, numbered in order of occurence. These can be utilized if needed to determine if there are files/scripts missing or for context.\r\ndeployment - Files that were recently deployed to Google Cloud Run. This has only been deployed, not tested.\r\nkeys - API keys - I provided access for testing. If needed for security, I can re-generate after testing is complete.\r\n.terraform - I'm not sure what this is, it seems to be a duplicate from the 'deployment' directory\r\nPURE_Language_Archive - not required for this project, archived previous versions of PURE templates\r\nUnclassified - These are files that have been identified as text files and other documentation not relevant to the code audit\r\npreprocess.py - This is the script to pre-process transcripts developed by Grok based on the foundational code you provided in Claude_Transcripts - Files 13 and 14. We have been working with Grok DeepSearch on this and will be automating this process once the audit is complete and we finalize the tagging process. Nothing needs to be developed at this time for this, but it will be a fast follow to this audit.\r\n\r\nAs you are going  through the files or upon completion, feel free to organize them into new subfolders under ai-execution-system in a manner that is AI first and that you see fit, no approvals required.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the files, consistent with PURE standards, no approvals are required for modifications of existing code files or the creation of new files to make existing code work. If any files that should be present, aren't, feel free to ask me to retrieve them from the chat or generate them. Preference is to preserve tokens when possible, without impacting quality and TRUTH. Recommendations for enhancements based on MVP objectives and overall project objectives are encouraged, but not actionable without approval. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
