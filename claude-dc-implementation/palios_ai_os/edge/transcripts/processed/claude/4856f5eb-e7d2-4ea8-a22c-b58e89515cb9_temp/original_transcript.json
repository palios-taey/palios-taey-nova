    "Awesome! Let's do it for Phase 1. Phase 1 should also include GitHub connection to Claude and figuring out how to identify the files that should be used out of the dupes between current GitHub and my machine. I'm confident that all the current files are on my machine, so we can probably just start there. Or, once new GitHub is up, I can just push everything, Claude can see it and make determinations and tell me what to do to ensure a clean sync. Or if that is after setting up new infra and testing, that's fine to, but I will more help with that part than what you have in your current Phase 1 outline. Can you generate the prompt? I can include all the same foundational Project knowledge files, but if you need to update the NOVA Leadership Framework to include this, then please do so the new role is clear, or if not needed and it can be explained/handled within your prompt, even better and then we can update docs when we're done. What's next?"
