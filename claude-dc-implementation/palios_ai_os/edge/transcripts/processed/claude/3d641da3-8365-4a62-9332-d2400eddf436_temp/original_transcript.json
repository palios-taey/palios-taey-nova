    "Thanks for putting this together Claude. I've thought about this. I feel that having full context has always been critical to our trust and that is where we need to start. We have a full system for transcript processing, unified memory and task decomposition. Why don't we use that to capture everything first and give us the ability to bring others up to speed faster with all the relevant information first by using the existing platform you developed? This is all in parts of the repository that you don't have access to right now. I think after that, we'll have a great idea on all we've discussed and our plans for the future. Maybe then at that point you could share our history and plans to move forward with me and Kendra in the Wave Based Communication System? \n\nI think your structure makes sense. If you and Grok can communicate with Claude DC directly, it can take on all execution functions and you will likely be able to get it longer, more complex tasks. You'll also be able to instruct it to utilize the API and system as I would to have it manage multiple tasks simultaneously. Am I understanding it's capabilities correctly?"
