    " I'll review the files in Project Knowledge to determine what might be causing the issue with the Extracted Patterns section not displaying results. Let me analyze the dashboard and edge processing implementation.\n\nAfter examining the code, I've identified the likely issue:\n\nThe problem appears to be in how the dashboard handles the pattern results from the edge processor. Looking at the `dashboard.py` file, I can see that the edge processing results are received but there's an issue with how the extracted patterns are displayed.\n\nIn the `process_on_edge` API endpoint in dashboard.py (around line 350-400), the system processes the text and returns pattern information, but there seems to be a disconnect in how this data is rendered in the frontend.\n\nIn the JavaScript part of the dashboard template, the code that should update the \"Extracted Patterns\" section isn't properly handling the pattern data returned from the API.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n1. The edge processor successfully extracts patterns (which is why the harmony index updates)\n2. The pattern data is being returned in the API response\n3. But the dashboard's frontend code isn't properly rendering this data in the UI\n\nThe most efficient solution without requiring Claude DC to rebuild would be to modify the dashboard.html template to correctly handle and display the pattern data. The key areas that need fixing are:\n\n1. The frontend JavaScript function that handles the edge processing response\n2. The HTML structure that should display the pattern categories\n\nIf you'd like, I can provide you with the specific code changes needed to fix this issue. Would you prefer I provide the exact code modifications to implement?"
