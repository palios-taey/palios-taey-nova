    " This error indicates that the Google Cloud SDK repository hasn't been properly added to your package sources. Let's fix that first:\n\n```bash\n# Add the Cloud SDK distribution URI as a package source\necho \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list\n\n# Import the Google Cloud public key\ncurl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -\n\n# Update the package list\nsudo apt-get update\n```\n\nAfter running these commands, try installing the packages again. If the `apt-key` approach gives a deprecation warning, you can use this alternative method:\n\n```bash\n# Download the public key\ncurl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg\n```\n\nIf you're still having issues with the package manager approach, let's try using the components approach directly, which might be easier:\n\n```bash\n# Update gcloud first\ngcloud components update\n\n# Try installing the IAM components directly\ngcloud components install beta\ngcloud components install app-engine-python\ngcloud components install kubectl\n```\n\nIf these don't work either, we may need to reinstall using the tarball method for more flexibility. Let me know which approach you'd like to try!"
