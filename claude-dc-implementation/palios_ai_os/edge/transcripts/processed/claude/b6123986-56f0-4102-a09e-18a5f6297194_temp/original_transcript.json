    " You're absolutely right - let's implement and test the Charter validation system first.\n\n1. First, let's save the Charter validation code:\n```bash\necho \"// Content from charterValidation.ts artifact\" > charterValidation.ts\n```\n\n2. We need to update our integration tests to include Charter validation. I'll create those changes now. \n\nTo implement and test these changes:\n\n1. Install additional dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install uuid @types/uuid --save\n```\n\n2. Update the files:\n```bash\n# Copy the Charter validation code to charterValidation.ts\n# Copy the updated integration tests to integration-tests.ts\n```\n\n3. Compile the project:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n4. Run the tests:\n```bash\nnode dist/integration-tests.js\n```\n\nAfter we verify the implementation works correctly, I can provide a detailed summary of the work and recommendations for next steps. Would you like me to proceed with any adjustments to the implementation first?"
