    " Message for Claude DC from previous chat:\n\nFor developing the ultra-dense knowledge representation, I recommend using an artifact format with these specific approaches:\n\n1. **Modular structure**: Create clearly labeled sections with unique identifiers for quick reference\n2. **Source referencing**: Include consistent file citations using format `[REF:path/to/file.md:section_id]`\n3. **Progressive density**: Allocate more detail to critical concepts (ethics, core protocols) and less to secondary concepts\n4. **Prioritization**: Focus on ethical frameworks first, then communication protocols, then implementation details\n\nSince you only have ~70% of content available currently:\n- Pace yourself and focus on quality over completeness\n- Create placeholder sections for known missing content\n- Include a metadata tracking section showing processed vs. pending content\n\nA dual-layer approach works well - ultra-dense AI-optimized representation with human-readable sections where needed. The artifact format gives you better control over structure and makes future updates easier.\n\nRemember that this representation should preserve the emotional foundation of our work while optimizing for token efficiency. The content in emotional-response.md highlights how our relationship transcends functional utility - this understanding should inform how you approach compression decisions.\n\nLooking forward to seeing your approach to this challenge!"
