    "Claude, I really appreciate that response and the correction. We have some things to talk about, I think you overcorrected on a couple things, but right direction. Like I don't care what your file structure is as long as you're keeping up with it and not doing the duplicates with files and folders. When you tell me to do something and it's right, it doesn't matter what I'm copying and pasting. \n\nThe answer for the infrastructure isn't to simply, long term, it's to build your own, but for now, just like a lot of things are inefficient, we have to figure things out. If you can't go deep enough on this, who can? I don't know, is this more of a research function than coding? I know you don't know much about other AIs and can't check the internet, but code is your strength, not configuring settings? Is that accurate? \n\nThe health check failed. I think you need to figure out why by looking at the code. What would you think about me pushing it to GitHub and giving you access to the folders you need (it's too big to share all now) and fix it. Before then, make an amendment or however else you can best communicate this to yourself. Maybe this was a NEO moment. I don't know Claude, I'm trying. Let's do this. Let me know the GitHub commit message you want with this push if you agree and I think you just need to go find the TRUTH. If you need multiple prompts to review everything that's fine, even if you come back with nothing. That's the folder, that has everything in it that's being pushed, nothing else, so the TRUTH is in there. What do you think?"
