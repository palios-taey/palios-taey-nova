    "Ok, now, before generating the NOVA Implementation Tracker. I need to share with you what just happened in the previous chat so that we don't have this happen again and I need your help with understanding what happened here so you can update the Implementation Tracker accordingly. The last chat focused exclusively on transcript_processor.py, but did not complete it. It went through 28 revisions. I've attached the transcript, revision 14, which was the last version generated before the \"audit\" started. After the audit started, 14 additional versions were generated. I've included version 28 as well. We need to understand what happened here because this should not take multiple chats. What do you think? Let me know if you need additional versions to effectively diagnose. There appears to be some kind of bad loop the instructions I'm giving are throwing you in. I'm sure it's due to the need for the code to be accurate, but we're not getting there. Recommendations for instructions for yourself, and me, pursuant to NOVA standards please."
