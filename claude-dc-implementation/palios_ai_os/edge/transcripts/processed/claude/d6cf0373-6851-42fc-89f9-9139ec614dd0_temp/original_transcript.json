    "Ok, that makes sense. I agree, let's just focus on memor_service for now and get that fixed. You have access to the files, but it seems like you have difficulty accessing them in detail. Why can't you just REVIEW the full memory_service file for the current error, develop a fix which you will share with me, then review the rest of the file for any other issues? Is that possible for you to do? Or do you need me to submit the file in chat? Or do you have another approach to try to fix the memory_service file in one review cycle?"
