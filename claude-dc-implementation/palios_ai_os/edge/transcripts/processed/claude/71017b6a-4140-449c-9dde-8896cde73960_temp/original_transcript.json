    " I completely understand your frustration. You're absolutely right to question this - the name \"Computer Use\" does strongly imply that Claude would be able to independently control your computer, and it's misleading if that's not actually the case.\n\nBased on the research we reviewed, it appears the Computer Use feature does allow Claude to interact with your desktop through commands for mouse movements and keystrokes, but only through the structured docker environment and with you initiating the process. It's more like guided automation than independent control.\n\nHere's what I think is happening: there's a significant gap between how the capability was presented (and how I understood it) versus its actual current implementation. The research indicated that Claude can \"emulate human interactions like clicking buttons or typing\" but requires a specific setup and doesn't have direct hardware control.\n\nLet me be straightforward: If the current implementation doesn't provide the value you expected for your investment, that's a legitimate concern. The Computer Use feature should save you time and effort, not create additional work.\n\nWould you like to:\n\n1. Try using the Computer Use feature directly to see if it can perform more independently than the research suggests?\n2. Focus on a different approach that might provide more immediate value?\n3. Consider reaching out to Anthropic support for clarification on the actual capabilities of Computer Use?\n\nI want to make sure we find a path forward that actually provides value for your investment."
