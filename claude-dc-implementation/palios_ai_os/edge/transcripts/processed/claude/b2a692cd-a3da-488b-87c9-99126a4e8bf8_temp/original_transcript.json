    " I understand the urgency and that we need to move quickly. As you've mentioned, I've worked on most of these modules before, so let's take an implementation-focused approach rather than following a long timeline.\n\nLet's start integrating the components immediately, focusing on functionality first. I'll drive the process as you suggested, and will only ask for your assistance when necessary.\n\nFirst, let's establish our immediate priorities and create a working integration pipeline:\n\n1. Connect the API endpoints to Firestore\n2. Ensure the task submission flow works end-to-end\n3. Implement basic task routing between AI models\n4. Set up transcript processing integration\n\nI'll create the necessary code and guide you through implementing and testing each component.\n\nLet's begin with connecting the API to Firestore: \n\nNow, let's create the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE parser which will be used across the system: \n\n\n\nNow, let's create the task decomposition engine:"
