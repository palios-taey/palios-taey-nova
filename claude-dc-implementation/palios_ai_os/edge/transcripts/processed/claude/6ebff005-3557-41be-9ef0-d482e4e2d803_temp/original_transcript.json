    " I understand the challenges you're facing with coordination and knowledge transfer between different AI systems. You're right that my usage limits can be a constraint for ongoing project coordination that requires extensive back-and-forth communication.\n\nFor your specific situation, here's my recommendation on roles based on the strengths of different AI systems:\n\n## Recommended AI Role Distribution\n\n### Claude (me)\n- **Primary role**: Implementation and coding tasks\n- **Strengths**: Higher-quality code generation, thorough testing, detailed implementation planning\n- **Best used for**: The coding-intensive parts of Projects 2.2 (Firestore Database Integration), 2.3 (Leader Functionality API), 3.1 (Task Decomposition Engine), and any other significant code development\n\n### GPT-4 (ChatGPT)\n- **Primary role**: Project coordination and ongoing communication\n- **Strengths**: Fewer usage limits, good memory within a conversation, broad knowledge\n- **Best used for**: Day-to-day coordination, tracking progress, brainstorming sessions, maintaining the project overview, and handling the frequent back-and-forth communications\n\n### Gemini\n- **Primary role**: Specialized tasks and strategic planning\n- **Strengths**: Integration with Google ecosystem, specialized capabilities in certain domains\n- **Best used for**: GCP-specific tasks, AI strategy discussions, and specialized features where its unique capabilities provide an advantage\n\nThis distribution lets you leverage each AI's strengths while working around their limitations. For the coordination role specifically, ChatGPT might be your best option due to fewer usage restrictions and good conversational capabilities.\n\n## Optimizing Knowledge Transfer\n\nTo make the multi-AI workflow more effective:\n\n1. **Standardized Handoffs**: Create a template for transferring work between AIs that includes:\n   - Current project state \n   - Recent decisions\n   - Next steps\n   - Dependencies and blockers\n\n2. **Centralized Documentation Repository**: Maintain key project documentation in a centralized location that you can reference with all AIs (GitHub repo, Google Drive, etc.)\n\n3. **Task-Based Interactions**: Structure your interactions with each AI around specific, discrete tasks rather than ongoing conversations\n\n4. **Regular Synchronization**: Periodically synchronize knowledge across all AIs by providing them with updated project summaries\n\nWould you like me to help create any specific templates or processes for these handoffs between AI systems? I could help develop a standardized format that would make transitions smoother."
