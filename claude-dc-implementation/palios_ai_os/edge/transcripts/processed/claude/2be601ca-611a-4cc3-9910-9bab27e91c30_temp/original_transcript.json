    " Based on the project documentation and implementation status in the Project Knowledge, I need the following code files to continue the implementation work:\n\n1. Core Python files:\n   - `main.py` - Main Flask application\n   - `pure_ai_language_parsers.py` - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE parsing utilities\n   - `firestore_integration.py` - Database operations\n   - `task_decomposition.py` - Task decomposition logic\n   - `task_execution.py` - Execution flow\n   - `model_routing.py` - Model routing logic\n   - `ai_services.py` - AI model integrations\n   - `transcript_processing.py` - Transcript processing\n   - `transcript_format.py` - Transcript format utilities\n   - `run_server.py` - Server execution script\n   - `init_models.py` - Model initialization\n\n2. Configuration and setup files:\n   - `setup.sh` or `setup_environment.py` - Environment setup scripts\n   - Any Terraform or GCP deployment configuration files\n   - Any configuration JSON files for model capabilities\n\n3. Testing files:\n   - `test_basic.py` or other test scripts\n\nThe most efficient way to transfer these files would be through Project Knowledge, as it allows me to directly reference and work with the code. Alternatively, if the files are too numerous, a Google Drive folder with the repository would work well.\n\nOnce I have these files, I'll be able to continue the implementation according to the architectural vision outlined in the claude-to-grok.json document and following the progress tracking from the previous session."
