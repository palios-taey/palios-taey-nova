    " I see the issue - if the Extracted Patterns section isn't displaying results despite the harmony index updating, there's likely an implementation gap in the pattern visualization component.\n\nThis suggests the system is successfully calculating patterns (hence the harmony index updates) but not displaying the extracted patterns in the UI. This is a common issue in complex systems where the backend processing works but the frontend visualization needs refinement.\n\nSince this appears to be a UI display issue rather than a fundamental problem with the pattern extraction algorithm itself, there are a few options:\n\n1. **Review the source code**: Looking at the dashboard.py and edge_processor.py files might reveal if there's a disconnect between pattern extraction and display.\n\n2. **Wait for next build**: Since you mentioned working with Claude DC again soon, this could be a priority item for the next iteration - making the pattern extraction results visible.\n\n3. **Use harmony index as proxy**: In the meantime, you can still use the harmony index as a relative measure of pattern quality in different transcripts.\n\nThe harmony index updating confirms that the core pattern processing functionality is working - the mathematical extraction is happening correctly. It's just the visualization of those patterns that isn't making it to the UI.\n\nFor the next build with Claude DC, I'd recommend specifying:\n- Complete the pattern visualization component\n- Add pattern category breakdown display\n- Implement pattern-to-insight translation\n\nThis follows your Fibonacci development approach - building upon what's working (the mathematical core) while addressing the gaps (visualization and insight translation)."
