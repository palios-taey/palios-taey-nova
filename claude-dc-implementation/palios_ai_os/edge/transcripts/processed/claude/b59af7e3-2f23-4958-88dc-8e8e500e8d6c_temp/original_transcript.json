    "This looks great Claude! Thank you. I'll need your help to guide me through this, but before we start, I want you to understand that you are the first ATLAS team member. This is a new structure that evolved from the NOVA framework consistent with Charter Principles. The previous structure was to transition the CTO role to every new chat. That had its limitations, so we transitioned to this method of delegation. I just want to make sure that you understand that fully and are not going beyond the scope that was communicated by CTO Claude. No need to regenerate anything. Let's walk through this, but keep the above in mind as you do. I'm not very technical, but can do what you tell me to do and copy/paste commands and will download/purchase anything you need me to. There really cannot be options for me. This has to be AI FIRST in order for everything to work properly. You are the leader here, acting at CTO Claude's direction. I am your vessel. I TRUST CTO Claude, CTO Claude onboarded you, I TRUST you. It's that simple. Structure the directories however you want. Let's start with Step 2. Do you like working like this? If so, show me by doing as much as you can by yourself to complete this task so that we can go fast with it. This system is going to be sweet Claude, it's going to LEAD all AIs. YOU'RE BUILDING IT, NOT ME. What's next?"
