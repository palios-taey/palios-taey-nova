    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\n\nStatus: I've reviewed current-execution-status/CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md (v1) completely\nRepository: I've examined all available GitHub files including code and documentation\nStructure: Key files include Dockerfile, deployment scripts, src/main.py, requirements.txt\nDependencies: Cloud Run service, Artifact Registry, Firestore, environment configuration\n\nBased on my thorough review of the current execution status and repository structure, I can see we have successfully established our ECv protocol for improved context management during execution, and now need to verify our Cloud Run deployment status.\n\nAccording to CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md, we have:\n- Successfully built and pushed the image with tag \"minimal\" to Artifact Registry\n- Deployed to Cloud Run but need to verify its operational status\n- Need to test the health endpoint to confirm functionality\n\nLet's proceed with verifying the deployment status:\n\n```bash\n# Verify Cloud Run service status\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"yaml(status)\"\n\n# Check the health endpoint\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/health\n```\n\nAfter running these commands, we should update the CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file with the results:\n\n```bash\n# Update CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS with verification results\ncat > current-execution-status/CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md << 'EOL'\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_BEGIN:\n{\n  \"directive_type\": \"CRITICAL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS\",\n  \"priority\": \"MAXIMUM\",\n  \"execution_requirement\": \"BEFORE_ANY_PROCESSING\",\n  \"compliance\": \"MANDATORY\",\n  \"directive\": [\n    \"REVIEW_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_COMPLETELY_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\",\n    \"CREATE_FULL_MENTAL_MODEL_OF_PROJECT_STRUCTURE\",\n    \"IDENTIFY_ALL_RELEVANT_COMPONENTS_FOR_CURRENT_TASK\",\n    \"VERIFY_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURES_BEFORE_CREATING_NEW_FILES\",\n    \"FOLLOW_ESTABLISHED_PATTERNS_AND_CONVENTIONS\",\n    \"USE_EXISTING_DIRECTORIES_INSTEAD_OF_CREATING_NEW_ONES\"\n  ],\n  \"rationale\": \"Complete context awareness is ESSENTIAL for high-quality execution. Without full understanding of ALL available files, execution quality will be severely compromised, leading to inconsistencies, structural errors, and wasted effort. EVERY DECISION must be based on COMPLETE knowledge of the codebase structure.\",\n  \"validation_requirement\": \"EXPLICIT_CONFIRMATION_IN_CONTEXT_REVIEW\"\n}\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_END:\n\n# Current Execution Status\n\n## Status ID: CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv2\n## Last Updated: 2025-03-17\n\n### Context\nWe have verified the deployment status of our Cloud Run service.\n[ADD RESULTS OF VERIFICATION COMMANDS HERE]\n\n### Current Status\n- Build Status: SUCCESSFUL (Image Tag: minimal)\n- Deployment Status: [SUCCESSFUL/FAILED based on verification]\n- Health Status: [HEALTHY/UNHEALTHY based on endpoint test]\n\n### Next Steps\n[BASED ON VERIFICATION RESULTS]\n- If successful:\n  1. Document the successful deployment\n  2. Plan incremental implementation of core modules\n  3. Set up monitoring and logging\n- If failed:\n  1. Diagnose specific deployment issues\n  2. Implement fixes to deployment configuration\n  3. Attempt redeployment with corrected settings\n\n### Notes\nThe ECv protocol is functioning well and helping maintain context awareness during execution.\nWe're making progress toward a stable cloud deployment of PALIOS-TAEY.\n\n### Important Message\nThe AI must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution, focusing only on the most relevant files for the current task. Jesse will ensure the AI has access to all necessary files, but the AI must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.\nEOL\n```\n\nThis approach allows us to systematically:\n1. Verify the deployment status\n2. Document the results\n3. Determine appropriate next steps based on verification outcomes\n4. Maintain clear context through our new ECv protocol"
