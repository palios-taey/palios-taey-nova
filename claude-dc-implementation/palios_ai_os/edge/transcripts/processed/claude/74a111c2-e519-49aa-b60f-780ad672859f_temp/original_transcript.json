    " I'll create a clean version of main.py with the full functionality from server.py, incorporating the fixes we made. This will be ready for you to copy and paste. \n\nNow I'll create a module stub for the memory_service module, which appears to be used in the main.py file: \n\n\n\nHere's the clean, complete version of main.py for your PALIOS-TAEY system. This combines the full functionality from server.py with the fixes we made to make it deploy properly. Just copy and paste this to your src/main.py file:\n\nThe main.py file is now ready with all the functionality from the original server.py, but with the necessary fixes to work in the Cloud Run environment. The key changes I made were:\n\n1. Removed any bash scripting elements (no `cat >` or `EOF`)\n2. Ensured Flask dependencies are compatible with the pinned Werkzeug version\n3. Added proper health check endpoints\n\nI've also created a stub for the memory_service module to help with initialization if needed. You can use this as a starting point for creating the other module files if they're not already in place.\n\nOnce you save the main.py file, commit and push it to GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit add src/main.py\ngit commit -m \"Restore full PALIOS-TAEY functionality with deployment fixes\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis should trigger a new deployment with the complete system functionality."
