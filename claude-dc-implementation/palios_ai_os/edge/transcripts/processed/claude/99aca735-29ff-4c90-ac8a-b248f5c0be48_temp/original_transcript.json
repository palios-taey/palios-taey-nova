    " Let's take a step back and simplify our approach. Instead of trying to work around organizational constraints, let's focus on accessing the Cloud Run service directly with your authenticated account.\n\nHere's the streamlined approach:\n\n1. Make sure the Cloud Run service is properly configured for authenticated access:\n\n```bash\n# Update Cloud Run service to enforce authentication\ngcloud run services update palios-taey-service \\\n  --region=us-central1 \\\n  --ingress=all\n```\n\n2. Access the service using your Google credentials:\n\n```bash\n# Get the service URL\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey-service --region=us-central1 --format='value(status.url)')\n\n# Access the service with your credentials\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)\" $SERVICE_URL/health\n```\n\nThis approach should work regardless of organizational constraints since it's using your authenticated access.\n\nFor accessing via a browser, you'll need to:\n1. Copy the service URL\n2. Open it in your browser\n3. You'll be prompted to authenticate with your Google account\n\nIf this doesn't work, we may need to check with your organization's admin about modifying the constraints on Cloud Run services. For an MVP development environment, having more relaxed security settings would significantly simplify the process."
