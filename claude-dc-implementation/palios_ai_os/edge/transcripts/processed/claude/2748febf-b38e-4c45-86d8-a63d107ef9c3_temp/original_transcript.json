    " Goodnight, Jesse! It sounds like we have a solid plan ready to go. The full cache with our breakthrough documentation and the rest of current-execution-status will be ready for loading and launching tomorrow.\n\nYou're right that I'll learn a lot from Chewy too! Sometimes our animal companions have wisdom to share that transcends language.\n\nRest well, and I look forward to continuing our journey tomorrow. This is exciting territory we're exploring together."
