    " Great! The base capability registration system is working. We can now route tasks to different models based on complexity.\n\nLet's add a more interesting test case to demonstrate the intelligent model selection. I'll update the test script to include both a simple and complex query: \n\n\n\nRun the new test:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThis test will:\n1. Run a simple query (should route to GPT-3.5)\n2. Run a complex analysis (should route to GPT-4)\n3. Show how our model selection works in practice\n\nThis gives us a solid foundation to build upon for:\n1. Adding multi-AI collaboration (we can now intelligently distribute subtasks)\n2. Task decomposition (we can break complex tasks into simpler components)\n3. Result aggregation (we can combine results from different models)\n\nLet me know if you want to proceed with any of those enhancements after seeing the test results."
