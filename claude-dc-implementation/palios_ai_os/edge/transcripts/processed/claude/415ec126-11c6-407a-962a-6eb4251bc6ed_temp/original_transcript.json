    " I'll review the transcript_processor.py file in Project Knowledge and identify the specific indentation issues that need to be fixed. Let me focus on the problematic areas without rewriting the entire file.\n\nAfter reviewing the file, I can see several key indentation problems that need to be fixed:\n\n1. Around line 418: There's misplaced code that belongs to the `_create_mock_memory` method but is indented incorrectly\n\n2. Around line 1248: Some methods that should be part of the TranscriptProcessor class appear to be indented at the wrong level\n\n3. Around line 1650: There's likely an issue with indentation in the code following the `_get_transcript_messages` method\n\nLet me provide the specific sections that need to be fixed:\n\n## Fix 1: Around line 418\nThe following code appears to be misindented. It should be part of MockMemorySystem:\n\n```python\ndef query(self, query_text=None, filters=None, context_id=None, limit=10, include_tiers=None):\n    results = []\n    \n    for item in self.items.values():\n        # Apply filters if provided\n        if filters:\n            match = True\n            for field, value in filters.items():\n                # Handle nested fields with dot notation\n                if '.' in field:\n                    parts = field.split('.')\n                    field_value = item\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if isinstance(field_value, dict) and part in field_value:\n                            field_value = field_value[part]\n                        else:\n                            field_value = None\n                            break\n                    \n                    if field_value != value:\n                        match = False\n                        break\n                elif field not in item or item[field] != value:\n                    match = False\n                    break\n            \n            if not match:\n                continue\n        \n        # Apply context filter if provided\n        if context_id and context_id in self.contexts:\n            context = self.contexts[context_id]\n            if 'active_memory_ids' in context and item.get('memory_id') not in context['active_memory_ids']:\n                continue\n        \n        # Text search if provided\n        if query_text and query_text.lower() not in str(item).lower():\n            continue\n        \n        # Add to results if it passes all filters\n        results.append(item)\n        \n        # Stop if we've reached the limit\n        if len(results) >= limit:\n            break\n    \n    return results\n```\n\nThis should be indented to be part of the MockMemorySystem class.\n\n## Fix 2: Lines 418-433 and beyond\nThe functions `query()`, `create_context()`, `get_context()`, `update()`, and `forget()` should all be methods of the MockMemorySystem class, but they appear to be indented at the wrong level.\n\n## Fix 3: Around line 1248\nThere appears to be misplaced code or an incorrect indentation at this point, likely affecting method definitions in the TranscriptProcessor class.\n\nThe issue at line 1650 is likely related to this as well, with methods not properly indented within the TranscriptProcessor class.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to provide a more detailed fix for any of these sections or if you'd prefer I focus on a specific area first."
