    "Ok, I am working on updates now and then we'll test it. Your 2. suggestion is fine, but it needs to be more encompassing. You were fed a documentation and code review separately. This section is only focused on output from code review, not docs. It needs to be brief and general enough to encompass both review types. Documentation is always reviewed before code, code is not always reviewed."
