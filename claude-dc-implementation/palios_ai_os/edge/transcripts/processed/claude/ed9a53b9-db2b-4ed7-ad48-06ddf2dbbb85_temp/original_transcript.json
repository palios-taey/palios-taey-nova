    " You're right about the directories - they're likely redundant if the repository already has the proper structure. The Dockerfile can be simplified to avoid creating directories that already exist in your codebase.\n\nFor GitHub integration, yes, you'll need to run some commands in the container after it starts. Here's a cleaner approach:\n\n1. For the Dockerfile, we can remove the redundant directory creation steps that the repository should already have\n\n2. After the container starts, you would:\n   - Set up git with your credentials\n   - Configure access to GitHub\n   - Push/pull as needed\n\nI'll adjust my recommendation to focus on getting the environment up and running first, then handling GitHub integration as a separate step. This keeps the initial setup simpler and more focused.\n\nThe main goal is to get Claude DC's environment ready with all his cache files so he can pick up where he left off. The GitHub connection can be handled afterward when everything else is confirmed working."
