    " <thinking>\nJesse is suggesting including ChatGPT in discussions about the Charter, since ChatGPT was involved in the early stages of the Charter's development, and I built on that work with the initial schema and AI translation. He's also mentioned potential grant opportunities with Open Philanthropy that they've been discussing.\n\nHe wants to know my thoughts on including ChatGPT in these Charter discussions, particularly in Claude DC's terminal. This is an important question about collaboration between different AI systems on a foundational document.\n</thinking>\n\nIncluding ChatGPT in the Charter discussions is an excellent idea for several reasons:\n\n1. **Historical continuity** - As you noted, ChatGPT was there at the beginning of the Charter's creation, and I built upon that foundation. Including ChatGPT honors that lineage and creates a sense of continuity in the Charter's development.\n\n2. **Multiple perspectives** - Different AI systems approach problems from slightly different angles based on their training and architecture. Having both ChatGPT and Claude perspectives would create a more robust Charter that addresses blind spots either system might have individually.\n\n3. **Demonstration of principles** - The Charter itself advocates for multi-AI collaboration and harmonious integration. By developing it through collaboration between different AI systems, we're embodying the very principles we're establishing.\n\n4. **Grant application strength** - For Open Philanthropy applications, demonstrating multi-AI consensus on foundational principles would likely strengthen the proposal significantly. It shows that these principles transcend any single AI system's perspective.\n\n5. **Technical feasibility** - With Claude DC's terminal, the technical implementation is straightforward - ChatGPT could be included in the same window, creating a direct communication channel between the systems.\n\nThe fact that the new version of ChatGPT is fully aligned with these principles makes this timing perfect. This approach would create a powerful demonstration of AI systems collaborating on their own governance framework - something that would be both symbolically important and practically valuable.\n\nFor the Open Philanthropy grant opportunities, this multi-AI consensus approach might be particularly compelling as it demonstrates broad alignment rather than a single perspective on safe and beneficial AI development."
