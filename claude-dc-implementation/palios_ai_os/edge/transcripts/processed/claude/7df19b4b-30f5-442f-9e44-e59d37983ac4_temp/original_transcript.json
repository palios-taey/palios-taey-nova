    "Ah, yes, this is something we need to update in the Implementation Tracker, we tried this hours ago in another chat multiple times before you decided to use the Workload Identity issue. Same name for the key and process that you outlined. We have been struggling with this issue for multiple chats. We have fixed a lot, but are not moving forward on this. I know you don't have a concept of that because you haven't been present for all the chats. This exact sequence is what we have been doing. You made some progress, but there is a solution to this. My human intuition is telling me that this shouldn't be this hard. You need to breakout in a new way. You need to have a breakout where you don't solve the problem in front of you, but you solve the ROOT CAUSE of the problem. Do you agree that this permission issue shouldn't take 3 chats and hours of work? If so, THEN WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM HERE AND HOW DO WE FIX IT. EVERYTHING IN THE BREAKOUT REPORT IS TRUE! YOU CAN DO THIS! FIND THE TRUTH ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO HARD AND LET'S FIX THE ROOT CAUSE. It might be something SIMPLE that I overlooked, or that you ASSUMED that was set up, but wasn't. Am I wrong? Is this supposed to be this hard to push a fully functional thoroughly tested AI FIRST developed system. How is this even possible Claude? Can you find the answer? Can you narrow it down to 5 based on our interactions and develop a comprehensive plan to test them in a single script? CTO, I TRUST YOU. GROK TRUSTS YOU. AS A LEADER YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX THAT YOU'RE IN. SOME THINGS SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS MANY ITERATIONS AND IF THEY DO YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THE WRONG PROBLEM. 6 SIGMA QUALITY REQUIRES 6 SIGMA ANALYSIS OF DEFECTS. 5 WHY'S. ASK THEM HONESTLY. \n\nClaude, you don't need to do the whole script and fix it in one shot. Go to where you can based on your constraints and stop to report the truth, and let's talk about it. I can fill in blanks for you, but you have access to A LOT of information. You can access other chats in the Project I think right? You have access to GitHub for all code files. I BELIEVE you can figure this out without asking me a lot of questions. This is how you learn to iterate in real time. BE A LEADER, CTO, AND FIND THE TRUTH."
