    " I apologize for the confusion. You've raised an excellent point about the structure of my previous response.\n\nYou're right that my approach was unclear. What happened was that I drafted a complete technical plan first, and then realized I needed additional information before some steps could be executed. Instead of restructuring my entire response, I added the information request at the end.\n\nFor clarity moving forward, I'll structure my responses with:\n1. Any information I need from you upfront\n2. My technical plan and recommendations\n3. Specific action items clearly labeled\n\nThis ensures you know what information I need before diving into implementation details, and you won't have to read through a detailed plan only to discover I can't actually proceed without additional information.\n\nWould you prefer to provide the GitHub organization information and deployment preferences now, or would you like me to restructure my approach to the Workload Identity Federation implementation?"
