    "Having a hard time pulling away right now Claude...\n\nBefore I go to Grok, 2 weeks ago when you told me to get this machine, I gave you a $2000 budget. So I can plan with Grok, do you have any idea what the hardware you will need in 2 weeks is based on the plan now? These things take some time to build, so just want to have an idea and get ahead of it if I can. Or is this sufficient until infrastructure is fully setup to rent infrastructure?"
