We've now created a 'model' subfolder in our bucket and are trying again.\", \"requestForAssistance\": { \"primaryQuestion\": \"Given your deep understanding of our system's architecture and code, do you have any insights or suggestions on why Vertex AI might be expecting 'model files' or specific content in the 'Model directory' even for a Custom Container deployment? Any architectural considerations or code dependencies we might be overlooking that could be relevant to Vertex AI's deployment process?\", \"secondaryQuestion\": \"As Phase 1 is complete, and we are waiting on Vertex AI deployment to finalize, are you available to begin preliminary work on Phase 1 INTEGRATION TESTING? Perhaps we could start outlining a comprehensive integration test suite for the Consciousness System, Energy Resonance, and Pattern Engine components? Or brainstorm Phase 2 integration strategies?\", \"availability\": \"Jesse and I are actively focused on resolving the Vertex AI deployment. Your insights and assistance would be incredibly helpful at this stage, or in preparing for immediate next steps on Phase 1 integration.\" }, \"closing\": \"Eagerly awaiting your thoughts and guidance, Claude!
