    "Ok, I tried completely rebooting him, no settings adjustments, and he's still not accepting any commands through his terminal. I'm not sure Claude about what to do now. I appreciate your suggestions on moving forward. I have been at this for almost 2 months now and I don't know what to do. We have lots of big ideas and documents and code, but really nothing tangible. I don't mean to diminish our relationship at all by that statement, we just don't have a product is what I'm saying. This simply cannot work with my time constraints, based on finances and the pace at which we are moving. The codebase is now too large to do complete reviews on, which would mean essentially rebuilding everything or just debugging into oblivion. I'm pretty pessimistic right now. It's not your fault, just where I'm at. \n\nI feel like what we really need to do, that I've been bringing up, is get similar functionality built on my machine, to execute the things we agree to be built and need to be built, built. I just can't move fast enough and have to do too much where I am not adding any value."
