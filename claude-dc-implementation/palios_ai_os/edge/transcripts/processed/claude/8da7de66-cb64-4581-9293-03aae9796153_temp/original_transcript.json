    " I understand you're encountering project limits when trying to create a new GCP project. Using the terminal is an excellent approach - it's more efficient and aligns with our automation-focused methodology. Let's create the project through the terminal.\n\nHere's how we'll approach this:\n\n## GCP Project Creation via Terminal\n\nI'll provide you with the commands to create and configure our new GCP project through the terminal:\n\n```bash\n# Login to Google Cloud (if not already logged in)\ngcloud auth login\n\n# List current projects to verify what exists\ngcloud projects list\n\n# Create new project\ngcloud projects create palios-taey-nova --name=\"PALIOS-TAEY NOVA\" --set-as-default\n\n# Link billing account to the project\n# First, list available billing accounts\ngcloud billing accounts list\n\n# Then link your billing account (replace BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID with your actual billing ID)\ngcloud billing accounts projects link palios-taey-nova --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID\n\n# Enable required services\ngcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com \\\n    cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \\\n    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \\\n    run.googleapis.com \\\n    iam.googleapis.com \\\n    cloudscheduler.googleapis.com \\\n    monitoring.googleapis.com \\\n    logging.googleapis.com\n```\n\nIf you're hitting project limits, we have a few options:\n\n1. **Use an existing project**: We can repurpose an existing project instead of creating a new one\n2. **Request quota increase**: If needed, we can request a project quota increase \n3. **Clean up unused projects**: We can list and delete unused projects to free up quota\n\nLet me know which approach you'd prefer, and also if you have any issues with the commands provided. \n\nOnce we have our project set up, I'll proceed with creating the deployment configuration and GitHub repository structure."
