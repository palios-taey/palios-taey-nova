    " I see the issue now. The GitHub Actions authentication is failing because the GCP service account key is missing from the GitHub Secrets. Since the box is blank after you saved it, it appears the secret wasn't properly saved.\n\nThis is a common issue that can happen with large JSON keys. Let's fix this with a systematic approach:\n\n1. First, we need to check the service account key file you generated\n2. Then we'll properly add it to GitHub Secrets\n3. Finally, we'll update the workflow if needed\n\n## Step 1: Check the Service Account Key\n\nVerify that you have the JSON key file on your local machine (`github-actions-key.json` or similar). If you can't find it, we'll need to generate a new one.\n\n## Step 2: Add the Secret to GitHub\n\nThere are a few possible issues with adding the secret:\n- GitHub has size limits for secrets\n- Special characters might be causing problems\n- The JSON might need proper formatting\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1. Open the JSON key file in a text editor\n2. Make sure there are no extra spaces, newlines, or formatting issues\n3. Copy the entire content\n4. Go to GitHub repository \u2192 Settings \u2192 Secrets and variables \u2192 Actions\n5. Click \"New repository secret\"\n6. Name: `GCP_SA_KEY`\n7. Value: Paste the JSON key content (ensure it's the raw JSON with no extra formatting)\n8. Click \"Add secret\"\n\n## Step 3: Verify the Workflow\n\nOur workflow is already configured to use this secret. The specific line in the workflow is:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Authenticate to Google Cloud\n  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v1\n  with:\n    credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}\n```\n\nSince we're getting the error \"No authentication found for gcloud\", this confirms the secret isn't being found or is invalid.\n\nAfter adding the secret properly, let's trigger the workflow again by making a small change to the repository and pushing it. For example:\n\n```bash\n# Create a simple README update\necho \"# Deployment fix: $(date)\" >> README.md\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"Update README to trigger workflow\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nIf you're still having issues with GitHub Secrets, we can consider an alternative approach using Workload Identity Federation, which doesn't require storing a service account key.\n\nWould you like me to help you regenerate the service account key, or would you prefer to try the Workload Identity Federation approach?"
