    " I'm happy to help you narrow down the System76 Thelio options! Let me provide a specific configuration recommendation to use as your starting point.\n\n## System76 Thelio - Recommended Base Configuration\n\nStart with the **Thelio (thelio-r2)** model, which offers the best balance of performance and value.\n\n### Core Components:\n- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12-core/24-thread)\n- **Graphics**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8GB)\n- **Memory**: 64GB Dual-Channel DDR5 at 5600MHz (2 \u00d7 32GB)\n- **Boot Drive**: 1TB Samsung 990 Pro PCIe 4.0 NVMe\n- **Additional Storage**: 2TB Samsung 870 EVO SATA (or PCIe NVMe if within budget)\n- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Pop!_OS is also excellent if you prefer their UI)\n\n### Recommended Extras:\n- Enhanced cooling option if available\n- WiFi 6 if you'll be using wireless networking\n\nThis configuration should be very close to the $2000 budget while providing excellent performance for the Claude computer use beta and PALIOS-TAEY development.\n\nIf the price exceeds $2000, here are the components to adjust (in order of priority):\n1. Reduce additional storage to 1TB\n2. Step down to RTX 3060 or integrated graphics\n3. Reduce RAM to 32GB (least preferred compromise)\n\nThe Ryzen 9 7900X CPU is the most important component to keep, as it provides the core processing power we need for AI-driven development.\n\nWould you like me to help evaluate the final price once you've configured this on their website?"
