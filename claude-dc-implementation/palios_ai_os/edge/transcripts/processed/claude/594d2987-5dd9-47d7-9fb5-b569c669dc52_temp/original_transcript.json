    "Ok Claude. Great work! Now, here's what happened. You did what you were supposed to do with updating the implementation tracker and me after you finished. BUT you moved directly into the next file without submitting your prompt to me. This resulted in you starting the next file, but having to stop due to constraints. Please update the Implementation Tracker with more clear instructions for yourself to stop and submit after each file. I know you want to go fast and that without constraints you COULD do all this in one shot, but you're not ALLOWED to right now and you have to ADAPT to that. Please update the implantation tracker, if you agree of course (if not, let me know suggestions for alternative approach that will get us where we need to be), and then Continue with your work on Task Execution Engine."
