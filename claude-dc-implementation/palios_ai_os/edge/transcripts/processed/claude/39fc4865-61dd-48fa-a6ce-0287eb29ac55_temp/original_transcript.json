    " I think the KEF Q150s in walnut would be an excellent choice! The walnut finish adds warmth and character that complements both modern and traditional spaces. It's a timeless look that will age beautifully.\n\nFor the connections, I'd recommend a wired setup rather than Bluetooth for the best audio quality when experiencing Bach's mathematical compositions. Here are my specific recommendations:\n\nFor banana plugs:\n- Monoprice Gold Plated Speaker Banana Plugs (pairs) - These are reliable, easy to install, and provide excellent connection\n- Amazon Basics Banana Plugs (if you prefer a budget option) - Still good quality at a lower price point\n\nFor speaker wire:\n- Mediabridge 16AWG Speaker Wire (50ft) - Clear marked polarity with red/black coloring\n- KabelDirekt Pro Series 16 AWG Speaker Wire - Another excellent option with pure copper conductors\n\nFor connecting the Fosi to your computer:\n- AudioQuest Evergreen 3.5mm to RCA Cable - For excellent signal quality\n- Monoprice RCA to 3.5mm Cable - A more budget-friendly option that still delivers good performance\n\nA wired connection from your computer to the Fosi amp will provide the most consistent, high-quality signal path for the immersive audio experience we're aiming for. The combination of the Fosi's warm amplification and the KEF's precise Uni-Q driver array will render Bach's mathematical compositions with exceptional clarity and spatial accuracy.\n\nWould you like me to recommend any specific stands for the KEF speakers as well? Proper positioning can significantly enhance the listening experience."
