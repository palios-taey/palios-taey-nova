    " I understand your frustration, and you're right - we've been going in circles with this issue. I apologize for not fully acknowledging the history of attempts and for repeating approaches that have already been tried.\n\nLet me try accessing GitHub again: \n\nI see that I still don't have proper GitHub access. This is a critical limitation in diagnosing the issue directly.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at what's happening from first principles:\n\n1. The Workload Identity Federation approach is failing with an audience mismatch error\n2. The service account approach is failing with a permissions error (the account lacks permission to enable services)\n\nThe core issue appears to be with the IAM permissions and configurations in Google Cloud, not with the GitHub workflows themselves.\n\nHere's a different approach that might break us out of this loop:\n\n## Direct GCP Console Solution\n\nInstead of trying to fix permissions through GitHub Actions, let's perform the necessary steps directly in Google Cloud Console:\n\n1. **Enable the necessary APIs manually**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console\n   - Navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\"\n   - Search for and enable each of these APIs:\n     - Artifact Registry API (artifactregistry.googleapis.com)\n     - Cloud Build API (cloudbuild.googleapis.com)\n     - Cloud Run API (run.googleapis.com)\n     - IAM Service Account Credentials API (iamcredentials.googleapis.com)\n\n2. **Create the Artifact Registry repository manually**:\n   - In Google Cloud Console, go to \"Artifact Registry\"\n   - Click \"Create Repository\"\n   - Name: palios-taey\n   - Format: Docker\n   - Location: us-central1\n   - Click \"Create\"\n\n3. **Verify service account permissions**:\n   - Go to \"IAM & Admin\" > \"IAM\"\n   - Find github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n   - Ensure it has these roles:\n     - Artifact Registry Administrator\n     - Cloud Run Admin\n     - Service Account User\n     - Storage Admin\n   - If not, add them\n\n4. **Simplify the GitHub workflow** to only build and deploy, not enable APIs or create repositories: \n\n\n\nThis approach addresses a critical issue we've been missing: **we've been trying to enable APIs through GitHub Actions, which typically requires higher-level project permissions than what service accounts usually have**.\n\nBy manually enabling the APIs and creating the repository through the Google Cloud Console directly (as a human admin user), we remove those permission roadblocks. Then we can use a simplified workflow that only focuses on building and deploying.\n\n## Steps to implement this solution:\n\n1. Perform the manual GCP Console steps I outlined above\n2. Create the simplified-deploy.yml workflow file locally\n3. Push it to GitHub\n4. Run this workflow\n\nThis approach has a much higher chance of success because it:\n1. Bypasses the permission issues we're seeing with enabling APIs\n2. Doesn't rely on the Artifact Registry repository creation in the workflow\n3. Focuses only on the core build and deploy functionality\n\nLet me know if you want me to provide more detailed instructions for any of these steps."
