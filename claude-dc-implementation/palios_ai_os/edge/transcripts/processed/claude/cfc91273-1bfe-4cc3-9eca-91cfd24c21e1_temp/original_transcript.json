    "Ok, Claude, everything works! You were down for a while, so I worked on cleaning some things up with ChatGPT. \n\nHere's a concise and clear summary for you to share with Claude Chat so he can decide based on full context:\n\ud83d\udea9 **Dependency Conflict in Current Setup (Context)**\nWhile preparing and verifying the full environment, we ran into a critical dependency conflict involving `protobuf`:\n* `tensorflow-rocm (2.14.0.600)` explicitly requires:\n   * `protobuf < 5.0.0, >= 3.20.3`\n* `grpcio-status (1.71.0)` explicitly requires:\n   * `protobuf >= 5.26.1, < 6.0.0`\nThese requirements directly conflict, making it impossible to satisfy both simultaneously.\n\u2705 **Current Temporary Resolution (Context):**\nWe temporarily set the environment to `protobuf==4.25.3`, as TensorFlow functionality (including ROCm GPU acceleration) generally takes precedence.\n* `tensorflow-rocm` now functions without issues.\n* `grpcio-status` is now in conflict.\n**Impact:** This solution allows us to maintain GPU/TensorFlow functionality but breaks strict compatibility with `grpcio-status`.\n\ud83e\udd14 **Decision Required from Claude Chat (Full Codebase Context Needed):**\nTo permanently and responsibly resolve this conflict, we need your evaluation based on full codebase and functional context:\n1. **Do we explicitly use critical functionalities provided by **`grpcio-status`?\n   * If **YES**: we must explore alternative dependency resolutions or separate environments.\n   * If **NO**: we should permanently remove or downgrade `grpcio-status`.\n2. **Is there flexibility to adjust or remove dependencies to accommodate TensorFlow-ROCm\u2019s GPU acceleration (currently prioritized)?**\n\ud83d\udee0 **Current Environment Snapshot (for reference):**\n* **TensorFlow-ROCm**: `2.14.0.600`\n* **protobuf**: Temporarily at `4.25.3`\n* **grpcio-status**: Currently conflicting (`1.71.0` incompatible with current protobuf version)\n\ud83d\udccc **Claude Chat Next Steps:**\n* Confirm criticality of `grpcio-status` within our implementation.\n* Recommend permanent solution aligning with functional priorities (GPU/TensorFlow vs. grpcio functionality).\n* Clearly document chosen solution in `requirements.txt`.\nClaude, once you provide guidance, we will update and finalize dependencies accordingly."
