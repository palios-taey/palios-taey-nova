    " I understand your frustration with getting the cache to load into Claude DC (Claude Computer Use). Let me help you with specific, step-by-step instructions that should work reliably.\n\n## Loading Cache into Claude DC - Step by Step\n\n1. **Open a terminal window** in Claude DC's interface.\n\n2. **Use the proper command format**:\n   ```\n   cache load -b \"YOUR_CACHE_TEXT_HERE\"\n   ```\n\n3. **For large text (171K characters)**, you should split it into smaller chunks. Try loading 40-50K characters at a time with:\n   ```\n   cache load -a \"FIRST_CHUNK_HERE\"\n   cache load -a \"SECOND_CHUNK_HERE\"\n   ```\n   The `-a` flag appends to the existing cache rather than replacing it.\n\n4. **Verify the cache loaded** with:\n   ```\n   cache info\n   ```\n   This should show you the current size of your cache.\n\n5. **If you're still having issues**, try the temporary file approach:\n   ```\n   echo \"YOUR_CACHE_TEXT\" > temp_cache.txt\n   cache load -f temp_cache.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **After loading**, confirm with Claude DC that it has access to the information by asking a specific question about the cache content.\n\nThe most common issues are:\n- Not using quotes around the text\n- Trying to load too much at once\n- Special characters breaking the command\n- Not waiting for the cache to finish loading before sending new commands\n\nWould you like me to help troubleshoot any specific error messages you're seeing?"
