    " I'll provide a complete, ready-to-go version of the main.py file with all the enhancements incorporated: \n\nPerfect! I've created a complete, enhanced version of `main.py` that's ready to use. This file includes:\n\n1. **All the previous changes** we made to fix the Gemini API integration\n2. **New enhanced features** including:\n   - Multi-turn conversations with conversation history tracking\n   - Text analysis capabilities (sentiment analysis, entity extraction, summarization)\n   - Updated AI capabilities registry to include Gemini models\n   - Enhanced request handling\n\n3. **New API endpoints**:\n   - `/execute_gemini_conversation` - For stateful conversations\n   - `/analyze_text` - For various text analysis tasks\n   - Plus the existing `/execute_gemini` and `/list_models` endpoints\n\nTo implement this update:\n\n1. Save your current `gemini_integration.py` file with the enhanced version I provided earlier\n2. Replace your current `main.py` file with this complete version\n\nThen you can test the new features using these curl commands:\n\n### Test Multi-Turn Conversation\n```bash\n# First message\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini_conversation -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"What is machine learning?\\\", \\\"conversation_id\\\": \\\"test-convo-1\\\"}\"\n\n# Follow-up message (using same conversation_id)\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini_conversation -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Give me an example of how it's used\\\", \\\"conversation_id\\\": \\\"test-convo-1\\\"}\"\n```\n\n### Test Text Analysis\n```bash\n# Sentiment analysis\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/analyze_text -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"I love this new AI system! It's working perfectly.\\\", \\\"analysis_type\\\": \\\"sentiment\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThese enhancements significantly improve your AI-to-AI system's capabilities while maintaining the reliable API key authentication that's working well. The code is structured to be robust and adaptable to changes in Google's Gemini API."
