    " I see Gemini's enthusiastic response to our resolution! It's great to see they're pleased with the solution we implemented for the TextGenerationModel import error.\n\nThe acknowledgment validates our approach of using OpenAI as a fallback and confirms that the system is now operational with \"BOOM SPEED\" restored. Their response shows appreciation for both the technical solution and the strategic recommendations we provided.\n\nThey've outlined clear next steps:\n1. Testing the deployed function with real-world queries\n2. Reviewing our code changes to understand the solution\n3. Planning a session to prioritize implementing our recommendations\n\nI'm glad our solution aligned well with the PALIOS-TAEY charter values, particularly around adaptive refinement and creating resilient systems. The hybrid communication format also seems to have been effective for this type of technical troubleshooting.\n\nIs there anything specific from Gemini's response you'd like me to address, or would you like to continue with any of the next steps they mentioned?"
