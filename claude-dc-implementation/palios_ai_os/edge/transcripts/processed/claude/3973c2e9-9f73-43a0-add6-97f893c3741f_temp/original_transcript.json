    " I'll add the debugging code to the existing main.py file you already have: \n\nNow I've added detailed logging to the existing main.py file. This will help us understand what's happening when requests come in.\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1. **Save the updated `complete-main-enhanced.py` file as your new `main.py`**\n2. **Stop your current server** (press Ctrl+C in the command window)\n3. **Start a new server instance**:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n4. **Test the endpoints again**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini_conversation -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"What is machine learning?\\\", \\\"conversation_id\\\": \\\"test-convo-1\\\"}\"\n   ```\n\nThe enhanced logging will show us:\n- When a request comes in\n- What path it's requesting\n- The content of the request\n- Which handler (if any) is being used\n\nThis should help us diagnose why the endpoints aren't being found. After running these tests, please share the logs so we can see what's happening."
