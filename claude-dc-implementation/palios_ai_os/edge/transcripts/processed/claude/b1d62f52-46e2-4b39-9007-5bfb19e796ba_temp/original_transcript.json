    "Ok, here's where I'm at. I could not create the .github folder didn't create and I don't think I'm connected to my GitHub account in terminal yet. I tried doing the folder manually, but it wouldn't let me because of the '.'. I didn't see all the files you mentioned so not sure if they are contained in the deployment script or not. I've attached all code files from the previous chat for your review. My existing GitHub repository is deleted and is all clean."
