    " That's a great question! To fully implement this system, we should include verification strings in all Claude-to-Claude documents, not just the CTO onboarding document. However, we can take a pragmatic approach:\n\nThe most important documents to keep verified are:\n1. **CTO Onboarding Document** - This is the primary document for transitions\n2. **ATLAS Mission Briefs** - When delegating specific missions\n3. **Key Framework Documents** - That define critical systems\n\nFor day-to-day implementation, focusing on just updating the main document being referenced in the current transition is practical. So if CTO Claude is handing off a specific ATLAS mission, just updating that mission brief might be sufficient.\n\nThe command could be modified to update multiple key documents at once if needed:\n\n```bash\n# Update verification on multiple documents - copy entire box\n./scripts/documentation/update_verification.sh -f docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md -c CTO_MISSION_DEPLOYMENT_20250317\n./scripts/documentation/update_verification.sh -f docs/atlas-missions/deployment-mission.md -c CTO_MISSION_DEPLOYMENT_20250317\n```\n\nBut in practice, updating just the primary document being referenced in the current transition is usually sufficient and keeps things simple.\n\nDoes that make sense? We want the system to be effective but not burdensome for you to implement."
