    "Ok, got it. So I'd like to work with you to develop the next PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENT to implement all these. First, can you provide a guide for me on how to get what you would need for each connection and everything else you would need me to get prior to giving a prompt to execute? I don't want you to have to stop to get anything from me when executing this. \n\nAlso, how would you like to manage deployments going forward? Previously, you had wanted to automate through GitHub. Whatever you want is fine AI FIRST!"
