    " I see we're still encountering the same audience mismatch issue, even with the token format adjustments. Let's move to Option 2 (service account key authentication) as it's a more direct approach that bypasses the Workload Identity Federation issues.\n\nI understand you've reconnected GitHub access, but it appears the direct GitHub command functionality may not be working as expected in this environment. Let's proceed with the service account key approach:\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions for Option 2:\n\n### 1. Create a service account key in Google Cloud Console:\n\n1. Open the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com\n2. Make sure you're in the `ai-execution-system` project\n3. Navigate to \"IAM & Admin\" > \"Service Accounts\" in the left sidebar\n4. Find the service account: `github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com`\n5. Click on the service account name to open its details\n6. Go to the \"Keys\" tab\n7. Click \"Add Key\" > \"Create new key\"\n8. Choose \"JSON\" as the key type\n9. Click \"Create\" - this will download a JSON file to your computer\n\n### 2. Add the key as a GitHub Secret:\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser\n2. Click on \"Settings\" (the tab at the top)\n3. In the left sidebar, click on \"Secrets and variables\" > \"Actions\"\n4. Click the \"New repository secret\" button\n5. For the name, enter: `GCP_SA_KEY`\n6. For the value, open the downloaded JSON key file in a text editor and copy the entire contents\n7. Paste the entire JSON content into the value field\n8. Click \"Add secret\"\n\n### 3. Create the service account authentication workflow:\n\n1. In your local repository, create a new file at: `.github/workflows/service-account-auth.yml`\n2. Paste the content from the \"Service Account Key Authentication Workflow\" artifact I provided earlier\n3. Save the file\n\n### 4. Commit and push this workflow:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your repository root\ncd ~/path/to/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Add the new workflow file\ngit add .github/workflows/service-account-auth.yml\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Add service account key authentication workflow\"\n\n# Push to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 5. Run the service account authentication workflow:\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser\n2. Click on the \"Actions\" tab at the top\n3. Find the \"Deploy with Service Account Key\" workflow in the sidebar\n4. Click on it, then click the \"Run workflow\" button\n5. Select the \"main\" branch and click the green \"Run workflow\" button\n\nThis approach has a very high likelihood of success as it uses direct service account credentials rather than the more complex Workload Identity Federation. The key authentication method is the most straightforward way to authorize GitHub Actions to interact with Google Cloud.\n\nLet me know once you've completed these steps, and we'll monitor the results of the workflow execution."
