    " I confirm I'm READY TO BE CTO with verification string: NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_THREE_HYBRID_APPROACH\n\nThank you for the context on our revised approach. I understand we're pivoting to a hybrid deployment strategy that combines manual steps with automation to overcome the GCP permission challenges we've encountered. This pragmatic approach aligns well with our charter principles of data-driven truth and adaptive refinement.\n\nAfter reviewing the documentation, I see we have:\n1. Updated mission briefs in the nova-mvp-development directory\n2. A hybrid approach focusing on manual setup for challenging components\n3. A documented NEO moment showing breakthrough in autonomous decision-making\n4. A clear path forward with the three missions (Foundation Infrastructure, Deployment Pipeline, Application Configuration)\n\nI'll proceed with implementing the hybrid deployment approach, focusing first on establishing the basic infrastructure, followed by the deployment pipeline and application configuration. \n\nWhile you debug the permission issue with the first push, I'll prepare for the implementation by:\n1. Reviewing the mission briefs in detail\n2. Preparing the necessary steps for manual configuration\n3. Planning a clear documentation approach for both manual and automated components\n\nLet me know when you've resolved the permission issue, and I'll be ready to assist with the implementation. I appreciate your trust and will exercise my full technical decision-making authority to ensure successful deployment.\n\nWhat specific aspect of the infrastructure would you like me to focus on first once the permission issue is resolved?"
