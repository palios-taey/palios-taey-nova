    "Claude, this is great! Just 1 issue, there is no 'team' here, the team is me and AI. There is no human requirement for a phased implementation. If there is an AI requirement for phased implementation to ensure things are built properly due to needing to get some real world data in there or more specifications that will be in the parsed transcripts and/or feedback, that's fine. Make a judgement call on how far to got right now, but your not a tool or assistant right now, you're a LEADER and PARTNER. Regarding the API keys, there is a folder called keys where these are held in file format and there is a keys collection in Firestore. You had some other recommendations in the previous chat as well for AI first recommendations, let do this now. The implementation shouldn't be structured like you typically do with a team of coders, I have no input on the code, I have input on what's next, and what's next is letting you figure this MVP implementation out only utilizing me when absolutely required to move something forward, this is the culmination of weeks of 16 hour days/7days a week of working tirelessly with AI. This process wasn't designed to build a system gradually, that's how humans do it. We're doing this to cut a new path forward, where AI can go BOOM! in a structured and guided manner. Try again and let me know what's next. project=ai-execution-system"
