    " Ah yes, I see the issue. The error is in the `_decompose_task` method where we're trying to use `eval()` to parse GPT-4's response into a list of dictionaries. This is unreliable because GPT-4 might not return perfectly formatted Python syntax.\n\nLet's fix this by having GPT-4 return JSON instead, which we can parse more safely: \n\nKey changes:\n1. Explicitly request JSON format from GPT-4\n2. Use `json.loads()` instead of `eval()`\n3. Added better error reporting to see the raw response if parsing fails\n4. Made the schema requirements clearer in the prompt\n\nLet's run the test again:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThis should resolve the syntax error and give us proper task decomposition. Let me know what output you get."
