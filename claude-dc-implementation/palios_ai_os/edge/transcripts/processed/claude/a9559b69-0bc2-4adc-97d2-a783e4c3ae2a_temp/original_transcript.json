    " You're right, there are two issues to address:\n\n1. For the requirements file, yes, it's better to use the longer, updated requirements file we already have. You can replace the one in my instructions with your existing requirements.txt that has all the necessary dependencies.\n\n2. The GitHub authentication issue is because the Dockerfile is trying to clone from a repository that either doesn't exist or requires authentication. Let's modify the Dockerfile to skip the git clone and instead copy your local files directly:\n\n```bash\n# Edit the Dockerfile, replacing the git clone section with:\nsed -i 's/RUN git clone https:\\/\\/github.com\\/\\[YOUR_USERNAME\\]\\/palios-taey-nova.git ./# Skip git clone - we will copy files directly/' claude-dc-docker/Dockerfile\n\n# Add these lines after the directory structure creation:\necho '# Copy local code instead of git clone\nCOPY ./code/ /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/' >> claude-dc-docker/Dockerfile\n```\n\nNow you'll need to:\n1. Copy your local claude-dc-implementation files to claude-dc-docker/code/\n2. Rebuild the Docker image\n\nLet me know if you need more specific instructions for copying your local files."
