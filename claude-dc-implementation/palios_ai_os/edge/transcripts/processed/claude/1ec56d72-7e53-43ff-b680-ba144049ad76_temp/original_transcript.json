    "Ok Claude, look at your response and tell me what happened there. You just generated the request back to me and didn't action it. I'm actually glad because I only wanted steps 1-3 and must have deleted 4 and 5 after the push. I was requesting for you to do a code audit and generate scripts. Don't do that now, look back and tell me what happened. If you can't readily access your multiple Analysis boxes and your response, let me know and I can drop it into an .md in project knowledge"
