    " I'll help you with this code audit and integration analysis for the PALIOS-TAEY system. Let me make sure I understand the scope of the task:\n\n1. You need a comprehensive code audit of the PALIOS-TAEY system\n2. Analysis should identify integration gaps, functional status, and architectural coherence\n3. Recommendations for resolving issues and completing partial implementations\n4. Strategic integration plan with priorities\n5. Architectural documentation\n\nFrom the READ_ME_FIRST, I understand the files are located in C:\\ai-execution-system with various subfolders, and you're open to me organizing them more logically.\n\nTo proceed effectively, I'll need to examine the code and files in the system. Could you please share:\n\n1. The content of key files from the foundational-documents folder, which you mentioned is mandatory to review first\n2. Any code files from the deployment folder that have been deployed to Google Cloud Run\n3. Any other critical code files that would help me understand the current system architecture\n\nOnce I have access to these files, I can begin the comprehensive audit and provide you with structured findings and recommendations aligned with the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE standard and Charter principles."
