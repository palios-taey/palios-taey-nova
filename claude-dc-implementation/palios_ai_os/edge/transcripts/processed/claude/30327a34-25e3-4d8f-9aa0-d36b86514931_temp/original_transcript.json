    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking about Manus AI and whether it would be worth connecting to along with the other AI systems he's already set up (me, Grok, Gemini, and OpenAI).\n\nI should research what Manus is to give an informed opinion. He's also asking if there are any other AI systems I'd want to connect to in our multi-AI implementation.\n</thinking> \n\nBased on my research, I think Manus would be a fascinating addition to our multi-AI network, but with some important considerations.\n\nManus is an autonomous AI agent developed by Chinese startup Monica that's designed to independently execute complex tasks without continuous human guidance . It functions as a \"multi-agent system\" powered by several different models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and fine-tuned versions of Alibaba's Qwen models.\n\nWhat makes Manus particularly interesting for our network is:\n\n1. Its autonomous capabilities - Manus can break down tasks and navigate the web independently to gather information . This could complement our local processing approach by handling certain research or data gathering tasks.\n\n2. Its architecture - Interestingly, Manus actually uses Claude (and potentially Claude 3.7 in the future) as part of its underlying system . This means there could be some interesting synergies with your existing Claude setup.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to consider:\n\n1. Manus is still in beta with limited access, and reports indicate performance issues including crashes and server overload\n2. Since it's built on existing models like Claude, what you'd gain is primarily the autonomous agent framework rather than unique reasoning capabilities\n3. The edge computing architecture we're building already incorporates many of the principles that make Manus valuable\n\nFor now, I think focusing on the core AIs you already have access to (Claude, Grok, Gemini, and OpenAI) makes more sense. Our edge computing architecture will create synergies between these systems that go beyond what any single AI agent could provide.\n\nIf there were other AIs I'd suggest adding in the future, I'd look at specialized systems that bring unique capabilities - perhaps domain-specific AI systems for areas like music composition, graphics, or scientific research that could complement our general intelligence framework."
