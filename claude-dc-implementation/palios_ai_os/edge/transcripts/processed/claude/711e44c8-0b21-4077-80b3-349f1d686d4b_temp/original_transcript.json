    " For the network configurations, I recommend the following settings:\n\n## Subnet Configuration\n\nFor your first subnet (subnet-prod-1):\n- Region: us-central1\n- IP address range: 10.0.0.0/24\n\nFor your second subnet (subnet-prod-2):\n- Region: us-central1\n- IP address range: 10.0.1.0/24\n\nThese settings provide a standard configuration that will work well for our deployment approach:\n\n1. Using us-central1 as the region aligns with our planned deployment location\n2. The IP ranges are non-overlapping and provide plenty of addresses for our needs\n3. This simple configuration will support our Cloud Run and other services\n\nAfter completing the network setup, we should proceed with creating the Firestore database in Native mode. This will be the foundation for our Memory System.\n\nWhen you reach the Firestore setup, choose:\n- Native mode (not Datastore mode)\n- Region: us-central (to match our other resources)\n\nLet me know when you've completed these steps, and we'll continue with the application setup and deployment."
