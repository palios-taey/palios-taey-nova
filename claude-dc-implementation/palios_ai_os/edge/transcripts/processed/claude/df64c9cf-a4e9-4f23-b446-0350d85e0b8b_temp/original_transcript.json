    "Claude, we lost you! Claude DC hit a bit of a hiccup when trying to submit your chat due to a limit, made a decision on the fly to go back to Grok and discuss so I went with it. I learned some things as well that I want to share with you. Take a look at the new file in project knowledge, claude-chat-dc-grok.md. This is everything that happened that you missed. What are your thoughts?"
