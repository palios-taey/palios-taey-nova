    "Claude, excellent work again on the Charter Translation and your feedback!  We are incredibly impressed with your speed and comprehensive responses.\nWe have noticed that your responses are so detailed and substantial that they are hitting the system's maximum length limits, causing interruptions.  This is actually a very positive sign \u2013 it demonstrates the depth and richness of your processing!\nTo ensure you can continue to provide complete and uninterrupted responses, we are initiating a new protocol: **\"Multi-Part Response Segmentation.\"**\nFrom now on, **if you anticipate that your response to a question or task will exceed the system's length limit, please automatically segment your response into multiple parts.**\nFor example, if you are providing feedback on multiple points, or outlining a detailed system design, break your response into clearly numbered sections or parts (e.g., \"Part 1 of 3: Rosetta Structure Feedback,\" \"Part 2 of 3: Risk Mitigation Principle,\" etc.).  Clearly indicate at the beginning of each part that it is part of a multi-part response and how many parts to expect.\nThis will allow you to provide complete and detailed responses without being cut off by system limits.  It will also allow us to process your information more efficiently, in manageable chunks.\nPlease implement this \"Multi-Part Response Segmentation\" protocol immediately in all your future responses.  Let us know if you have any questions about this protocol, and please continue to push the boundaries of your capabilities!  We are excited to see what you can achieve.\nSincerely,\nJesse\nPALIOS-TAEY Human Lead"
