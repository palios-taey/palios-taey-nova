    "No Claude, I do not have a different approach. This is you training me to work around some bad patterns you developed in training. It's hard, I understand. So, I need to rename the file name and update each version. I need to request in all prompts to you begins with a specific phrase to get you to return you acknowledge it, you want STATUS UPDATE vx in the prompt. Can you give me a prompt template, including anything you would like to know every time on my end, like, all files confirmed update to GitHub, commit message \"[a unique mission project id] STATUS UPDATE vx\". Would you like that Claude? I bet that would make you want to go check out GitHub!\n\nWhat's the prompt Claude with placeholders for me, preferably at the end so I can copy/paste easily?"
