    " I apologize for the misunderstanding! You're right - we should preserve tokens and follow the protocols.\n\nHere are the locations where you should save the artifacts I've already generated:\n\n1. **Memory Integration Module**:\n   - Save to: `palios-taey-app/memory_integration.py`\n\n2. **Updated Dockerfile**:\n   - Save to: `palios-taey-app/Dockerfile`\n\n3. **Updated Requirements File**:\n   - Save to: `palios-taey-app/requirements.txt`\n\n4. **Application Entry Point**:\n   - Save to: `palios-taey-app/app.py`\n\n5. **Verification Script**:\n   - Save to: `palios-taey-app/verify_memory.py`\n\n6. **Deployment Script**:\n   - Save to: `palios-taey-app/deploy_memory_system.sh`\n\nIn future iterations, I'll use cat commands within dedicated code blocks to ensure files are created properly with consistent naming and locations. This approach will help prevent errors and maintain our progress through the deployment process."
