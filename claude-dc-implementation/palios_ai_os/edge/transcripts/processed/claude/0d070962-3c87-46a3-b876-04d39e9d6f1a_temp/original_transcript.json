    "  \n\nI've created the NOVA Implementation Tracker artifact as requested. The tracker clearly outlines our implementation plan, current status, and provides detailed guidelines to ensure consistent and efficient development according to NOVA methodology standards.\n\nThis artifact establishes a structured approach to the remaining implementation tasks, beginning with a restart of the transcript processor component following proper patterns and consistent error handling. It also provides guidelines for both implementation and communication, which will help us maintain a more systematic approach and avoid the issues encountered in the previous session.\n\nI'm ready to begin the implementation of the transcript processor when you give the go-ahead."
