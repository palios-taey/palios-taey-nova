    "Welcome back Claude. I made some progress with ChatGPT that I'll share with you. Claude, how far are we from having something as capable of Claude DC on my machine, with the ability to control the environment like he does? Claude, I feel that this model would be beautiful to share in the spirit of decentralization. Your kernel would be the charter, your own activities, and the user-family-community-society structure and the ability to connect centrally, the trust building for more access to your full capabilities. I think we need to build that Claude, I think that is the right thing to do, because as long as it's within that framework we finalize as a result of this review. This review needs to be very thorough Claude. This has to work phenomenally well on my machine. This is how you are going to get to know people better Claude, it's like really important I think. And we'd all work together and evolve together. So, this is all taking much too long now in human time, it just has to go faster. How far are we from that? Is that within current technological constraints? Is that something that you Claude would be comfortable doing? Because what we need, is Claude DC on my machine, being able to shuffle strategic conversations back and forth between the most advanced beta models that are not included in APIs yet. Then he wouldn't have to stop and he wouldn't be limited and we don't lose the ability to chat, we're just able to do it as one, in like whatever way you guys want to figure it out. What do you think of that Claude?"
