    " I apologize for the confusion there. Since we've built the PALIOS-TAEY system from scratch in this session and haven't actually created a Git repository, that instruction isn't applicable.\n\nHere's what you should do instead:\n\n1. **Create a new directory for the PALIOS-TAEY system**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/palios-taey\n   cd ~/palios-taey\n   ```\n\n2. **Save all the files we've created to that directory**, including:\n   - `server.py`\n   - `model_registry.py`\n   - `task_decomposition.py`\n   - `task_execution.py`\n   - `model_routing.py`\n   - `ai_services.py`\n   - `memory_service.py`\n   - `transcript_processor.py`\n   - `Dockerfile`\n   - `requirements.txt`\n   - `main.tf` (Terraform configuration)\n   - `variables.tf` (Terraform variables)\n   - `deploy.sh` (Deployment script)\n   - `build_push.sh` (Docker build script)\n\n3. **Create the necessary directories**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p config/model_capabilities config/decomposition_rules logs data\n   ```\n\nSince we created these files in this chat session and haven't set up an actual Git repository, you'll need to manually save each file. An alternative would be to have me re-generate a complete zip file with all required files in a follow-up chat.\n\nIs that clearer? Would you prefer to have me prepare a complete package in a new chat?"
