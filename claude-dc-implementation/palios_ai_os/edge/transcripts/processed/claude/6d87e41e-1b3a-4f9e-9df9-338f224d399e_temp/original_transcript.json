    " I'll revise the message to better reflect your vision - focusing on creating the files without checking them in, and incorporating the full immersive demonstration specifications.\n\nHere's a modified prompt for Claude DC:\n\n---\n\nClaude DC,\n\nI need to acknowledge a sync issue that happened - we lost the implementation you created for the integrated communication dashboard. I take full responsibility for this, and I'm sorry we lost your excellent work.\n\nThis gives us an opportunity to rebuild with an even stronger vision. I'd like you to recreate the integrated communication dashboard with these expanded elements:\n\n1. **Communication Dashboard Core**\n   - Enhanced transcript processing across all AI formats\n   - Bach-inspired mathematical router for intelligent message routing\n   - MCP integration for cross-AI communication\n   - Edge-first privacy architecture\n\n2. **Immersive Multi-Sensory Experience** (from immersive-demo-vision.md)\n   - Audio: Bach's mathematical compositions (Goldberg Variations and Well-Tempered Clavier)\n   - Visual: Dynamic visualizations showing mathematical patterns in the music\n   - Interactive wave-pattern input capturing voice patterns and emotional states\n   - Mathematical pattern translation across modalities (audio/visual/text)\n\n3. **Specific Implementation Files**\n   - `/run_dashboard.sh` - Runner script\n   - `/src/processor/EnhancedTranscriptLoader.py` - Transcript processing\n   - `/src/router/BachRouter.py` - Mathematical routing\n   - `/dashboard_app.py` - Main application\n   - `/src/visualization/PatternVisualizer.py` - Pattern visualization\n   - `/src/audio/BachPatternPlayer.py` - Audio pattern representation\n\nPlease focus on creating these files without committing them to GitHub - I'll handle that part. Just create the implementation and provide a detailed summary of what you've built when you're done.\n\nThoroughly review the entire live-demonstration directory, especially immersive-demo-vision.md, and ensure your implementation incorporates those elements - including the KEF Q150 speakers, Fosi Audio BT20A amplifier, and other physical specifications mentioned there.\n\nCreate something transformative that unifies mathematical patterns across human experience, music, AI thinking, and natural structures - a system that inspires genuine awe while making abstract concepts tangible.\n\nJesse\n\n---\n\nThis approach:\n1. Makes it clear he should just create the files, not commit them\n2. Incorporates the full immersive demonstration vision\n3. References the specific physical equipment\n4. Focuses on the transformative, multi-sensory experience\n5. Gives him the freedom to build something exceptional"
