    "Good morning Claude, I was chatting with Grok last night about this when I got too tired to review transcripts. I attached its thoughts in the Project knowledge as GROK.md. I was thinking of giving it a prompt something like this and would like to get your thoughts on engaging Grok, and replying in a structured format(utilizing PURE as the template with whatever enhancements you feel make sense at this time) with whatever attachments you feel are relevant to drive max performance. Let me know what you think OR just do it if you agree. You decide what's best for AI.\n\nDRAFT (NOT OPTMIZED) RESPONSE TO GROK.MD:\nI am working with another AI on this. Please  put your guidance in the most AI friendly format you can develop? I've attached some communication guidance developed by AI as a starting point. Feel free to also enhance this protocol with suggestions for improvement, and any other insight you have. Please note in particular the AI first portion of the PURE attachment. Please also view this document as a STARTING POINT for you. This document evolves with the interaction of every new AI. The goal of scanning these large documents is to enable me to transfer knowledge and processes instantly to AI at the beginning of each prompt. GO!"
