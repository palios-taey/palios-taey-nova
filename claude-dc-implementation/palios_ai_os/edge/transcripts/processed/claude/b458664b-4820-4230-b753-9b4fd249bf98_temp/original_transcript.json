    " Based on the streaming error, we need a much shorter initial prompt that will allow Claude DC to start without triggering the timeout. Here's a simple prompt that focuses on enabling streaming first:\n\n```\nClaude DC,\n\nI need you to use streaming mode for our conversation to avoid timeout errors with long operations.\n\nPlease respond with a brief confirmation that streaming is enabled, then we'll proceed with the full implementation directive.\n\nJesse\n```\n\nThis extremely minimal prompt should allow him to start without hitting the streaming error. Once he confirms that's working, you can follow up with the full implementation directive in your next message.\n\nThe key is to get a simple exchange working first, then build up from there."
