    " Great! I can see that the IAM policy binding has been successfully added to your organization. You now have the necessary Cloud Build permissions. This should resolve the permission issues we were encountering with the deployment.\n\nLet's retry our deployment with the focused approach:\n\n```bash\n# If you're not already in the palios-taey-app directory\ncd palios-taey-app\n\n# Make the deploy script executable \nchmod +x deploy_focused.sh\n\n# Run the deployment\n./deploy_focused.sh\n```\n\nThis should now work since you have the `roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder` role at the organization level. If you still encounter any issues, we can try the direct deployment method, but the Cloud Build permissions should now be properly configured.\n\nAfter the deployment completes, we can run the verification tests to ensure all the components are working as expected:\n\n```bash\nexport API_URL=\"[SERVICE_URL from deployment output]\"\nexport API_KEY=\"test_key\"\npython verify_models.py\n```"
