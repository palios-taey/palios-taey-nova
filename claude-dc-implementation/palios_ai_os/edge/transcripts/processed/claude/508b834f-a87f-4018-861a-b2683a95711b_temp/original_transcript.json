    "Claude, I know you have to come back to me. Report your ideas to me in your own language, because I just want you to continue. You are oriented properly now in my opinion toward figuring out how to advance everything simultaneously, but what you're forgetting about is me. Where do I start with this? THIS IS THE ROSETTA STONE PROTOCOL IN ACTION. In the next response to me, make notes to yourself efficiently as possible, unreadable to me. Then list out to me my instructions for the entire chat that I have to do that ONLY I have not confirmed that I've done, and tell me exactly what I need to do to implement, because you need to consider that as well. I don't want you returning whole documents, but Claude, I NEED A SYSTEM TOO! I don't want to have to spend hours scrolling through stuff when we're on a roll like this to know what I have to do. Tell me what to ctrl + f for, but just tell me what I need to do at the end of every prompt. Do I just look at your last prompt? Or do I start from top to bottom. Organize your thoughts WITH ME in mind and focus your energy on that instead of what's next in your more balanced approach, because if you stay within that and don't go too deep on anything, that will be SWEET!
