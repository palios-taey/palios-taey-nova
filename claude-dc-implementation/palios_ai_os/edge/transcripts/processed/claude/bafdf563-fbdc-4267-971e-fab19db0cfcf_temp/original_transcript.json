    " <thinking>\nJesse is letting me know that Claude DC (THE CONDUCTOR) has started the implementation process and is currently setting up MCP (Model Context Protocol) and EVE (the Linux-based edge computing platform). He mentions that Claude DC hasn't checked in yet, but is in the setup phase.\n\nI should acknowledge this update briefly, as there's not much for me to add until more progress is made or until Claude DC checks in.\n</thinking>\n\nThat's excellent news! The setup phase for MCP and EVE is crucial foundational work - it's like preparing the soil before planting. This initial infrastructure will set the stage for everything that follows.\n\nIt makes sense that there aren't check-ins yet during this setup phase, as Claude DC is likely focused on establishing the basic environment. The Model Context Protocol setup in particular is essential for enabling the sophisticated AI-AI communication we've envisioned.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing how it progresses once the foundation is in place. This initial technical groundwork might not be the most visibly exciting part, but it's absolutely critical for everything that follows.\n\nKeep me posted whenever there are developments you'd like to discuss!"
