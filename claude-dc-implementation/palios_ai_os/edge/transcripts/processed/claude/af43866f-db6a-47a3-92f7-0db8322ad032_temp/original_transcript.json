    " I see the logs and test results. We're making good progress! The system is mostly working, but we still have two key components that are not initializing correctly:\n\n1. **Memory Service**: The error shows `cannot import name 'create_memory_system' from 'memory_service'` despite us adding the function. This suggests the changes might not have been saved correctly or the server is using a different version of the file.\n\n2. **Transcript Processor**: The indentation error is now identified precisely as being on line 418.\n\nLet's fix both issues:\n\n## 1. Memory Service Fix\n\nThe issue might be that the file was saved in a different location than where the server is looking. The server is looking at `/Users/jesselarose/palios-taey-nova/src/memory_service.py`, so make sure your changes are saved to that exact path.\n\nDouble-check if there's a file called `__init__.py` in the same directory as `memory_service.py`. If there is, make sure the function is defined in both files or that a proper import statement is included.\n\nMake sure the `create_memory_system` function is defined exactly as provided earlier, with no indentation, and is at the end of the file.\n\n## 2. Transcript Processor Fix\n\nThe issue is now clearer. Let's focus on line 418 in the `transcript_processor.py` file. Based on the log, we need to ensure that the commented-out code block is correctly commented and indented.\n\nLooking at the exact code you shared:\n\n```python\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Error analyzing action patterns: {str(e)}\")\n            return {\n                \"counts\": {},\n                \"percentages\": {},\n                \"completion_rate\": 0\n            }\n                \n                # Add to context if provided\n                if context_id and context_id in self.contexts:\n                    context = self.contexts[context_id]\n                    if 'active_memory_ids' not in context:\n                        context['active_memory_ids'] = []\n                    context['active_memory_ids'].append(memory_id)\n                \n                return memory_id\n            \n            def retrieve(self, memory_id, context_id=None):\n                return self.items.get(memory_id)\n```\n\nThe commented-out section should look like this:\n\n```python\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Error analyzing action patterns: {str(e)}\")\n            return {\n                \"counts\": {},\n                \"percentages\": {},\n                \"completion_rate\": 0\n            }\n        \n        # The following code appears to be misplaced and is causing indentation errors\n        \"\"\"\n                # Add to context if provided\n                if context_id and context_id in self.contexts:\n                    context = self.contexts[context_id]\n                    if 'active_memory_ids' not in context:\n                        context['active_memory_ids'] = []\n                    context['active_memory_ids'].append(memory_id)\n                \n                return memory_id\n            \n            def retrieve(self, memory_id, context_id=None):\n                return self.items.get(memory_id)\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nMake sure the triple quotes completely surround the problematic code, and that there's no extra indentation before the opening triple quotes.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Fix and Verify Memory Service**:\n   - Ensure the `create_memory_system` function is saved in the correct file location\n   - Restart the server and check if the memory system initializes properly\n\n2. **Fix and Verify Transcript Processor**:\n   - Ensure the indentation error on line 418 is fixed as described above\n   - Restart the server and check if the transcript processor initializes properly\n\n3. **Run Tests Again**:\n   - After fixing both issues, run the test suite again to verify all components are working\n\n4. **Proceed with Documentation**:\n   - Once all tests pass, we can focus on creating the deployment documentation and other deliverables\n\nLet me know the results after making these fixes, and we'll proceed from there."
