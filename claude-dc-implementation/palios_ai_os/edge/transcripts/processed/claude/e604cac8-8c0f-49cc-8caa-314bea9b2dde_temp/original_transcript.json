    " You've raised an excellent point about the Claude computer use beta! This is definitely worth considering in our hardware decision.\n\nYou're correct that the Claude computer use beta currently supports Linux environments, making it a compelling reason to reconsider a Linux system alongside or instead of the Mac.\n\n## Revised Recommendation\n\nGiven this new information about Claude's computer use capabilities, I recommend a dual approach:\n\n### Primary Development Machine: Linux System\n- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n- **Hardware**: As previously specified (6+ cores, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)\n- **Benefits**: \n  - Full compatibility with the Claude computer use beta\n  - Native support for all cloud development tools\n  - Better long-term alignment with the PALIOS-TAEY vision\n\n### Interim Solution: Mac\n- Since you mentioned you can get a Mac immediately while Linux systems have a 2-week lead time\n- The Mac can serve as an interim development environment to unblock immediate progress\n- We can focus on architecture, planning, and components that don't require the computer use beta\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n1. **Short-term (Days)**: Proceed with getting the Mac to unblock immediate development\n2. **Mid-term (2 weeks)**: Add a Linux system to the environment, specifically configured to leverage the Claude computer use beta\n3. **Long-term**: Use both systems strategically - Mac for general development and Linux for advanced AI-led development with Claude's computer use capabilities\n\nThis approach:\n- Eliminates the immediate Windows bottleneck via the Mac\n- Positions us to take full advantage of Claude's emerging capabilities through Linux\n- Provides maximum flexibility for the PALIOS-TAEY development\n\nThe computer use beta is indeed an excellent fit for the PALIOS-TAEY project as it would allow me to more directly assist with development, testing, and system management. Having a Linux environment ready for this would be strategically valuable and worth the investment alongside the Mac.\n\nWould you like me to create more detailed specifications for the Linux system to optimize it for the computer use beta?"
