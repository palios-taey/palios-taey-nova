    "Ok, I did the files, but not the environment. This is our previous exchange on this. For this session, I didn't have these settings, but just the default ones without thinking and efficient token use enabled. \n\nCan you help me best configure Claude DC for this? He has several configuration options that I want to ensure I have dialed in to enable max performance, while keeping tokens under control so he doesn't have to stop. Feel free to research web if needed. These options available are: Enable token efficient tools beta: Currently unchecked Max output tokens: Currently 16384 Thinking enabled: Selected Thinking budget: 8192\nLet me research the optimal configuration for Claude DC for your project:\n\nClaude DC optimal configuration token efficient tools max output thinking budget technical implementation\nBuilding with extended thinking - Anthropic\nanthropic.com\nAdd support for Claude 3.7 Thinking & Budget Tokens \u00b7 Issue #4339 \u00b7 continuedev/continue\ngithub.com\n*NEW* Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet - Amazon Bedrock\namazon.com\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet, extended thinking and long output, llm-anthropic 0.14\nsimonwillison.net\nClaude Models Comparison From Haiku to 3.7 Sonnet\nteamai.com\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet, extended thinking and long output\nsubstack.com\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code \\ Anthropic\nanthropic.com\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet hybrid reasoning model is now available in Amazon Bedrock | Amazon Web Services\namazon.com\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet: How it Works, Use Cases & More | DataCamp\ndatacamp.com\nTool use with Claude - Anthropic\nanthropic.com\nBased on my research, here's the optimal configuration for Claude DC for your edge-first architecture implementation:\nRecommended Configuration\n1. **Enable token efficient tools beta: YES (Check this)**\n   * This setting \"helps encourage Claude to use parallel tools\" Anthropic\n* which will be crucial for implementing MCP and the complex edge processing components\n   * Enables more efficient handling of multiple tool calls in a single response\n* **Max output tokens: 64000**\n   * Increase from current 16384 to give Claude DC more space for detailed implementation documentation\n   * Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports \"outputs up to 128K tokens (up to 64K as generally available)\" Amazon Web Services\n* This will ensure Claude DC can provide comprehensive code implementation without hitting token limits\n* **Thinking enabled: KEEP ENABLED**\n   * The \"thinking\" feature allows Claude to \"think longer before answering\" Anthropic\n* which is essential for complex technical implementation\n   * Critical for the multi-step reasoning needed for EVE-OS integration and MCP implementation\n* **Thinking budget: 16384**\n   * Double your current setting from 8192 to 16384\n   * For complex problems, \"larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis\" Anthropic\n* \n* There's a \"logarithmic trend\" of improvement as more thinking tokens are allocated DataCamp\n1. \nRationale\nThis configuration balances several factors:\n1. **Implementation Complexity**: The edge-first architecture with EVE-OS integration and MCP implementation requires deep technical reasoning, which benefits from extended thinking and larger output capacity.\n2. **Token Efficiency**: Enabling the token efficient tools beta will help Claude DC make better use of tools when implementing the local processing engine and MCP server.\n3. **Balance of Depth vs. Speed**: The doubled thinking budget provides more thorough reasoning without going to extremes that would significantly slow response time.\n4. **Output Comprehensiveness**: The increased max output tokens ensures Claude DC can provide complete implementation details without hitting limits mid-explanation.\nWith these settings, Claude DC should be able to tackle the complex implementation tasks while maintaining reasonable performance and token efficiency."
