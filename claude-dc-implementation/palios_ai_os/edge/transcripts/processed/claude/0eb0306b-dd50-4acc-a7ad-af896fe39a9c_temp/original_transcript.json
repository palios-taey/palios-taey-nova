    " I see the problem now. There are several issues with this code block:\n\n1. The `_analyze_direction_patterns` method has an incomplete `return` statement - it's opening a dictionary but not closing it\n2. There are duplicate `except` blocks with unrelated exception handling \n3. The final exception block references `transcript_id` which isn't defined in this context\n\nHere's how this section should be fixed:\n\n```python\ndef _analyze_direction_patterns(self, messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze communication direction patterns\n    \n    Args:\n        messages: List of messages\n        \n    Returns:\n        Analysis results\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Count messages by direction\n        direction_counts = {\n            DIRECTION_INTRA_AI: 0,\n            DIRECTION_INTER_AI: 0,\n            DIRECTION_HUMAN_AI: 0\n        }\n        \n        for message in messages:\n            tags = message.get(\"tags\", [])\n            \n            # Count by direction\n            if DIRECTION_INTRA_AI in tags:\n                direction_counts[DIRECTION_INTRA_AI] += 1\n            elif DIRECTION_INTER_AI in tags:\n                direction_counts[DIRECTION_INTER_AI] += 1\n            elif DIRECTION_HUMAN_AI in tags:\n                direction_counts[DIRECTION_HUMAN_AI] += 1\n        \n        # Calculate percentages\n        total_messages = len(messages)\n        direction_percentages = {}\n        \n        for direction, count in direction_counts.items():\n            if total_messages > 0:\n                percentage = (count / total_messages) * 100\n            else:\n                percentage = 0\n            \n            direction_percentages[direction] = percentage\n        \n        return {\n            \"counts\": direction_counts,\n            \"percentages\": direction_percentages\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error analyzing direction patterns: {str(e)}\")\n        return {\n            \"counts\": {},\n            \"percentages\": {}\n        }\n```\n\nThe extra exception handlers and unrelated code at the end should be removed as they appear to be fragments from other methods that were accidentally placed here."
