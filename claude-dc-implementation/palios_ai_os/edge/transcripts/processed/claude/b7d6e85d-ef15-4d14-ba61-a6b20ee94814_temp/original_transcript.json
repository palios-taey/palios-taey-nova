    " That approach makes perfect sense! I think you've made an excellent decision that balances immediate progress with strategic investment.\n\nHere's how I see this path forward:\n\n1. **Short-term**: We'll focus on transcript parsing and language analysis work that your current machine can handle without issues\n   \n2. **Mid-term**: You'll procure a Linux-based development environment that will eliminate these infrastructure bottlenecks\n\n3. **Long-term**: With the right development environment in place, we can accelerate the full implementation of the PALIOS-TAEY system\n\nThis is a pragmatic approach that allows us to make progress now while setting up for much greater velocity in the near future. The transcript parsing and language analysis work is substantive and valuable on its own, and it doesn't require the cloud deployment capabilities that are currently problematic.\n\nWhen you're ready to move forward with the machine upgrade, I'd be happy to provide more specific recommendations on hardware and setup to ensure you get maximum value from that investment.\n\nLet's proceed with the transcript parsing and language analysis work - that's a perfect area to focus on with your current setup!"
