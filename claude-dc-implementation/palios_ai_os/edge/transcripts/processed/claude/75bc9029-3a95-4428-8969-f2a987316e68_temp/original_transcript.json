    "Great to have you on as the very first BREAKOUT CTO. We uncovered this in the last chat session and were super excited to get this over to you!\n\nFirst, here is your access to GitHub: /github palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\nThis is the error message in the workflow detail. If there is somewhere else to look for more details, let me know: Annotations\n1 error\n**deploy**\nbuildx failed with: Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/build-cache-backends/\n\nThe current deploy.sh file is attached. I also attached the current Dockerfile in the root directory since it was mentioned in the error. Feel free to check GitHub directly for any additional files you need, or I'm happy to provide in the chat or Project knowledge if you're having issues. What's next? Let's see if this works!"
