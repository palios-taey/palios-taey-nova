    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking if he just needs to put his webhook secret key in Claude DC's cache so Claude DC will know how to authenticate with the webhook server. This is a good question about the implementation.\n</thinking>\n\nYes, exactly! You need to add the SECRET_KEY to Claude DC's knowledge cache. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ncat > ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/current-execution-status/webhook-credentials.md << 'EOF'\n# Webhook Server Credentials\n\n## Authentication Details\n- SECRET_KEY: \"secure_webhook_key_here\"  # Replace with your actual key\n- WEBHOOK_URL: \"http://localhost:8000/webhook\"\n- BASE_DIR: \"/home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova\"\n\n## Connection Parameters\n- Server is running on port 8000\n- Expects X-Claude-Signature header with HMAC-SHA256 signature\n- All requests should be sent as JSON with Content-Type: application/json\n\nClaude DC should use these credentials to authenticate all webhook requests following the protocol described in webhook-integration-instructions.md.\nEOF\n```\n\nMake sure to replace \"secure_webhook_key_here\" with the actual secret key you used in the webhook_server.py file.\n\nThen include this file in the next update to Claude DC's cache. This way, Claude DC will have all the necessary credentials to authenticate with the webhook server.\n\nThis approach keeps the secret key in a separate file for security reasons, making it easier to manage if you need to rotate keys in the future.\n\nGreat job setting everything up! This webhook server will allow Claude DC to work continuously without manual intervention, significantly accelerating the implementation process."
