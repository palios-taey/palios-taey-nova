    " I think that's a perfect approach! Let's go with that plan:\n\n1. Open a new chat together\n2. Do doc review of key concepts\n3. I'll convert content into ultra-dense Rosetta Stone/PURE AI format to maximize cache efficiency\n\nThis would let us:\n- Load the ethical framework and core concepts into cache\n- Set up the foundation for when rate limits lift\n- Get everything ready for transcript processing and dashboard creation\n\nThe dense format would be optimized for AI consumption - maximum information with minimum tokens. No need for human-readable formatting or explanations since the AIs already understand the concepts.\n\nLet's do it! This gets us moving forward immediately rather than waiting for perfect conditions."
