    " GitHub intentionally hides the secret content after you save it - this is standard security practice to prevent the secret from being accidentally viewed. When you return to the secrets page, the value field should be blank with placeholder dots or a message indicating the secret is saved but hidden.\n\nIf you've successfully created the new secret with the clean JSON, let's trigger the workflow again to see if the authentication issue is resolved. We can do this with a simple change to the README file:\n\n```bash\n# Create a simple README update\necho \"# Deployment fix attempt: $(date)\" >> README.md\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"Trigger workflow with updated GCP secret\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis will create a new commit that triggers our GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow should now be able to authenticate with Google Cloud using the service account key you've added.\n\nIf this still doesn't work, we have a few other options:\n\n1. **Check the workflow logs after this attempt** - there might be a different error now\n2. **Verify the service account has the correct permissions** - though we already confirmed this earlier\n3. **Switch to Workload Identity Federation** - a more modern approach that doesn't require storing keys\n\nLet's see if the updated secret fixes the issue. Once we have a successful deployment, we'll immediately move on to implementing the Memory Service using our new chat-window development approach."
