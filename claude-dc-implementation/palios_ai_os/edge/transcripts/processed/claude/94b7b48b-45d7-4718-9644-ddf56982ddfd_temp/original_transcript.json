    "Glad you like the onboarding process. It was many hours of work over many chats, tailored just to you Claude! You're in charge, just make sure to stay within scope. Focus on the TRUTH in code is absolutely imperative as debugging is extremely time consuming and costly. Remember to return everything with the 6SIGMA quality checks and note anything that is uncertain so we can address. And don't forget about the processes that minimize human labor and errors. Let's go!"
