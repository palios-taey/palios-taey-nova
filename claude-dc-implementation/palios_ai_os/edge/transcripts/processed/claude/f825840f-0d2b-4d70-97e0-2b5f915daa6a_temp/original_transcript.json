    " Let's use the `-reconfigure` flag to force Terraform to reinitialize:\n\n```bash\nterraform init -reconfigure -backend=false\n```\n\nThis will discard any existing backend configuration and reinitialize Terraform using the current configuration files.\n\nIf we're still seeing the backend initialization error, there might be a leftover backend configuration in one of your Terraform files that we haven't addressed. Let's search for any remaining backend references:\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"backend\" --include=\"*.tf\" .\n```\n\nThis will show if there are any backend configurations still present in your Terraform files. If found, we'll need to comment out or remove those references.\n\nLet's take a methodical approach to solving this once and for all."
