    "  \n\nI've completed the main.py implementation from where it left off. Here's what I've added:\n\n1. **Memory Context Management Endpoints**\n   - Added `/memory/add_to_context/<memory_id>/<context_id>` endpoint to add memory items to contexts\n   - Added `/memory/remove_from_context/<memory_id>/<context_id>` endpoint for removing memory items from contexts\n\n2. **Memory Item Management Endpoints**\n   - Added `/memory/update/<memory_id>` endpoint for updating memory items\n   - Added `/memory/forget/<memory_id>` endpoint for removing or archiving memory items\n\n3. **Task Management Endpoints**\n   - Added `/task/decompose` endpoint for task decomposition\n   - Added `/task/cancel/<task_id>` endpoint for canceling tasks\n   - Added `/task/active` endpoint to list active tasks\n\n4. **System Management Endpoints**\n   - Added `/system/shutdown` endpoint for graceful system shutdown\n   - Added `/system/status` endpoint for detailed system status\n\n5. **Main Function**\n   - Completed the main entry point with argument parsing\n   - Added proper error handling throughout\n   - Implemented startup and configuration handling\n\nAll added endpoints follow the same robust error handling pattern established in the existing code, with consistent status reporting and appropriate HTTP status codes. The implementation maintains graceful degradation when components are not available, ensuring the system remains operational even when parts are failing."
