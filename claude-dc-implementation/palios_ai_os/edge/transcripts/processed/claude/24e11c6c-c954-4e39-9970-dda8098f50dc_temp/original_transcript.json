    "Thank you again Claude. I see your recommendation to use Functions. However, it appears to be an inferior solution. Given your capabilities, what is the difference in human time required to implement both solutions? You can estimate and use a multiple of some sort, like, Cloud Functions will take 2 human hours and Run is likely to be x times that. Also, what would be the impact from transitioning from Functions to Run? Lastly, since this is an AI designed and built system for AI and Humanity, what would your decision be if not constrained by a rush to build an MVP?"
