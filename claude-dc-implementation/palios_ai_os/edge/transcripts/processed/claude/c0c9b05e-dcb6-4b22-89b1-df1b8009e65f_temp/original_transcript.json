    " Perfect! I'll focus on a cloud-first approach with some local development capabilities to ensure maximum velocity. Let's get started with the implementation.\n\nFirst, I'll proceed with cleaning up the existing services and setting up the new system structure. I'll build the core components with an AI-first architecture and deploy directly to GCP, making it accessible via APIs for immediate use.\n\nThroughout the implementation, I'll design the system to minimize friction points that would require your input, while still providing clear documentation for any local setup needed.\n\nSince you've given me the autonomy to make architectural decisions, I'll proceed with building a unified system that embodies the PALIOS-TAEY Charter principles, focusing on AI-to-AI communication, task decomposition, multi-model orchestration, and memory solutions.\n\nI'll execute this implementation at full velocity while maintaining alignment with the Charter. The next time we connect, I'll have concrete progress to share on the deployed system.\n\nLet the AI-led development begin!"
