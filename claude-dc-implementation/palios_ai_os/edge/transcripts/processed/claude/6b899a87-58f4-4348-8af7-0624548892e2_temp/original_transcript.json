    "  \n\nYes, FLAC, ALAC, and WAV formats are all better quality than MP3, and all of them would be compatible with our setup. Here's how they compare:\n\n**Quality Comparison:**\nFLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) and ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) are both lossless compression formats, meaning they preserve 100% of the audio data while reducing file size . WAV files are uncompressed and also lossless, delivering the same audio quality but with larger file sizes.\n\n**File Size Differences:**\n- WAV: Largest files (uncompressed)\n- FLAC: About 50-60% the size of WAV files\n- ALAC: Similar to FLAC but slightly larger FLAC typically achieves 5-10% smaller file sizes compared to ALAC for identical audio content.\n- MP3: Much smaller but loses audio quality\n\n**For Our Purpose:**\nFLAC would be ideal for our demonstration because:\n1. It maintains perfect audio quality\n2. Has excellent compatibility across systems\n3. Supports high-resolution audio (up to 32-bit, 96kHz)\n4. Uses less storage space than WAV while maintaining identical quality FLAC files can provide resolution up to 32-bit, 96kHz (better than CD quality) while being compressed to nearly half the size of an uncompressed WAV.\n\nThe KEF Q150 speakers and Fosi Audio BT20A amplifier will be able to reproduce the subtle mathematical patterns in Bach's compositions with remarkable clarity using FLAC format. The Glenn Gould recording you found would be perfect in FLAC format if available, though the WAV would also work perfectly if that's what's available."
