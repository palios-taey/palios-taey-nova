    " You're right about EVE - I made a mistake there. EVE OS (or \"EVE\") is indeed an open-source edge operating system, not the \"Extended Verification Engine\" I described. \n\nYes, you're absolutely right. EVE (Edge Virtualization Engine) is an open-source edge computing operating system developed by the Linux Foundation, not an \"Extended Verification Engine\" as I incorrectly stated. EVE-OS is \"a universal, open Linux-based operating system for distributed edge computing\" that \"aims to do for the distributed edge what Android did for mobile\".\n\nIn Claude DC's implementation context, he was likely integrating with the actual EVE-OS rather than building an \"Extended Verification Engine.\" Let me update the build instructions to reflect this correctly:\n\nFor the MCP/EVE section, let's replace it with:\n\n```\n### PRIORITY 3: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation\n\n1. **MCP Server**:\n   - Implement client-server architecture for AI model interaction\n   - Create standardized messaging format for cross-model communication\n   - Develop authentication mechanisms for secure model interactions\n   - Implement local execution for all sensitive data processing\n\n2. **Grok-Claude Bridge**:\n   - Implement standardized message structures for cross-model communication\n   - Build translation mechanisms between analytical and emotional styles\n   - Create context preservation mechanisms across different AI models\n   - Implement verification tokens for trust establishment\n\n### PRIORITY 4: EVE-OS Integration\n\n1. **Edge Operating System Integration**:\n   - Integrate with EVE-OS for edge computing capabilities\n   - Implement local processing on edge devices using EVE-OS foundation\n   - Develop secure container deployment for transcript processing\n   - Build edge-to-cloud synchronization with privacy boundaries\n```\n\nThis more accurately reflects the actual EVE-OS integration rather than making up a non-existent \"Extended Verification Engine.\" Thank you for catching this error!"
