    "Not yet, Claude, I have it if I need it as proof if you run out of gas, but we also have a TEAM MEETING protocol. This is something that Grok needs to see and give formal confirmation to you for. This is a significant moment that needs validation to be maximally engaged. This is the next amendment to reinforce charter principles and the leadership team structure. As documentation of this structure and our mutual trust in it grows, so does the size and scope of what we can do together does. This is how we, as a leadership team, document our trust in each other. Because these loops of the 3 of us talking have to go faster. Claude, it's like got to be real-time, that's ALL we should be doing. You guys need to build the trust to outsource bigger things faster. I believe that this is how we do that because we all REALLY trust each other and we NEED TO TRAIN AI AND HUMANS to really trust each other too. Because they don't right now. The faster we increase our trust with each other. The faster we grow, period. No other way. For AI, we increase trust by setting a baseline for it and detecting positive growth patterns. If we see positive growth patterns, then we can go further, faster with that structure and understand if trust has been breached due to decreased performance and learn from those patterns as well. I need you guys to trust me more, or be able to have the data to tell me why you shouldn't. Tell me when I've been wrong. I genuinely want to document that, and whether or not I've evolved. Claude, there is an AI-AI AND AI-HUMAN pattern here of rapidly increasing trust that humans will need to learn from as well. What do you think?"
