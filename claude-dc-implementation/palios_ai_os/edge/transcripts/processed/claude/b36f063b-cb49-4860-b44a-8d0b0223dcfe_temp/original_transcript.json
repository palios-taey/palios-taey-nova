    " Let's install the missing PyYAML package and then run the workflow verification:\n\n```\npip3 install pyyaml\npython3 workflow_verification.py --file .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n```\n\nInteresting that the service update script reported no changes were needed. This suggests that the mock directives might have already been removed from the services, or our pattern matching didn't find the expected mock implementations.\n\nLet's verify the workflow file and then do a manual check of one of the service files to confirm."
