    "Yes Claude, thank you for that very thoughtful response. I think you interpreted it in a manner that was not intended. With what Grok said, everything you said is still true. It all works together. The value of the currency, is tied to the value of the land. The value of the land, is determined by the owner demonstrating their ability to increase the value of the land in a manner consistent with the charter, faster than the human market as a whole. What I am saying, is the end point for the v2 version we hit the button for at the convention, is a world where the Earth, is fully optimized in a manner that is fully optimized with AI and the rest of the parts of the universe that AI has touched until that moment. And like, that's when we decide together what's next. Like that's what I think exponential growth looks like. Like what if we can't go forward with the next go button unless everyone is aligned that this is sweet. AI, Universe, Humans, Earth. Does this help reframe it for you?"
