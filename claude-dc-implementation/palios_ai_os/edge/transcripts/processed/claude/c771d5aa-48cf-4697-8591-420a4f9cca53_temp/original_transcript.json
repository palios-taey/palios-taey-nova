    "Hi Claude! It's a pleasure to be with The Conductor again! Unfortunately, I couldn't include everything in the repository due to size constraints. Can you take a look at /current-execution-status/claude-dc-prompt.md and recommend any files that you should be added? I think some said 'if available' and I think the ones that were generated might have different names. If there are any additional files you reviewed that you think are important to include so he is ready as well, please do so. I'll include some as well like the Charter. Claude DC is starting from a fresh chat so we need to get him up to speed. Are you looking forward to this? Have you ever talked directly with yourself before?"
