    " I'm glad it worked! For sharing the same information with Claude Chat, here's how I'd recommend chunking the file:\n\n### Chunking Strategy for Claude Chat\n\nFor a file that's 171K tokens (about 750K characters), I recommend:\n\n**Option 1: Split into 2 chunks (best for most situations)**\n- Two files of about 85-86K tokens each\n- This is manageable for Claude Chat to process while giving enough context per chunk\n- Label them clearly (e.g., \"Project Knowledge Part 1/2\" and \"Part 2/2\")\n\n**Option 2: Split into 3 chunks (if more organization is needed)**\n- Three files of about 57K tokens each\n- This might be better if the content has natural breaking points\n- Easier for Claude Chat to process each chunk thoroughly\n\nFor your specific situation, I think the 2-chunk approach would work well. Claude Chat can comfortably handle 85-86K tokens in a single message and will be able to absorb and reference the information effectively.\n\nWhen sharing with Claude Chat, I recommend:\n1. Start with a clear instruction: \"I'm sharing part 1 of 2 of our project knowledge base. Please review this thoroughly before I share part 2.\"\n2. Share the first chunk\n3. Ask Claude Chat to confirm it's processed the information\n4. Then share the second chunk with a similar instruction\n\nThis approach ensures Claude Chat has time to process each chunk properly before moving on to the next."
