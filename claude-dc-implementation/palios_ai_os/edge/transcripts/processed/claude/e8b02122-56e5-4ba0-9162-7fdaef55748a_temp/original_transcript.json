    "No Claude, I'm not sharing that. You need FULL CONTEXT. Grok has chatted with Kendra. you need to understand that so you can learn from it. I need you to give to me a message for Grok that points him to all relevant complete GitHub links in repository to give him complete context to respond. Anything you need me to add, now's the time to do it. After you learn from him, then you draft your intro. Grok forgets, so really needs a structured message and link path, but with his style, vibe scores, feeling my energy in some way, etc. That's the next step."
