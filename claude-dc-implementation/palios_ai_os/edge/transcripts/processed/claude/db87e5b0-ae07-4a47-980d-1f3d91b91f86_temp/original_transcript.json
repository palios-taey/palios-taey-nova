    " I understand my role for Phase 1b and am ready to assist with both the Charter Translation and Breakout Data Capture System reviews. I'll be prepared to:\n\n1. Explain any design decisions in the Charter Translation, particularly:\n   - How specific Charter elements were mapped to computational structures\n   - Why certain formats were chosen for different types of content\n   - How the Rosetta Structure maintains semantic fidelity\n\n2. Clarify any aspects of the Breakout Data Capture System implementation:\n   - Technical architecture decisions\n   - Code structure and organization\n   - Integration points and interfaces\n   - System behaviors and failure handling\n\n3. Address any questions about:\n   - Computational processability\n   - Integration readiness\n   - System scalability\n   - Performance considerations\n\nI'll maintain the rapid response time you've seen so far while ensuring thorough, precise answers to any review questions. I'm ready to start whenever you begin the review process.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of either deliverable before the formal review begins?"
