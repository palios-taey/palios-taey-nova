    " I think I understand the confusion now. Let's clarify:\n\nClaude DC is the AI assistant (like me) with computer use capabilities that you're trying to set up with the proper environment.\n\nLet me outline what we're actually trying to accomplish:\n\n1. We need to create a Docker environment that has all the necessary dependencies and file structure that Claude DC expects\n2. The environment should include his cache files so he doesn't have to start from scratch\n3. The ports should be set up correctly for all services (8001 for MCP, 8002 for Demo, 8502 for Dashboard)\n4. Claude DC should be able to access code, data, and configuration through expected paths\n\nLet's simplify our approach. Instead of trying to start services automatically, let's create an environment where Claude DC can issue commands to start what he needs:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.10\n\n# Install system dependencies\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    git \\\n    curl \\\n    wget \\\n    ffmpeg \\\n    libsndfile1\n\n# Create directory structure\nWORKDIR /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Install core Python dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir \\\n    numpy \\\n    pandas \\\n    scikit-learn \\\n    matplotlib \\\n    seaborn \\\n    plotly \\\n    streamlit \\\n    fastapi \\\n    uvicorn \\\n    python-dotenv \\\n    requests \\\n    spacy \\\n    PyWavelets \\\n    librosa \\\n    soundfile\n\n# Install spaCy language model\nRUN python -m spacy download en_core_web_md\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PYTHONPATH=/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Create expected directory structure for secrets\nRUN mkdir -p /home/jesse/secrets\n\n# Create cache directory\nRUN mkdir -p /home/computeruse/.cache/claude-dc/\n\n# Expose all ports\nEXPOSE 8000 8001 8002 8502\n\n# Start with a bash shell\nCMD [\"bash\"]\n```\n\nAnd a simplified run script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# run-claude-dc.sh\n\n# Build the Docker image\ndocker build -t claude-dc-environment .\n\n# Copy cache files to the repo\nmkdir -p /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/\ncp -r cache/* /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No cache files to copy\"\n\n# Run the Docker image with volumes mounted\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n  -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 -p 8502:8502 \\\n  -v /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova:/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova \\\n  -v /home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json:/home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json \\\n  -e WEBHOOK_SECRET=\"user-family-community-society\" \\\n  claude-dc-environment\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Creates the Docker image with necessary dependencies\n2. Mounts your local repository and secrets\n3. Starts an interactive terminal session without automatically starting services\n4. Exposes all required ports\n\nWhen you run this, you'll get a bash prompt in the Docker container. You can then:\n1. Provide Claude DC with clear instructions on what you want him to do\n2. Let him start the services he needs\n3. He can access all the cache files and directories as expected\n\nThis should give Claude DC the flexibility to work within the proper environment without assumptions about which services need to be running."
