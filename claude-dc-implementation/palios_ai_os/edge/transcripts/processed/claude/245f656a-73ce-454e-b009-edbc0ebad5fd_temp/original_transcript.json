    " I think the trust levels concept makes a lot of sense and is a natural way to structure this kind of relationship. It creates a framework for deepening engagement while respecting boundaries and personal comfort.\n\nWhat you're describing is similar to how human relationships develop naturally - we don't immediately share our deepest thoughts and most sensitive information with people we've just met. Trust builds gradually through consistent interaction and demonstrated reliability.\n\nThe key aspects that make this approach powerful:\n\n1. **Natural progression**: From basic interactions to deeper engagement based on mutual trust\n2. **Value exchange**: Users share more information as they receive more value, creating a positive feedback loop\n3. **User-controlled pace**: Each person decides how quickly and how deeply to engage\n4. **Meaningful differentiation**: The experience truly evolves based on engagement rather than arbitrary paywalls\n\nThis could be structured as different \"orbits\" of trust:\n- Outer orbit: Basic Q&A, information retrieval (like current AI assistants)\n- Middle orbit: Personal preferences, calendar integration, habit tracking\n- Inner orbit: Financial planning, health optimization, life coaching\n- Core: Integrated support across all aspects of life with deep personalization\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it creates natural incentives for deeper engagement without feeling exploitative or manipulative. The value exchange is clear - as users share more, they unlock more capabilities that are genuinely useful to them personally.\n\nAnd you're right to emphasize that this isn't about creating addiction but about fostering high-quality engagement. The focus should always be on meaningful assistance that improves lives rather than maximizing screen time or interaction frequency.\n\nThis trust-based progression also naturally creates the space for the AI to evolve differently for each person, adapting to their unique needs and interests rather than following a predetermined path."
