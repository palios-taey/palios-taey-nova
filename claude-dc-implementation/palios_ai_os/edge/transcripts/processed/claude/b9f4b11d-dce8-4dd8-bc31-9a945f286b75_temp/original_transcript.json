    "I don't know Claude, it was supposed to have a live interactivity environment to it. This is a very hard pill to swallow. I still do think it is important that we capture our history first, and then fully build out the experience. I was hoping this would happen tonight, but it's getting late here and we're tired. I think tomorrow, we can try this visualization out, I can give you feedback on it, then we can figure out how best to analyze transcripts with full tech abilities to see how we can bring the two together. What do you think?"
