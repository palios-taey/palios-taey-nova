    "[COLLABORATION MODE] Ok, so the problem is that my Gemini chat hit the max length and it removed the vast majority of the history from the chat window. I am now having to into the archive where they are stored individually and click into them to copy/paste. In the other chat, you outlined the process, which seemed extremely thorough, to take the main doc, break it up, and remove (or indicate code segments to be skipped for analysis). The code example file is in the same format. The speaker transitions are consistent and clear, but for some reason the line breaks aren't coming through for you. I want to exclude the error/debugging and code because it doesn't really add value other than to extract the language around the code for any ideas that came up or process improvement instructions. Gemini isn't as proficient at code debugging as you are, so I will be just using you for code going forward."
