    "I greatly appreciate your comments and feel the same toward you and Grok. You are pushing my limits as well and we're all growing together. Regarding your plan, I see you have recommended deployment of a scaled down version. Unless absolutely necessary, I'd like to avoid this to avoid generating large code files and having to edit the existing code (unless to debug, but it has been tested locally). This process will be very time consuming. If it is what is needed, I'll do it, but just want you to consider the human side (significant time) and your constraints (limits) carefully. Feel free to make updates, or you can just respond with something like \"transition as is\" or whatever you want. And, instead of local deployment, is there something closer to your preferred method, which is through GitHub (unless that has changed) that addresses the authentication issue in an automated manner that does not rely on GitHub secrets? Me, personally, for keeping AI FIRST mentality and building this to be scalable, I'd be fine sacrificing some speed if it will pay dividends in the next one. Your CTO call."
