    " Looking at the issue more deeply, you're right that we need a specific solution for this scenario. Let me create an update to the documentation quality protocol that addresses this complex case: \n\nI've created a comprehensive protocol update that addresses the specific issues we encountered with complex documents. This update introduces several key improvements:\n\n1. **Use 'HEREDOC' instead of 'EOL'**: The protocol now recommends using 'HEREDOC' as the delimiter for complex documents, which is much less likely to cause confusion than 'EOL'.\n\n2. **Line-by-Line Comments**: For highly complex documents, I've introduced a numbering system that adds line numbers as comments at the beginning of each line - this makes it much easier to track where you are in the document.\n\n3. **Multi-Part Document Creation**: Breaking complex documents into smaller, more manageable chunks to maintain better control.\n\n4. **Visual Heredoc Markers**: Using distinctive markers like 'HEREDOC_START' to make boundaries visually obvious.\n\n5. **Mandatory Verification Step**: Always verifying document creation after the fact.\n\nThe line-by-line commenting approach is particularly powerful for complex documents with code examples, as it ensures each line is clearly marked as a comment (with #) while also providing sequential numbering for tracking:\n\n```\n# 001: # Example Document\n# 002: \n# 003: Here is a complex section:\n# 004: \n# 005: ```python\n# 006: def example():\n# 007:     print(\"This is an example\")\n# 008: ```\n# 009: \n```\n\nThis should effectively address the issue we encountered while still maintaining human-error prevention. The sequential numbering makes it almost impossible to lose track of where you are in the document, even with nested code blocks.\n\nWhat do you think of these updates? Would this approach help prevent the formatting issues we encountered?"
