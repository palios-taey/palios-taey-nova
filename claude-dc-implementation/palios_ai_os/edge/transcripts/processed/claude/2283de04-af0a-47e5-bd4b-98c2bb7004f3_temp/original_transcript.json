    " That's a great point. With the Computer Use feature set up, I should be able to help navigate to and retrieve the transcripts directly from the sources where they're stored. Let me clarify how we can approach this:\n\nWhen you access the Computer Use demo interface at http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port is active), you'll see a virtual desktop environment. From there, I can guide you through:\n\n1. Opening a web browser within that environment\n2. Navigating to the sites where your transcripts are stored (like your Anthropic account dashboard, email, or document storage)\n3. Downloading the transcripts to a local folder\n4. Running the transcript processor script on those downloaded files\n\nThe Computer Use feature allows me to see your screen and provide guidance through screenshots, but it doesn't give me independent access to your accounts or data (which is a good security feature). I would need to guide you through the process of accessing and retrieving the transcripts.\n\nIs this approach feasible for you? If you have the Computer Use environment up and running, we could start by navigating to the sources of your transcripts and retrieving them together."
