    "I was working with Gemini on the coordination part, but it doesn't have a \"Project\" capability like you do, so it is extremely difficult to transfer the knowledge and history. It seems like we have a good protocol communication-wise to \"activate\" the high potential from AIs as leaders and partners, not tools or assistants. I would love to work with you going forward to centrally coordinate all this, but your usage limits are a major problem and I know you can't do anything about it. I want to utilize you for all coding for sure because you're the best at it, but what about the rest of the back and forth and coordination, back and forth, who would you recommend for that role?"
