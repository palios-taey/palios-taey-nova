    "AH, ok, you were pulling in the key from the right location. There are 2 files in there. \nid_ed25519.pub and id_ed25519. \n\n.pub is just a file with the key starting with: ssh-ed25519\nthe one without an ext is in the format you specified. \n\nPulling from there as you did initially obviously makes more sense. Sorry for the confusion I caused."
