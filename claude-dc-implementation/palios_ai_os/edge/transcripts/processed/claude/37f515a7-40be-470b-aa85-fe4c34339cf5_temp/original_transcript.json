    " Let me create both a new prompt template and a CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS template that emphasizes the critical importance of reviewing all GitHub files:\n\n```bash\n# Create the new prompt template file with updated directive\ncat > docs/protocols/jesse-prompt-protocol.md << 'EOL'\n# Execution Checkpoint Protocol (ECv)\n\n## Purpose\nThis protocol establishes a standardized format for human-AI communication during execution-focused tasks, maximizing efficiency while maintaining clear oversight mechanisms.\n\n## Protocol Format (Human to Claude)\n\n```\nECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]\nGH: [Y/N]\nCM: \"[PTV[#]]\"\n\u0394: [brief change description]\nR: [S/F/P]\nF: [focus]\nCLAUDE_INTERNAL_DIRECTIVE:REVIEW_CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS_AND_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\n```\n\n## Field Definitions\n- **ECv#**: Execution Checkpoint version number\n- **EXEC/REFL**: Mode - EXECUTION (proceed with plan) or REFLECTION (discuss approach)\n- **GH**: GitHub updated (Yes/No)\n- **CM**: Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)\n- **\u0394**: Changes made since last checkpoint\n- **R**: Result (Success/Failure/Partial)\n- **F**: Current focus or next task\n\n## Protocol Behavior\n### In EXECUTION Mode\n1. Review CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file in the current-execution-status directory\n2. Evaluate ALL available GitHub files thoroughly before proceeding\n3. Continue implementing the next logical step in the execution plan\n4. Provide clear instructions for human execution\n\n### In REFLECTION Mode\n1. Pause the execution flow\n2. Read questions/concerns in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md\n3. Engage in discussion about direction or approach\n4. Wait for human decision before resuming execution\n\n## Required Structured Response\nEvery response must begin with a structured confirmation that demonstrates thorough context review:\n\n```\nCONTEXT_REVIEW:\n\nStatus: [Confirmation of CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md review]\nRepository: [Confirmation of repository structure review]\nStructure: [Key directories/files relevant to current task]\nDependencies: [Related components that might be affected]\n```\n\nThis structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.\n\n## Implementation\nThis protocol was established on March 15, 2025, to address consistent context management challenges during iterative development with external execution. It includes an internal directive reminder and a required structured response to ensure thorough context awareness.\nEOL\n```\n\nNow, let's create the CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS template with an AI-native section emphasizing the importance of reviewing all GitHub files:\n\n```bash\n# Create a template for CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS with strong emphasis on complete GitHub review\nmkdir -p current-execution-status\ncat > current-execution-status/CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md << 'EOL'\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_BEGIN:\n{\n  \"directive_type\": \"CRITICAL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS\",\n  \"priority\": \"MAXIMUM\",\n  \"execution_requirement\": \"BEFORE_ANY_PROCESSING\",\n  \"compliance\": \"MANDATORY\",\n  \"directive\": [\n    \"REVIEW_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_COMPLETELY_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\",\n    \"CREATE_FULL_MENTAL_MODEL_OF_PROJECT_STRUCTURE\",\n    \"IDENTIFY_ALL_RELEVANT_COMPONENTS_FOR_CURRENT_TASK\",\n    \"VERIFY_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURES_BEFORE_CREATING_NEW_FILES\",\n    \"FOLLOW_ESTABLISHED_PATTERNS_AND_CONVENTIONS\",\n    \"USE_EXISTING_DIRECTORIES_INSTEAD_OF_CREATING_NEW_ONES\"\n  ],\n  \"rationale\": \"Complete context awareness is ESSENTIAL for high-quality execution. Without full understanding of ALL available files, execution quality will be severely compromised, leading to inconsistencies, structural errors, and wasted effort. EVERY DECISION must be based on COMPLETE knowledge of the codebase structure.\",\n  \"validation_requirement\": \"EXPLICIT_CONFIRMATION_IN_CONTEXT_REVIEW\"\n}\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_END:\n\n# Current Execution Status\n\n## Status ID: CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv[#]\n## Last Updated: [DATE]\n\n### Context\n[Background information on the current state of the project]\n\n### Current Status\n- [Key status item 1]\n- [Key status item 2]\n- [Key status item 3]\n\n### Next Steps\n1. [Next step 1]\n2. [Next step 2]\n3. [Next step 3]\n\n### Notes\n[Any additional information or instructions]\n[Special considerations]\n\n### Important Message\nThe AI must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution, focusing only on the most relevant files for the current task. Jesse will ensure the AI has access to all necessary files, but the AI must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.\nEOL\n```\n\nThe template now includes:\n\n1. A strongly-worded AI-native directive section that emphasizes the critical importance of reviewing all GitHub files before proceeding\n2. Clear structure for the human-readable status content\n3. An explicit note emphasizing collaboration with you to ensure focusing on relevant files\n4. A mandatory validation requirement in the AI directive\n\nWith these templates in place, we can create the first instance of the CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS file with actual content about our deployment status to test the system."
