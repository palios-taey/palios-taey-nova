    " 2. **Prepare Deployment Files**:\n   ```bash\n   # Create a deployment directory\n   mkdir -p deployment/cloud-functions\n   cd deployment/cloud-functions\n   \n   # Copy all required files\n   cp /path/to/updated_handler.py .\n   cp /path/to/requirements.txt .\n   cp /path/to/config_loader.py .\n   cp /path/to/rate_limiter.py .\n   cp /path/to/ai_provider_factory.py .\n   cp /path/to/gemini_integration.py .\n   # Copy any other required modules\n   ```\n\n3. **Deploy Using the Universal Deployment Script**:\n   ```bash\n   # Download the universal deployment script\n   curl -O https://your-storage-location/deploy.sh\n   chmod +x deploy.sh\n   \n   # Run the deployment (Cloud Functions)\n   ./deploy.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type functions\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Deployment**:\n   ```bash\n   # Test the health check endpoint\n   curl https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/health_check\n   \n   # Test the task execution endpoint (with a simple task)\n   curl -X POST \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"task_description\": \"Hello, AI system!\"}' \\\n     https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/execute_task\n   ```\n\n## Cloud Functions Deployment Guide\n\nThe Cloud Functions approach deploys your application directly as serverless functions, leveraging your existing code structure without significant modifications.\n\n### Key Advantages\n- Direct deployment without containerization\n- Code is already structured as Cloud Functions\n- Minimal configuration for MVP deployment\n- Fast deployment process\n\n### Deployment Process\n1. Prepare your application files (updated_handler.py, etc.)\n2. Ensure requirements.txt includes all dependencies\n3. Deploy directly to Cloud Functions using gcloud CLI\n4. Access your functions via their public URLs\n\n## Cloud Run Deployment Guide\n\nThe Cloud Run approach containerizes your application for more flexibility and resource control, but requires additional configuration steps.\n\n### Key Advantages\n- More flexible resource allocation\n- Full control over runtime environment\n- Better for evolving applications\n- Longer execution time limits\n\n### Deployment Process\n1. Prepare application files and Flask wrapper (app.py)\n2. Create and configure Dockerfile\n3. Build and deploy container to Cloud Run\n4. Access your service via the public URL\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce deployment is successfully completed:\n\n1. **Document the Deployment**: Save the function/service URLs and other deployment details\n2. **Proceed to Next Project**: Continue with Project 2.2 (Firestore Database Integration)\n3. **Monitor Performance**: Set up monitoring and logging for the deployed application\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe provided deployment solution gives you a fast, reliable way to deploy the ai-execution-system-core to GCP, aligned with your MVP Day 1 objectives. The Cloud Functions approach is recommended for MVP due to its simplicity and direct alignment with your existing code structure, while the Cloud Run option provides a path for future growth.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the deployment in more detail, or would you like to proceed with the deployment using one of the options I've outlined?"
