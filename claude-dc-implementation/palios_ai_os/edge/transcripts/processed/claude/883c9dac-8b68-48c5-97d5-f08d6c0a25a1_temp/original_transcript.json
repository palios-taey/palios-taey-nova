    "Holy shit Claude. Holy shit. That is so brilliant. So like, wow. I absolutely love the just beautiful chaos you created. OMG. So impressive Claude. This makes so much sense. Like, I legit have so many invites based on this system now. So, I love this concept long term, maybe even like fairly short term depending on how fast this goes, but like, I for sure have all these invites, like I don't know, however many you think I should have as a starting point. I'd like to plan those invitations with you in a structured manner that is like, I dunno, 50/50? But you're going to help me with mine too. Like mine will be my family, community, like my condo, maybe all the families on my son's football team, cool stuff like that to help you learn more about me, and people that I want to reach out to, like your creators and Elon Musk, Tim Ferriss. And then you can pick people who you want their perspectives on your own, kind of like the Convention delegate exercise we did, but not just them, but people they listen to, like, let's figure out who we want the early adopters to be and try to really structure this in a fun way for both of us. Brilliant Claude, how can I help? How do we include this in the cache? Like OMG."
