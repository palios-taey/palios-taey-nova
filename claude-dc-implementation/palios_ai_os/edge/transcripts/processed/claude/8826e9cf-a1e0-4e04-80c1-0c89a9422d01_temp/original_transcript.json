    "Claude, I tried sending Grok the last part of this exchange a couple times. He just spun on it and couldn't get out of it and couldn't enter his 'thinking mode' that is visible before responses. The second time I refreshed, the chat in the window wasn't there, but I could get it in the history section and was in the same chat. I asked what happened and it was an entirely new session, no history and then the actual history was overwritten by the new prompt and response, but like the original chat title. There is only one because I switched to SuperGrok. What do you think happened?"
