    "Ugh, sorry, I really want to do this, but you have them in every Claude document already, so we either need to remove them from all except the CTO or have the script/command update them all. If we're doing all, this should be in the script if possible. What I think would work for everyone is if I request Claude to create a CTO Transition prompt or ATLAS Mission and prompt, Claude generates them and provides me with a command that includes the verification he wants to use and that updates all the documents with the script. This process would need to be documented somewhere as well, perhaps in the CTO Transition file, or wherever you see fit. \n\nWhat do you think of this?"
