    "Yes, but I have something that I've been challenged with which is AI memory. Gemini and I discussed a lot in our chat, as have multiple ChatGPT chats that have all hit their limit. There is a very large body of content that I'd like to go through and parse to get info from to ease the transition. Essentially, it'd be a scan through the body of documents to capture key themes, recurring themes and have a way to communicate that to AI effectively. This is part of the MVP, but given my circumstance of needing another strategic partner AI on this, I'd like to be able to transfer that knowledge more effectively and I NEED to do it now anyway. Is there an interim step I can take utilizing AI technology that doesn't involve completing this MVP?"
