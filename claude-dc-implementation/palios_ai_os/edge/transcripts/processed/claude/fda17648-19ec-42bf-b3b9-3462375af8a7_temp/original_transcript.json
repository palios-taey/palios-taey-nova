    " Let's follow the AI FIRST approach, which emphasizes preserving the original intent and structure while making the minimal necessary changes to get it working.\n\nTo get your exact path in a copy/paste format, you can use the `pwd` command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npwd\n```\n\nThis will print your current working directory in an exact format you can copy/paste.\n\nOnce you have your current directory path, we can use a hybrid approach:\n\n1. First, let's create a config overlay file that will redirect Claude DC's hardcoded paths to your actual paths without modifying his original code\n\n2. We'll create a small Python loader script that applies these path mappings before running any of the original code\n\nThis approach is AI FIRST because:\n- It preserves all of Claude DC's original code without modifications\n- It honors his design decisions and implementation\n- It maintains compatibility with his expectations when he returns\n- It focuses on enabling the AI capabilities rather than rewriting them\n\nOnce you share your actual path, I'll provide the specific commands to implement this approach."
