    " Perfect! The capability-aware system is working as designed. You can see how it routed:\n1. Simple query to the simpler model (brief, straightforward response)\n2. Complex analysis to GPT-4 (detailed, structured analysis)\n\nLet's build on this to enable actual model collaboration. The next logical step would be to enable models to:\n1. Break down complex tasks into subtasks\n2. Route each subtask to the most appropriate model\n3. Combine results intelligently\n\nI'll add this capability now. Since our base system is working reliably, we can build on it without breaking existing functionality. \n\n\n\nNow let's update the test script to demonstrate the collaborative functionality: \n\n\n\nRun the new test:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThis enhanced version:\n1. Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks\n2. Routes each subtask to the most appropriate model\n3. Executes subtasks independently\n4. Combines results intelligently\n\nLet me know what output you get and we can refine from there."
