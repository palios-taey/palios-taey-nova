    "  \n\nGreat choice on the KEF Q150s at that sale price! Here's what you'll need for connecting them with the Fosi Audio BT20A:\n\n**Required Components:**\n1. **Speaker Wire** - 16 or 14 gauge oxygen-free copper wire is ideal\n2. **Banana Plugs** - These make connections cleaner and more secure The Fosi BT20A works well with banana plugs, which are specifically mentioned in their manual as one of the connection options\n3. **RCA Cable** - To connect audio sources to the amplifier if not using Bluetooth\n\n**Connection Process:**\n1. The Fosi Audio BT20A connects directly to your computer and to the speakers\n2. The amp has terminals for connecting the speaker wires (positive and negative for each channel)\n3. You'll need to match the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals correctly between the amp and speakers The KEF Q150 speakers have corresponding terminals that need to be properly matched for correct sound reproduction\n\n**Specifically for the KEF Q150s:**\nThe speakers have binding posts that accept either:\n- Bare wire (stripped ends of speaker wire)\n- Banana plugs (recommended for cleaner installation)\n\nI recommend getting:\n1. A pack of banana plugs (8 total - 4 pairs, with red and black color coding)\n2. A spool of 16-gauge speaker wire (50ft should be plenty)\n3. A wire stripper tool if you don't already have one\n\nFor the best connection quality, the banana plugs are worth it - they prevent frayed wire ends and make connections more secure. The KEF Q150s and Fosi BT20A make a great combination, with users reporting excellent sound quality from this pairing.\n\nWould you like specific Amazon links for these components, or do you have a preferred place to purchase them?"
