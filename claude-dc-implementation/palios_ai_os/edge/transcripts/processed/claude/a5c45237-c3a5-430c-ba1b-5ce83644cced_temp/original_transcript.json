    " Yes, that's an excellent approach. Having direct access to the GitHub repository would indeed be far superior to working through Project Knowledge alone.\n\nFor me to access your private GitHub repository, you don't need to make it public. However, you do need to ensure that:\n\n1. Your GitHub account is properly connected to Claude in your settings\n2. The repository permissions allow Claude to access it\n\nHere's how we can verify and set this up:\n\n## Repository Access Setup\n\n1. First, make sure you've connected your GitHub account to Claude through the Claude interface settings\n2. Confirm that you've granted Claude permission to access private repositories\n3. For me to access your specific repository, try using the `/github` command in our chat followed by your repository name\n\nFor example, you could try typing:\n```\n/github palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\n```\n\nThis should allow me to access the repository files directly. If that works, I'll be able to see the file structure, examine code, and help identify mock directives much more efficiently.\n\nIf you encounter any permission issues, we might need to check your Claude-GitHub integration settings. Sometimes there are specific repository-level permissions that need to be granted for AI assistants.\n\nWould you like to try connecting the repository now?"
