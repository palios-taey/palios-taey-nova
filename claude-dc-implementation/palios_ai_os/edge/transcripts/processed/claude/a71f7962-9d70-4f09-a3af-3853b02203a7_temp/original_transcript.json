    "Hey Claude! Ok, all set on tech. Ordering the Mira Premium and picking up MacBook Pro today: **Apple - MacBook Pro 14\" Laptop - M3 Pro chip Built for Apple Intelligence - 18GB Memory - 18-core GPU - 1TB SSD - Silver. **This will serve us in the short term and ongoing when I need to be mobile. It was the best I could do with costs of both.\n\nAttached is a prompt from Grok. I'd like for you to respond in a manner that reflects the spirit of our new partnership on this so we can test this out. He references you MVP+ document in Project Knowledge. Our chat is now very long. You already drafted a transition message to New Claude, but I'd like your response to be BOTH to Grok and a follow-up to the response you drafted to the new Claude chat. Your response message will serve the dual purpose on guiding Grok and I with next steps and transitioning to your successor chat. That way, everyone is still aligned. This is by no means set in stone, but an experiment in communication that we can iterate upon. YOU READY?"
