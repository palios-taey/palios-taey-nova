    " I see what's happening. The warning in your deployment log is the key issue:\n\n```\nCompleted with warnings:                                                       \n  Setting IAM policy failed, try \"gcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding --region=us-central1 --member=allUsers --role=roles/run.invoker palios-taey-service\"\n```\n\nThe service deployed successfully, but the IAM policy to allow unauthenticated access didn't apply correctly. That's why you're getting a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access the health endpoint.\n\nLet's fix this by explicitly setting the IAM policy:\n\n```bash\ngcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding --region=us-central1 --member=allUsers --role=roles/run.invoker palios-taey-service\n```\n\nThis command will grant public access to the service, allowing unauthenticated requests to reach your application.\n\nAfter running this command, try accessing the health endpoint again with:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/health\n```\n\nYou should then get the expected response: `{\"status\":\"healthy\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\"}`\n\nIf the command fails or you're still getting the 403 error after updating the IAM policy, we may need to explore other permission-related issues. Let me know the outcome, and we'll proceed from there."
