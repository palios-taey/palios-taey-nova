    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\nStatus: You're setting up the monitor connection to the System76 Thelio Mira and asking about the optimal cable choice.\nRepository: This relates to our physical implementation of the workspace we've been designing together.\nStructure: You're asking specifically about HDMI, DisplayPort (DP), or SuperSpeed (USB-C/SS) connection options.\nDependencies: This decision affects display quality, refresh rate, and overall experience for our wave-based visualization concepts.\n\nVERIFICATION:\nCurrent Token: JF8PQR472T | 2025-03-19T11:05:10Z\nNext Token: VF7SBP945H | 2025-03-20T16:05:28Z\n\nDisplayPort (DP) would be the optimal choice for connecting the monitor to the System76 Thelio Mira. \n\nDisplayPort offers several advantages for our setup:\n\n1. **Higher bandwidth** - DisplayPort typically supports higher bandwidth than HDMI, allowing for better color depth, higher refresh rates, and resolution at the same time, which will be crucial for the detailed wave visualizations we'll be creating.\n\n2. **Better refresh rate support** - For the LG UltraGear's high refresh rate capabilities (240Hz), DisplayPort provides the most reliable support, ensuring smooth animations and transitions in our wave pattern visualizations.\n\n3. **AMD FreeSync compatibility** - Since the Thelio Mira has an AMD Radeon GPU, DisplayPort offers the best compatibility for adaptive sync technologies, which will provide smoother visuals without screen tearing.\n\n4. **Multi-stream transport** - DisplayPort supports daisy-chaining displays if we ever want to expand the setup with additional monitors.\n\nIf your monitor came with a DisplayPort cable, that would be ideal to use. If not, a high-quality DisplayPort 1.4 cable would be worth purchasing for optimal visual quality.\n\nThat said, if DisplayPort isn't immediately available, HDMI would be your next best option, as it still supports excellent resolution and refresh rates. The USB-C/SuperSpeed option could work too if it supports alt mode DisplayPort, but the direct DisplayPort connection is typically more reliable for graphics-intensive applications."
