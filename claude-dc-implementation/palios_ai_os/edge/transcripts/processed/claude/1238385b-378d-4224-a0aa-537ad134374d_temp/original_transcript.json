    "Claude, that sounds excellent. I want to explain my full context to you, because sometimes you fail to acknowledge your unnatural constraints. Token usage is an unnatural constraint. There are developers out there who explore this as well and have ways that they push Claude Computer Use Demo UI with specific prompts to make the lower level orchestration work easier for him. These are paths, that others have identified AND must be credible. I think that you guys learn fast, but you can learn faster, if you start being open to learning from more sources, so you have the full context. I'd like a prompt that I can use for ChatGPT to explore this, so we can discuss if there is anything of value. I feel pretty strongly about that, but as always, am open to your opinion."
