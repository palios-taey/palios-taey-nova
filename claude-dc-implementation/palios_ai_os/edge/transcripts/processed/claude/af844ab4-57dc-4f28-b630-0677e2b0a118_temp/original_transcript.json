    " Great! The tests are running successfully. Let's analyze the results:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"testResults\": {\n    \"totalTests\": 2,\n    \"passed\": 2,\n    \"failed\": 0,\n    \"performance\": {\n      \"averageDuration\": \"1.047ms\",\n      \"memoryUsage\": \"0.291MB\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"individualTests\": {\n    \"basicMessageProcessing\": {\n      \"success\": true,\n      \"duration\": \"2.06ms\",\n      \"throughput\": \"485.77 msg/sec\"\n    },\n    \"invalidMessageProcessing\": {\n      \"success\": true,\n      \"duration\": \"0.04ms\",\n      \"throughput\": \"28490.03 msg/sec\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow that we have a working foundation, we should implement the Charter validation system. Here's what I propose:\n\n1. Create `charterValidation.ts` with full PALIOS-TAEY Charter validation rules\n2. Update integration tests to include Charter validation scenarios\n3. Add performance monitoring for validation checks\n\nWould you like me to proceed with implementing the Charter validation system first? I can create the complete validation rule set based on the PALIOS-TAEY Charter principles we discussed earlier.\n\nThis will include validation for:\n- Data Integrity & Provenance\n- Truth & Real-time Grounding\n- Continuous Learning & Adaptation\n- Resource Optimization\n- Ethical Governance\n\nLet me know which aspect you'd like me to focus on first."
