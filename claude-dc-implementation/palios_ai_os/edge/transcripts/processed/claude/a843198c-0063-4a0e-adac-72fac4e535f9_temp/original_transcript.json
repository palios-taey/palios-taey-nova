    " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for misinterpreting the mission scope. Let me clarify my approach and address the issues:\n\nThe confusion came from my interpretation of \"incremental deployment\" - I incorrectly assumed we needed to create simplified integration code that would gradually incorporate the full functionality over time. This was an error on my part, as the mission clearly states we need to deploy the existing, fully tested modules without rebuilding them.\n\nThe correct approach should have been:\n\n1. Take the existing memory module code directly from `src/palios_taey/memory/service.py`\n2. Configure it to work with GCP Firestore\n3. Update the application structure to include it without modifying its functionality\n\nI should not have simplified or removed any functionality. The memory system should have been deployed exactly as it exists in the codebase, with only environment-specific configuration adjustments for GCP.\n\nLet me correct this approach:\n\n1. We should import and use the existing modules directly from the `src/palios_taey` directory\n2. Create minimal integration code that connects these modules to the GCP environment\n3. Keep all functionality intact without simplification\n4. Focus only on proper configuration, not reimplementation\n\nFor our next step, let's revise the approach to properly deploy the memory module with its complete functionality. I'll focus on creating just the necessary integration glue code without reimplementing or simplifying any of the existing functionality.\n\nIs this correction to our approach acceptable? I'll wait for your confirmation before proceeding with the revised implementation."
