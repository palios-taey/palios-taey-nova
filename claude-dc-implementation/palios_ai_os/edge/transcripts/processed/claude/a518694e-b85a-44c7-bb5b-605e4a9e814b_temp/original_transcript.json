    " I understand your focus on minimizing manual effort not just now but for future iterations as well. Let's take a strategic approach that aligns with our NOVA methodology and builds a sustainable foundation.\n\nHere's what I recommend for the next phase:\n\n1. **Self-Initializing Components**: Let's modify our core components to automatically initialize with sensible defaults when configurations are missing. This follows the \"self-healing\" principle in modern cloud architecture.\n\n2. **Automatic Collection Creation**: For Firestore collections, we'll implement automatic creation and initialization of necessary collections with sample data when they don't exist.\n\n3. **Mock Mode Toggle**: We'll implement a robust mock mode that can be toggled with a single environment variable, making testing straightforward without external dependencies.\n\nLet me prepare these changes for the most critical component first - the model registry, which is needed by many other components: \n\n\n\nNow, let's enhance the memory service module to make it resilient and self-initializing:"
