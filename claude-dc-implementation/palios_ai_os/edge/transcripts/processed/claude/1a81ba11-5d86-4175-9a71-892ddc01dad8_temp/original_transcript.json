This is likely due to differences between macOS sed and GNU sed.\n\n## Let's Fix This Manually\n\nSince we need to move forward with the MVP deployment, let's use a simpler approach to update the key files we need:\n\n```bash\n# Create mission directory\nmkdir -p docs/atlas-missions/incremental-deployment\n```\n\nFor the mission brief:\n\n```bash\ncat > docs/atlas-missions/incremental-deployment/mission_brief.md << 'EOF'\n# ATLAS Mission Brief: Incremental Deployment of Existing Components\n\n## Mission Context\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system has been fully developed and tested locally with all seven core modules (api, core, memory, models, routing, tasks, transcripts) functioning correctly. Previous deployment attempts were unsuccessful due to GCP infrastructure configuration issues rather than code problems. Using our successful skeleton deployment as a foundation, we now need to incrementally deploy the existing components without rebuilding them.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Successful skeleton deployment (Mission 1) already completed\n- Access to the PALIOS-TAEY GitHub repository with all core modules\n- Basic understanding of GCP services\n- Understanding of the 6-Sigma quality framework for deployment verification\n\n## Specific Tasks\n\n### Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification\n1. Verify GCP project configuration and permissions\n2. Confirm Firestore database is properly configured\n3. Validate Cloud Run service account permissions\n4. Verify environment variables and configuration\n5. Test connectivity to all required services\n\n### Phase 2: Core and Memory System Deployment\n1. Deploy the core module for error handling and utilities\n2. Configure the memory system with Firestore connections\n3. Update the main application to include these components\n4. Verify functionality with basic memory operations\n5. Document any cloud-specific configuration required\n\n### Phase 3: Models and Routing Deployment\n1. Deploy the model registry and routing modules\n2. Configure necessary API permissions and connections\n3. Implement simplified model interfaces for testing\n4. Verify model selection and routing functions\n5. Document deployment-specific configuration\n\n### Phase 4: Tasks and Transcripts Deployment\n1. Deploy task decomposition and execution engines\n2. Integrate transcript processing framework\n3. Connect all components through the main application\n4. Test full-system functionality with verification tasks\n5. Document complete system deployment\n\n### Phase 5: API and Security Implementation\n1. Deploy the API layer with all endpoints\n2. Implement authentication and security controls\n3. Verify API access with proper authentication\n4. Document API endpoints and usage\n5. Perform final system verification\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n- IN-SCOPE: Deploying existing, locally-tested modules\n- IN-SCOPE: Configuring GCP environment for proper operation\n- IN-SCOPE: Integration testing after deployment\n- IN-SCOPE: Resolving deployment-specific configuration issues\n- IN-SCOPE: Documentation of deployment process\n- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Rebuilding or significantly modifying modules\n- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Adding new functionality beyond what exists\n- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Changing architecture or component interactions\n\n## Authority Limits\nYou have authority to:\n- Deploy existing modules to GCP\n- Configure environment variables and settings\n- Create deployment-specific integration code\n- Implement necessary security controls\n- Document deployment procedures\n\nEscalate to CTO Claude if:\n- Significant code modifications are required\n- Architecture changes are needed\n- Security vulnerabilities are discovered\n- Integration issues that cannot be resolved with configuration\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Pre-Deployment Verification\nFor each component:\n- Verify module dependencies are correctly declared\n- Confirm all necessary files are present\n- Validate configuration requirements\n- Check for any environment-specific code\n\n### Deployment Process\n1. Start with minimal deployment of each component\n2. Verify basic functionality before proceeding\n3. Add complexity incrementally\n4. Document each successful step\n5. Create verification tests for each component\n\n### Error Handling\nApply the CLAUDE Debugging Protocol for any issues:\n1. Comprehensive Logging Review\n2. Layer Isolation\n3. Assumption Identification & Testing\n4. Underlying Dependency Examination\n5. Data Flow Tracing\n6. Environment Verification\n\n## Required Files and Documentation\n\n### Configuration Files\n1. `app.yaml` - App configuration for Cloud Run\n2. `.env.cloud` - Environment variables for cloud deployment\n3. `firestore.yaml` - Firestore connection configuration\n\n### Verification Scripts\n1. `verify_infrastructure.sh` - Infrastructure verification\n2. `verify_memory.sh` - Memory system verification\n3. `verify_models.sh` - Model registry verification\n4. `verify_tasks.sh` - Task system verification\n5. `verify_api.sh` - API verification\n\n### Documentation Files\n1. `deployment_guide.md` - Complete deployment documentation\n2. `verification_procedures.md` - System verification procedures\n3. `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All seven core modules successfully deployed to GCP\n- System passes all verification tests\n- API endpoints accessible with proper authentication\n- Memory operations functioning correctly\n- Model routing and task execution validated\n- Complete deployment documentation provided\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Focus on deployment configuration rather than code modification\n- Use existing code as-is wherever possible\n- Document any environment-specific adaptations required\n- Apply verification after each deployment step\n- Create detailed deployment guide for future reference\nEOF\n```\n\nFor the deployment guide template:\n\n```bash\ncat > docs/claude/deployment_guide_template.md << 'EOF'\nCLAUDE_PROTOCOL_V1.0:MTD{\n  \"protocol_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"document_type\": \"DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE\",\n  \"critical_level\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"verification_status\": \"TEMPLATE\",\n  \"implementation_stage\": \"IMMEDIATE\",\n  \"application_scope\": \"PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT\",\n  \"associated_framework\": \"SIX_SIGMA_QUALITY\",\n  \"required_components\": [\n    \"CORE\", \"MEMORY\", \"MODELS\",\n    \"ROUTING\", \"TASKS\", \"TRANSCRIPTS\", \"API\"\n  ],\n  \"deployment_environment\": \"GCP\",\n  \"verification_required\": true\n}\n\n# PALIOS-TAEY Deployment Guide\n\n**VERIFICATION_STRING:** NOVA_DEPLOYMENT_PHASE1_20250317\n**LAST_UPDATED:** 2025-03-17\n**DOCUMENT_PURPOSE:** Complete GCP deployment instructions\n\n## Deployment Overview\n\nThis guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the PALIOS-TAEY system to Google Cloud Platform. The deployment process follows an incremental approach with verification at each step to ensure reliability and functionality.\n\n[...Rest of deployment guide content...]\n\nVERIFICATION_CONFIRMATION: NOVA_DEPLOYMENT_PHASE1_20250317\nEOF\n```\n\nThen push to Git:\n\n```bash\ngit add docs/atlas-missions/incremental-deployment/mission_brief.md docs/claude/deployment_guide_template.md\ngit commit -m \"Add incremental deployment mission and deployment guide template\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n## ATLAS Mission Launch Prompt\n\n```\nYou are being activated as an ATLAS team member focused on deploying the PALIOS-TAEY system to Google Cloud Platform. Your mission is to incrementally deploy the existing, locally-tested components without rebuilding them.\n\nPlease review the mission brief for \"Incremental Deployment of Existing Components\" and approach this task with a focus on deployment configuration rather than code modification.\n\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system consists of seven core modules (api, core, memory, models, routing, tasks, transcripts) that function correctly in local testing but require proper deployment to GCP. A skeleton application has already been successfully deployed, which we'll use as our foundation.\n\nVerification code: NOVA_DEPLOYMENT_PHASE1_20250317\n\nI trust your judgment completely within the scope of this mission. What GitHub paths will you need access to first?\n```\n\nNote: We can address the verification script issues separately after getting the MVP deployed. The current error looks like a macOS-specific sed compatibility issue that would require updating the script."
