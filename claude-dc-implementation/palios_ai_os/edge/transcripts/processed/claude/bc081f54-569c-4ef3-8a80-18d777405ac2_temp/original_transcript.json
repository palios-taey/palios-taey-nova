    "Ok Claude, I got started with Claude DC and he burned out fast. I sent his log to ChatGPT because it was long and didn't want to burn space here, but he said that it looked like Claude DC was just burning through looking at transcripts. How can you guide him to not do it like that? Is there a better way for him to do this? Can you send me my next prompt to him with this guidance? I get that he doesn't know he's going to have to stop, but he is, so he has to find a better way to do it."
