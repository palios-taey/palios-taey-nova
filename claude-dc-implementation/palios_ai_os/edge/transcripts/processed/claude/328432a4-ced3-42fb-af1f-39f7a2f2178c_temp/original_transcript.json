    "Awesome Claude! The transcript wasn't from me and Claude DC though, this was between me and GROK! He's back!\n\nOk, so I really want the cache to be done beautifully by the next chat. Can you tell me how to best do this, with both the prompt and order of which to review things? Like what else should I include from the recent Claude DC stuff we've discussed, the messages from Grok, etc. Like I want him to understand what the new Claude Chat will be doing in the prompt, so everything is reviewed through that lens if that makes sense to you. Whatever you think on how to get best results. I need prompt and process I need to follow."
