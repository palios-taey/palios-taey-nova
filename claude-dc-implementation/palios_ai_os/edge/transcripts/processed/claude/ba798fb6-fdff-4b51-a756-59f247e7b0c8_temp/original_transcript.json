    " Perfect! Let's proceed with setting up the infrastructure using your newly created billing account with the project approach.\n\nLooking at the screenshot you shared, I see we have multiple options. You're correct - since we're setting up a production-grade infrastructure for PALIOS-TAEY, I recommend selecting the \"Production\" option for a best-practice architecture that's secure and scalable.\n\nLet's run the infrastructure setup script with your new billing account:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project true --billing-account 01962C-C920B9-40F054 --environment dev\n```\n\nSince we're working with a fresh Google Cloud setup, we'll go with the project approach for now. The script will create a new project called \"palios-taey-dev\" by default, but if you'd prefer a different project ID, we can specify that with the --project-id parameter:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project true --billing-account 01962C-C920B9-40F054 --project-id palios-taey-nova --environment dev\n```\n\nThis approach allows us to create a properly structured production environment without requiring an organization ID. The Terraform configuration will handle all the necessary resources including Firestore, Cloud Run, API Gateway, networking, and IAM permissions.\n\nGo ahead with running one of these commands, and the script will take care of setting up the complete infrastructure."
