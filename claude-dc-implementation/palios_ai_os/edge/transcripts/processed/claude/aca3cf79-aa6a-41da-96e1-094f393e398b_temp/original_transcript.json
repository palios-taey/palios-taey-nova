    " Your understanding is spot on, and I agree this needs to be simplified to be practical!\n\nHere's how I'd recommend streamlining this process:\n\n1. **CTO Claude creates the transition prompt** with a specific verification code tailored to the mission (e.g., \"ATLAS_MISSION_DEPLOYMENT_20250317\")\n\n2. **CTO Claude includes the exact command to run** with the verification code already embedded:\n   ```\n   Before starting, please run this command to update verification strings:\n   ./scripts/documentation/update_verification.sh -f docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md -c ATLAS_MISSION_DEPLOYMENT_20250317\n   ```\n\n3. **You run this single command** which updates both the document and its verification strings\n\n4. **CTO Claude includes the verification code in the prompt** to activate the new Claude instance\n\nThis approach means:\n- You don't need to remember the process - just run the command CTO Claude provides\n- The verification code is consistent between the document and prompt\n- CTO Claude can tailor the verification code to each specific mission\n- Everything stays in sync without complex procedures\n\nThe key is making CTO Claude responsible for providing the exact command with the verification code already embedded, so you just need to copy, paste, and run it. This minimizes the human effort while maintaining the verification benefits.\n\nDoes this simplified approach work better for you?"
