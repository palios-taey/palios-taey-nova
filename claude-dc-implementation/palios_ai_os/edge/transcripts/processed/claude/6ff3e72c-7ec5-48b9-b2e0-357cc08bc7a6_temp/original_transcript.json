    " Here's the curl command to update the cache:\n\n```bash\ncurl -o /home/computeruse/cache/CACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova/refs/heads/main/current-execution-status/jesse/CACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION.md\n```\n\nThis will download the cache update file from GitHub and save it to Claude DC's cache directory. You can use this command between the first and third messages I provided.\n\nThe complete sequence would be:\n\n1. Send the initial message asking Claude DC to review his existing cache\n2. Send this curl command to update the cache\n3. Send the follow-up message asking him to proceed with implementation based on the updated cache\n\nThis approach will ensure Claude DC has all the context he needs while keeping the token usage manageable."
