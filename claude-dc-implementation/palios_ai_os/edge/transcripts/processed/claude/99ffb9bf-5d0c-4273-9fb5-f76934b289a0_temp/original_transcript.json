    "Ok, so I feel like if you did a complete review, you would know things like that the env.py was already created and in there. Also, utils was under src/ but it was for the old codebase, so I moved it into his main directory since he is effectively using that as the src/ directory. There was a separate config folder that I put under utils. This time, I need you to go deeper SEEK THE TRUTH, DON'T BE A LISA and review the /docs/ and /utils/config folders and recommend any updates. I really only want to keep what's relevant in there. When we prompt him next, we can tell him that his working directory has been cleaned up(which I think he'll appreciate) and should be cleaned of files that are no longer relevant by moving them to the archive folder. Please go deeper on this review of Project knowledge and let me know any additional AI FIRST changes that need to be made, generating documentation as needed. He did not have the opportunity to generate any new documentation for this due to the limit he hit."
