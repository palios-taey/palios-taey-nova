    " Great! I see the local tests are now working perfectly - both the task execution and health check endpoints are responding correctly. This confirms our implementation is solid.\n\nI notice a few things:\n\n1. **Local Tests**: All passed successfully \u2705\n   - Task endpoint is responding correctly with provider and model information\n   - Health check is returning the proper JSON with system status\n\n2. **Deployed Endpoint Tests**: \n   - Task execution is working \u2705\n   - Health check is failing \u274c (as expected since it hasn't been deployed yet)\n\n3. **API Usage Monitor**: Is missing the matplotlib dependency\n\nLet's fix the dependency issue first. You'll need to install the matplotlib library:\n\n```bash\npip install matplotlib pandas numpy\n```\n\nThe deployment looks good and ready to go. Now you have two options:\n\n1. **Deploy everything to Cloud Functions**:\n   This would involve deploying both the task execution and health check endpoints to Google Cloud.\n\n2. **Continue using the local implementation** for testing and development:\n   This gives you more flexibility to make changes without affecting the production system.\n\nFor now, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Install the missing dependencies\n2. Continue testing with the local implementation to confirm everything works as expected\n3. When ready, deploy to Cloud Functions\n\nWould you like specific deployment commands for Cloud Functions, or would you prefer to continue working with the local implementation for now?"
