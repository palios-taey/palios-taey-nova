    " You're right, and I apologize for the confusion. The role name I provided was incorrect. Let's correct that information.\n\nFor Gemini Pro API access, you should use one of these specific roles:\n\n1. **`roles/aiplatform.user`** doesn't exist as you pointed out.\n\nInstead, use one of these roles:\n\n- **`roles/aiplatform.viewer`** - Minimum role needed for read access to Vertex AI and Generative AI APIs\n- **`roles/aiplatform.user`** - For users who need to use models but not create resources\n- **`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`** - Needed to consume enabled APIs\n\nYou can assign these roles with gcloud:\n\n```bash\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \\\n    --member=\"serviceAccount:YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\" \\\n    --role=\"roles/aiplatform.user\"\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure you have the Vertex AI and Generative Language APIs enabled in your project:\n\n```bash\ngcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com generativelanguage.googleapis.com\n```\n\nFor completeness, here's a corrected set of roles that should work for accessing the Gemini Pro API:\n\n1. **`roles/serviceAccountTokenCreator`** (which you already have)\n2. **`roles/aiplatform.user`** (for using AI models)\n3. **`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`** (for consuming the enabled APIs)\n\nIf you continue to face issues, using the API key approach from the last artifact may be simpler for initial testing. Would you like me to provide any further clarification on the roles or the implementation?"
