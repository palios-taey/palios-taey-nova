    " I see the issue now. The OpenAI API key isn't being properly accessed in the Cloud Function environment. Let's update the `execute_task` function to properly retrieve and use the OpenAI API key. \n\nLet's fix the issue with the OpenAI API key. In the Cloud Function environment, it seems the global `openai.api_key` initialization in the AISystem class isn't being passed to the `execute_task` function.\n\nHere's what to do next:\n\n1. Replace only the `execute_task` function in your `main.py` file with the one I provided above.\n\n2. Deploy the updated function again:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend-v2 --runtime python310 --entry-point execute_task --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --source=.\n   ```\n\n3. Test it again with:\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\n   ```\n\nThis version of the `execute_task` function establishes its own connection to Firestore to retrieve the OpenAI API key instead of relying on initialization from other parts of the file. This ensures the key is properly loaded within the function's execution context."
