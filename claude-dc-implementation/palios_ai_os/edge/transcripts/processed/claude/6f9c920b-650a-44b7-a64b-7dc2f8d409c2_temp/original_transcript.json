    " Yes, the lag is expected during collaborative task execution! Let me explain what's happening:\n\nTechnical Explanation:\nThe system is making multiple sequential API calls to GPT-4 and GPT-3.5:\n1. First call: Task decomposition (GPT-4 breaks down the task)\n2. Subsequent calls: One for each subtask execution\n3. Final call: Result combination/synthesis\n\nEach API call has:\n- Network latency (round trip to OpenAI's servers)\n- Queue/processing time on OpenAI's end\n- Token processing time (especially for GPT-4)\n\nLayman's Terms:\nThink of it like a project manager:\n1. First, they read the big task and break it into smaller pieces (takes time to think it through)\n2. Then they assign each piece to the right person (different AI models)\n3. Each person has to do their part (each takes time)\n4. Finally, someone combines all the work into one cohesive result\n\nWe could optimize this by:\n1. Implementing parallel processing for subtasks\n2. Adding caching for similar requests\n3. Streaming partial results as they come in\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these optimizations? The parallel processing would likely give us the biggest speed improvement."
