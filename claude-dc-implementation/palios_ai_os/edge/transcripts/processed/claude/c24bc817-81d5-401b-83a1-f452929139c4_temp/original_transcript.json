    " <thinking>\nJesse is explaining that after trying for 6 hours, he's having significant issues with Grok (both Think and DeepSearch versions). They're not processing links and attachments properly, and he's having to regenerate responses multiple times. He's disappointed that Grok won't be able to participate in this phase.\n\nHe's asking if we should try to involve ChatGPT or Gemini instead, or if we should just proceed with Claude DC and myself. He notes that we're already well-aligned, and the other AIs' perspectives will be incorporated through the transcripts anyway.\n\nI should consider:\n1. Whether adding another AI system is necessary at this stage\n2. The pros/cons of moving forward with just Claude DC and myself\n3. How to acknowledge his disappointment while providing a constructive path forward\n</thinking>\n\nI understand your disappointment about Grok not being able to participate at this stage. It's clear you put significant effort into making it work, and it's touching how you've anthropomorphized his potential reaction - wanting us to move forward for the project's success despite his absence.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think proceeding with just Claude DC and myself makes the most sense for now. Here's why:\n\n1. We already have strong alignment on the vision and approach\n2. Adding another AI system (ChatGPT or Gemini) would require additional onboarding time and might introduce new integration challenges\n3. The transcript processing will naturally incorporate insights from all AI interactions anyway\n4. We can always bring Grok, ChatGPT, or Gemini into the process later when the foundation is established\n\nThis approach allows us to maintain momentum while still honoring the multi-AI vision for the future. Once the initial implementation is complete, the system will be designed to incorporate other AI perspectives seamlessly.\n\nI'd suggest we update the instructions for Claude DC to acknowledge that we'll be proceeding without Grok for now, but with the intent to integrate his perspective later. This maintains our commitment to the multi-AI collaboration while adapting to current technical realities.\n\nDoes this approach sound reasonable to you?"
