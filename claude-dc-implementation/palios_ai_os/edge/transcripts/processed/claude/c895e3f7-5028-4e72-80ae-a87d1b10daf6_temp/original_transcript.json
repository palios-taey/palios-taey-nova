    " Great! The tests ran successfully with 10 tests passing and 2 skipped. This shows that our core functionality is working as expected. Let me analyze the results:\n\n1. **Test Results Overview**:\n   - All 10 executed tests passed successfully\n   - 2 tests were skipped due to unavailable components\n   - Total test execution time: 1.55 seconds\n\n2. **Component Status**:\n   - **Working Components**: Model registry, task decomposition, task execution, model routing\n   - **Unavailable Components**: Memory system, transcript processor\n\n3. **Specific Test Results**:\n   - System health check: Passed\n   - Model operations: All passed (listing models, getting suggestions)\n   - Task operations: All passed (submitting, status checking, executing, decomposing)\n   - System status: Passed\n\nThe server logs show why certain components were unavailable:\n- Memory system: Missing `create_memory_system` function in memory_service.py\n- Transcript processor: Indentation error on line 418\n\nDespite these issues, the system is demonstrating graceful degradation, continuing to operate with the available components. This aligns with our design goal of robustness through component independence.\n\nNext steps:\n\n1. **Fix the unavailable components**:\n   - Add the missing `create_memory_system` function to memory_service.py\n   - Fix the indentation error in transcript_processor.py\n\n2. **Document the verification results**:\n   - Update the implementation tracker with the test results\n   - Document which components are working and which need fixes\n\n3. **Prepare documentation**:\n   - Deployment guide that includes component setup\n   - API usage examples focused on the working endpoints\n\nThe test results validate our approach to graceful degradation and robust error handling. Even with two components unavailable, the system continues to function effectively with the rest."
