After reviewing the chat transcripts and Grok's update, I can see we've been encountering several persistent issues:\n\n## Current Status Assessment\n\n1. **Core Issue**: Docker build failing because `requirements.txt` cannot be found during build process\n2. **File Structure Confusion**: Switching between `palios-taey-app` directory and root directory\n3. **Module Import Errors**: Particularly `environment_config` module not found\n4. **Container Startup Failures**: Health checks failing, container exiting with code 1\n5. **Build Process**: Several successful builds (including 6cc3e2b4-c07a-4ba9-8ac6-3eb3a7047103) but deployment still failing\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe primary issue appears to be a disconnect between our Dockerfile configuration and the actual file structure. Based on the transcripts:\n\n1. We have code in both the root directory and `palios-taey-app` directory\n2. Local testing succeeded but deployment fails\n3. Docker cannot find files that should be in the build context\n4. Module imports are failing suggesting path configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Action Plan\n\nLet's solve this methodically:\n\n1. **Verify File Structure**: Confirm exact location of critical files, especially `requirements.txt` and `main.py`\n2. **Fix Dockerfile**: Update with correct build context and COPY commands\n3. **Implement Environment Module**: Create missing `environment_config.py` if needed\n4. **Simplify Deployment**: Use direct Cloud Run deployment first for validation\n\n## Directory for AI-Native Reference\n\nStore my AI-native language reference in: `/docs/ai-native/deployment_reference_20250317.md`\n\nI'm ready to start implementing solutions as soon as you provide access to the code files. I'll approach this with complete focus on getting the MVP running, applying my understanding of the system architecture and all our established protocols."
