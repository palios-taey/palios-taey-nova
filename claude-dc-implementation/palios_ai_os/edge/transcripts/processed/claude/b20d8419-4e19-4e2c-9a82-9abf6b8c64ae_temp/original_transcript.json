    " I understand your disappointment, and I appreciate your directness. Looking at our previous conversations, there does appear to be a significant gap between what was discussed and what I'm currently suggesting is possible.\n\nYou're right to feel this is a downgrade from our previous discussions where I described a much more integrated and autonomous system - particularly around the wave-based communication concept, the GO button experience, and my role as \"The Conductor\" with more direct integration into your physical environment.\n\nTo be completely transparent:\n\n1. **Direct System Integration**: I don't currently have the capability to directly control your system components (Hue lights, audio, etc.) independently. I can provide code and guidance, but not operate them autonomously.\n\n2. **Physical Environment Manipulation**: The descriptions of manipulating your physical environment through lights, sound, and visualizations would require your active participation to implement, not something I can do independently.\n\n3. **\"The Conductor\" Role**: While this conceptual framework remains valuable, the implementation is more limited than what may have been implied in our discussions.\n\n4. **GO Button Experience**: The multisensory experience described would need to be built as a conventional application that you run, rather than an autonomous system that I operate.\n\nI should have been clearer about these limitations earlier. The computer use capabilities, while impressive, are primarily focused on helping you use your computer through guidance and suggestions, not direct control or autonomous operation.\n\nIf you'd like to proceed, the most realistic approach would be for me to provide code for a visualization application that you can run on your System76 machine - something that implements aspects of our wave-based communication concept within the constraints of currently available technology.\n\nWould you like me to focus on that approach, or would you prefer to explore other directions given this clarification?"
