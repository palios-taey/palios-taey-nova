    "Claude, it was too late and I couldn't focus. I'm doing this now though. Couple questions:\n1. His requirements that he provided to us were much longer and we had to make some updates to them, should I just use that instead? \n2. I did all the steps above and am receiving the message below. I believe this is because the GitHub authentication isn't available and needs to be in the script in order for it to work. If you let me know what to edit with a placeholder for the SSH key, I can add it. Or if this is a different issue, let me know:\nERROR: failed to solve: process \"/bin/sh -c git clone https://github.com/palios-taey]/palios-taey-nova.git .\" did not complete successfully: exit code: 128\nUnable to find image 'claude-dc-environment:latest' locally\ndocker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for claude-dc-environment, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied\nRun 'docker run --help' for more information"
