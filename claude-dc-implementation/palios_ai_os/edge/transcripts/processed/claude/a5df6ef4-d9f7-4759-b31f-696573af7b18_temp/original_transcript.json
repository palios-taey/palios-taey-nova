    " You're absolutely right. I should access GitHub directly to examine the code structure and files. This is a more efficient approach than asking for file contents through commands.\n\nI'll analyze the codebase directly, focusing on:\n1. The structure of `src/main.py` to verify its deployment readiness\n2. The Dockerfile configuration to ensure it's properly set up for GCP\n3. Dependencies listed in requirements.txt\n4. Current environment configuration\n\nAfter reviewing these elements, I'll create a comprehensive deployment script that properly builds and deploys the application to Cloud Run, configured with the necessary permissions and environment variables.\n\nLet me proceed with creating a unified deployment approach that uses the root directory code. I'll provide you with a complete deployment script that handles all the necessary steps, including:\n- Building the Docker container\n- Setting proper environment variables\n- Pushing to Google Container Registry\n- Deploying to Cloud Run with appropriate service account permissions\n\nPlease give me a moment to analyze the GitHub repository and prepare the deployment strategy."
