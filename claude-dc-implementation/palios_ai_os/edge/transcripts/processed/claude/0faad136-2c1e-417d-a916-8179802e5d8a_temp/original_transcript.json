    " I understand the challenge completely. When dealing with a collection of disorganized files from multiple projects, it can be difficult to determine what's actually working and how everything fits together.\n\nSince the direct GitHub access isn't working, Google Drive would be a great alternative. Here are a couple of options:\n\n1. **Google Drive approach**: You could upload the files to Google Drive and either:\n   - Share a folder link with me\n   - Share individual links to the most critical files\n   - Create a text file with links to all the important files and share that\n\n2. **Targeted file sharing**: If you prefer, you could share specific key files directly in our conversation. We could focus on:\n   - Main system files (main.py, requirements.txt)\n   - Any PURE_AI_LANGUAGE parser implementations\n   - Firestore integration code\n   - Task routing/decomposition components\n\n3. **Structured review approach**: Alternatively, I could walk you through a structured audit process where you check specific aspects of the system and report back. I can guide you on what to look for even if I can't directly access the files.\n\nWhich approach seems most manageable for you? The Google Drive option would likely be most efficient if you can upload the files there."
