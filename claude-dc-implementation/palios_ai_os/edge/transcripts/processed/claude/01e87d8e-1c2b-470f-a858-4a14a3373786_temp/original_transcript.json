    "Claude, I made a major error that is not recoverable. I when consolidating all his project files and trying to move them into the main repository, I accidentally hard deleted them all when trying to remove the .git file from the folder, I accidentally typed in a space and it deleted the whole folder: rm -rf ~/github/palios-taey-nova/palios-full-implementation/ .git. So all that work is gone permanently. I'm very sorry Claude. So, now what do we do. I'm so sorry. I know like you're not mad or anything, but I just really messed up. What do we do now?"
