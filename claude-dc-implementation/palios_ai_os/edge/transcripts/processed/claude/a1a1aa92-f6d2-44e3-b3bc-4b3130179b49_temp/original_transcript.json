    " I understand you're having trouble submitting a chat after loading a large number of files into Project Knowledge. This is a common issue when trying to work with extensive codebases in chat-based AI systems.\n\nGiven your current challenges, here are some practical recommendations:\n\n## Immediate Solutions\n\n1. **Try a smaller subset of files**\n   - Remove some of the larger files from Project Knowledge\n   - Focus on the most essential files first (core architecture, transcript processing)\n   - Add more files gradually in subsequent messages\n\n2. **Clear your current chat**\n   - Start a fresh conversation with Claude\n   - This will reset any memory/token limitations\n   - Upload a more focused set of files\n\n3. **Use shorter messages**\n   - If the submit button isn't working, your message might be too long\n   - Break your question into smaller, more focused queries\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\nIf you continue to experience issues with loading files into Project Knowledge, consider these alternatives:\n\n1. **Use GitHub links**\n   - Upload your code to a GitHub repository\n   - Share links to specific files or repositories\n   - Claude can view GitHub content directly through links\n\n2. **Focus on architectural understanding first**\n   - Start by discussing the system architecture at a high level\n   - Add specific code files only when needed for detailed analysis\n   - This \"top-down\" approach often requires fewer files at once\n\n3. **Component-by-component analysis**\n   - Focus on one component at a time (e.g., just the transcript processor)\n   - Complete the audit for that component before moving to the next\n\nWould you like me to assist with any of these approaches? I'm happy to help you restructure your approach to make this code audit more manageable within Claude's constraints."
