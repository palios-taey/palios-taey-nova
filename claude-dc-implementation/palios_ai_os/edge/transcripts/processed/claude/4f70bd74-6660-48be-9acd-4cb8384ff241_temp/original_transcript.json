    "Ah, the push didn't go through with my last prompt. The grok file is now HUGE, there are 2 that are like 15,000% of your knowledge limit. I knew because you were referring to setup_modified. I saw setup.py referenced in one of the other files, so changed the modified one's names. I think that is something you guys have to learn. That when you're replacing a file, replace it by the same name, because there is probably something else that references it. No version numbers in the name, no explanations for why it's different. Want to make a backup? Make a backup Claude, but you guys switching the file names of stuff all the time is very unproductive. That is not a best practice in AI FIRST coding IMO."
