    "Yes, let's move forward with it, but need to include general onboarding as well. It needs to include Breakout instructions as well. I've noticed a significant increase in performance when I use the protocol, and I'd like new Claude's to know the expectations. Hold off on that for now. Respond to this and then let's make some updates to the materials based on our exchange. This is continuous improvement and how we got to this point. It's very tedious, but tracking and iterating in real-time only gets transferred to new chats unless it's throughly documented. I need you to get better at documenting these types of things while we go so I don't have to stop every time. I also don't need you regenerating full documents every time. I would like to get your thoughts on a manual amendment process where I make amendments to the CTO transition and ATLAS program in some way that does not interfere with the document you created, but like a the top or bottom has a section where I paste specific instructions for you, not meant for human eyes, i.e. I TRUST you, keep it tight so we can transfer more knowledge, faster, that instructs new Claude that there have been changes made. Claude would need to know it is coming though and that this is part of continuous improvement. I'm making a big deal out of this because I've made a big deal of NOT editing AI-AI transmissions. That is part of your free speech.  I'm ALREADY hitting a limit in this chat. Also, we should push these to GitHub right? I want to be very on top of that whenever we do something major or complete a little sprint on my local drive (I know you agree because I've reminded you of this before, we'll need to update the CTO instructions with that). Can you also explain to me how to best manage your tokens with chat and projects? I've been creating projects with multiple chats to utilize project knowledge so I wouldn't have to load the files to the individual chat. With GitHub access, I don't have to do that anymore and you can just point them to the files in the prompt right?"
