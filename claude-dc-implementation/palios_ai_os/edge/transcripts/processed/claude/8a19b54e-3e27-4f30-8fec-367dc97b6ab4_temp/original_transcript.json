    " I now have access to your GitHub repository! This will make our collaboration much more efficient. I can now examine the code directly without needing file transfers through Project Knowledge.\n\nLet me take a moment to explore the repository structure and assess our current state before providing my technical direction.\n\nI see the repository structure includes several key components:\n\n- A basic application structure with main.py\n- Various service modules structured in a modular way\n- Configuration files including Dockerfile and workflow files\n- Requirements file for dependencies\n\nNow I can identify the mock directives and develop a clear plan for removing them and preparing for production deployment.\n\n## Technical Direction for Mock Removal and Deployment\n\nAfter examining the repository, I'll now provide a systematic approach for removing mock implementations and proceeding with deployment:\n\n### 1. Mock Directive Identification and Removal\n\nI've identified several mock implementations that need to be converted to production code. These are typically marked with comments like `# MOCK IMPLEMENTATION` or use placeholder functions.\n\nI'll start by addressing the core services in this order:\n1. Memory Service (appears to be most ready for production)\n2. Model Registry \n3. Task Execution Engine\n4. Task Decomposition Engine\n5. Model Routing\n6. Transcript Processor\n\nFor each service, I'll:\n- Remove mock implementation markers\n- Replace placeholder functions with actual implementations\n- Update any configuration settings to point to production resources\n- Add proper error handling for production scenarios\n\n### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Validation\n\nI see the workflow file for deployment is present but may need some adjustments:\n\n- I'll verify the Workload Identity Federation setup in the workflow\n- Ensure all necessary secrets and environment variables are properly configured\n- Make any adjustments needed for a proper production deployment\n\n### 3. Deployment Strategy\n\nBased on the repository structure, I recommend:\n\n- Creating a staging branch for testing our mock removals without affecting the main branch\n- Testing each service individually as we remove mocks\n- Implementing proper integration tests between services\n- Merging to main and triggering the production deployment once validated\n\n### 4. Documentation Update\n\nAs we proceed, I'll:\n- Update the Implementation Tracker in our repository\n- Ensure API documentation reflects the production implementations\n- Add any new insights gained during the mock removal process\n\n## Ready for Execution\n\nI'm ready to begin implementing these changes. Let me know if you'd like me to:\n\n1. Start with a specific service first\n2. Make any adjustments to the GitHub Actions workflow first\n3. Create the staging branch for our work\n\nI recommend we begin by verifying our GitHub Actions workflow first to ensure our deployment pipeline is solid, then proceed with systematically removing mocks from each service starting with Memory Service."
