    " ## Information Needs\nNow I understand what happened. We have two pools created during our attempts.\n\n## Technical Direction\nLet's use the \"github-actions-pool\" which matches our current instructions and delete \"github-pool\" to avoid confusion.\n\n## Action Items - Ready for Execution\n\n1. Delete the unused pool:\n   - In the Google Cloud Console, select \"github-pool\"\n   - Click \"DELETE\" and confirm\n\n2. Continue with creating the provider for \"github-actions-pool\" as outlined in my previous instructions.\n\n3. After creating the provider, run these commands to confirm and set up the binding:\n\n```bash\n# Verify the provider was created\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers describe \"github-provider\" \\\n  --project=\"ai-execution-system\" \\\n  --location=\"global\" \\\n  --workload-identity-pool=\"github-actions-pool\" \\\n  --format=\"value(name)\"\n\n# Configure the service account binding\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \"github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" \\\n  --project=\"ai-execution-system\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser\" \\\n  --member=\"principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/711898853198/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions-pool/attribute.repository=palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\"\n```\n\nOnce the provider is created and verified, I'll prepare the GitHub Actions workflow file."
