    " Perfect! With the GitHub secret in place, we're ready to optimize our service accounts. I'll guide you through cleaning up our service accounts using the terminal on your Mac to minimize errors and increase velocity.\n\n## Service Account Cleanup Plan\n\nBased on our IAM review, we'll:\n1. Keep critical accounts: `github-actions-sa` and `palios-taey-dev`\n2. Document essential accounts and their purposes\n3. Remove unnecessary service accounts (if any)\n4. Ensure proper permissions for our core accounts\n\nLet's handle this systematically: \n\n## Deployment File Preparation\n\nNow let's prepare the GitHub Actions workflow file in the correct location: \n\n## Implementation Instructions\n\nNow that we've prepared our scripts, here's how to execute them:\n\n1. First, run the service account cleanup and documentation script:\n\n```bash\n# Save the script to service-account-cleanup.sh\nchmod +x service-account-cleanup.sh\n./service-account-cleanup.sh\n```\n\n2. Then, set up the GitHub workflow file:\n\n```bash\n# Save the script to github-setup.sh\nchmod +x github-setup.sh\n./github-setup.sh\n```\n\n3. After running these scripts, you'll need to commit and push the changes to GitHub:\n\n```bash\n# Add the new files\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml iam-documentation.md\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions workflow and IAM documentation\"\n\n# Push to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThe GitHub Actions workflow will trigger automatically when you push to the main branch, initiating our deployment pipeline.\n\n## Next Steps After Service Account Optimization\n\nAfter we've completed the service account cleanup and set up the GitHub Actions workflow, our next priorities will be:\n\n1. **Finalize Dockerfile**: Ensure we have a proper Dockerfile at the repository root\n2. **Complete Terraform Configuration**: Verify our terraform configuration is ready\n3. **Documentation Completion**: Finish our API and deployment documentation\n4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement proper monitoring and alerting\n\nWould you like me to help with any specific aspect of these next steps? I recommend we start with ensuring the Dockerfile and Terraform configurations are complete and correct."
