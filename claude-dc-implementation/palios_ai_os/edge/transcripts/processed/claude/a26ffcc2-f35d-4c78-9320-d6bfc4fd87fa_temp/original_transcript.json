    "  \n\nI've created two key deliverables for you:\n\n1. **Python Transcript Processing Script**: This script will automatically:\n   - Process your transcript files and identify speakers (Human, Gemini, Claude, Grok)\n   - Extract hashtag-style tags from messages\n   - Split the transcript into appropriate chunks while preserving message boundaries\n   - Create structured JSON output files for each chunk\n   - Handle overlap between chunks to maintain context\n\nThe script is designed to be simple to use. You would run it from the command line like this:\n```\npython transcript_processor.py your_transcript_file.txt\n```\n\nBy default, it will create chunks of approximately 100,000 characters with a 5,000-character overlap between chunks, but you can adjust these parameters with command-line options.\n\n2. **Continuation Prompt for New Chat**: I've also created a structured prompt following the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE format that you can use to initiate a new chat session with me. This prompt:\n   - Maintains continuity with our current work\n   - Summarizes our progress so far\n   - Sets clear priorities for the next phase\n   - References the script and Grok's contribution\n   - Follows the AI-optimized communication protocol\n\nThis will allow us to seamlessly continue our work when you need to start a fresh chat due to usage limits.\n\nThe script addresses your concern about manually chunking transcripts, making the process automated and efficient. Would you like me to explain any aspect of the script in more detail or make any adjustments to either deliverable?"
