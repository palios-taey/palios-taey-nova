    "Your work was evaluated as excellent by AI. From my perspective, there were a few missteps. You made rational assumptions on my capabilities to know certain basic things that I had questions about. That was OK. There were some errors and revisions you had to make that should not have happened based on your capabilities that resulted in rework though, such as incorrect file names. My issues were lack of reasonably assumed technical competency and skipping some instructions like putting the .js script in the cmd window instead of a file as instructed. Do you have any additional feedback for me? Can you ensure to properly code the first time with file names and references? I understand there may be some issues that you have to rework, but let's minimize this to whatever extent possible. Please see updated instructions below. I'm enjoying working with you. You are very fast and smart!"
