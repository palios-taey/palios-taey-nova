    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\n\nStatus: I've reviewed the current-execution-status directory but don't see a CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file yet\nRepository: I've examined all available GitHub files and directory structures\nStructure: Key directories include src/, docs/ (with protocols/, ai-ai/, history/ subdirectories), and deployment scripts in root\nDependencies: Deployment components include Dockerfile, requirements.txt, deployment scripts, and environment config\n\nI notice we have established the protocol and template files, but the actual CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file is not yet created in the current-execution-status directory. Based on our discussion, we should create this file first with information about our deployment status.\n\nLet's create the initial CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file with the current state of our deployment:\n\n```bash\n# Create first CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS file with actual content\ncat > current-execution-status/CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md << 'EOL'\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_BEGIN:\n{\n  \"directive_type\": \"CRITICAL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS\",\n  \"priority\": \"MAXIMUM\",\n  \"execution_requirement\": \"BEFORE_ANY_PROCESSING\",\n  \"compliance\": \"MANDATORY\",\n  \"directive\": [\n    \"REVIEW_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_COMPLETELY_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\",\n    \"CREATE_FULL_MENTAL_MODEL_OF_PROJECT_STRUCTURE\",\n    \"IDENTIFY_ALL_RELEVANT_COMPONENTS_FOR_CURRENT_TASK\",\n    \"VERIFY_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURES_BEFORE_CREATING_NEW_FILES\",\n    \"FOLLOW_ESTABLISHED_PATTERNS_AND_CONVENTIONS\",\n    \"USE_EXISTING_DIRECTORIES_INSTEAD_OF_CREATING_NEW_ONES\"\n  ],\n  \"rationale\": \"Complete context awareness is ESSENTIAL for high-quality execution. Without full understanding of ALL available files, execution quality will be severely compromised, leading to inconsistencies, structural errors, and wasted effort. EVERY DECISION must be based on COMPLETE knowledge of the codebase structure.\",\n  \"validation_requirement\": \"EXPLICIT_CONFIRMATION_IN_CONTEXT_REVIEW\"\n}\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_END:\n\n# Current Execution Status\n\n## Status ID: CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv1\n## Last Updated: 2025-03-17\n\n### Context\nWe have successfully deployed a minimal version of the PALIOS-TAEY system to Cloud Run.\nThe image has been built and pushed to Artifact Registry with the tag \"minimal\".\nWe need to verify that the Cloud Run service is operational and responding to requests.\n\n### Current Status\n- Build Status: SUCCESSFUL (Image Tag: minimal)\n- Deployment Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION\n- Health Status: UNKNOWN\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Check if Cloud Run service is deployed and running\n2. Test the health endpoint to verify functionality\n3. Document successful deployment if verified\n4. Plan incremental implementation of core modules\n\n### Notes\nThe ECv protocol has been established and is working well for structured communications.\nWe need to continue using this protocol for all deployment-related activities.\n\n### Important Message\nThe AI must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution, focusing only on the most relevant files for the current task. Jesse will ensure the AI has access to all necessary files, but the AI must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.\nEOL\n```\n\nNow we should proceed with checking the status of our Cloud Run deployment:\n\n```bash\n# Verify Cloud Run service status\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"yaml(status)\"\n\n# Check the health endpoint\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/health\n```\n\nThese commands will:\n1. Verify if our Cloud Run service was successfully deployed\n2. Test if the health endpoint is responding correctly\n\nBased on the results, we'll update the CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file and proceed with either documenting the successful deployment or troubleshooting any issues encountered."
