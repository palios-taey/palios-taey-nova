    " I'll dive right into completing the PALIOS-TAEY MVP, building on the existing components and adding the missing pieces. Let me analyze what we have and what needs to be done.\n\nLooking at the project knowledge files, I can see we have a solid foundation with the memory service and transcript processor implementation, but several components are still needed to complete the MVP as defined in our original scope plus enhancements.\n\nLet me start by implementing the missing components in a systematic way, prioritizing the ones needed for a complete end-to-end system that can be deployed to GCP.\n\nFirst, I'll need to create the missing components:\n1. Dynamic Model Registry\n2. Task Execution Engine\n3. Task Decomposition\n4. Model Routing\n5. GCP Deployment Configuration with Terraform\n\nLet's begin with the Dynamic Model Registry, which is crucial for the AI orchestration capabilities: \n\nNow let's implement the Task Decomposition engine, which will break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks:"
