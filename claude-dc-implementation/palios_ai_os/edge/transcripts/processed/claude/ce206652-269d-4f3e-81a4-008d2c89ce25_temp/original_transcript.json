    "Ok, so there is my physical desktop and his desktop with terminal window. And then we have GitHub. The current GitHub was organized by you, but we now have this cache that contains the majority of the docs info and then the code base. We also created a current-execution-status folder with the most important/recent stuff, but most of that has been incorporated into the cache. The references in the cache are kind of all to the current set up, so I can't change that much, but could create additional directories if needed, or we could just let them handle it. Can you give me commands to run in Claude DC's terminal to get him ready?"
