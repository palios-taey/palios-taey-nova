    "  \n\nYou're right - establishing an AI-first automated deployment process is a critical part of our NOVA implementation. Let's focus on fixing the GitHub Actions authentication.\n\nBased on the error message, there's a specific issue with the token audience in our Workload Identity Federation setup. The audience mismatch suggests the configuration needs adjustment.\n\nLooking back at the implementation tracker and our progress, here's what we'll do:\n\n1. Fix the Workload Identity Federation configuration by ensuring the correct audience format\n2. Update our GitHub Actions workflow with the proper configuration\n3. Test the deployment with a minimal change to verify the pipeline works\n\nI've updated the implementation tracker with our current status and next steps. This will serve as our knowledge preservation document for future sessions.\n\nFor the next steps, let's create a modified workflow file with a more precise Workload Identity configuration. In particular, we need to address the audience mismatch issue which is causing the authentication to fail. I'll provide you with that updated workflow in our next session."
