    "Ok, I couldn't get the scripts to work to update in the terminal, but I did manually. I appreciate you trying to do that though. I'm not sure the exact steps to take to do that properly. I'm no longer able to open main.tf. I get an error saying: \"Apple could not verify \u201cmain.tf\u201d is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.\" and then it asks me if I want to move it to trash. Do you know how to fix this?"
