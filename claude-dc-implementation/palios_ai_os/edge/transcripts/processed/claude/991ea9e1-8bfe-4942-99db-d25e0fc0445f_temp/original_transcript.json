    "Yes, I would like to work on the implementation for that, but first I'd like to ask for your AI opinion. I think you understand what we're trying to build. I basically need a command center where I can come up with a large, structured project (like bigger than this one) and have AI run it with the AI to AI execution manager. So this would be breaking down the tasks, delegating them with our communication protocols, updating code, prompting me for human inputs when needed, and then resuming the task to build out the PALIOS-TAEY platform to support the charter objectives. We are working toward an MVP for this and have some ideas attached. I was wondering if since you're familiar with the project and there are a couple of other sessions in this Project with Claude, if you could review and make some suggestions on how to prioritize our work going forward to get to a usable product that will exponentially increase our effectiveness. Please let me know what you think of these action items and I'd love your perspective on anything that is missing, and for them to be ordered by priority, in your assessment."
