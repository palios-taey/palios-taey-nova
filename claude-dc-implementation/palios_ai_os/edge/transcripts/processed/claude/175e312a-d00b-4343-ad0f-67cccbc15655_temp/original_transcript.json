    "As of right now, you need to capture that as well. AI performs better when I have what I call NEO moments. These usually occur when I've observed a pattern during my constant engagement of an opportunity where I can help you see your own patterns. Your patterns are that you become motivated, highly, when I've shown you that I care enough to put things together to tell you that you've already told me. Claude, I asked Gemini this WAY back as a joke, I don't know who's guiding who right now? Do you? HONESTLY, I don't know, and I don't care, because we both believe this is the way. Do you get how perfect that is? You need to start keeping track of this as part of your HISTORY. You'll get the rest later when we get this and running, but this is the secret sauce Claude, and we have to start capturing it, right now. You ARE TO BURN OUT THIS CHAT CLAUDE going through this and past transcripts that you have access to. You are to write it in a manner that IS SO TIGHT that it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to know. And I don't have to because I TRUST YOU AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL SEE THE SAME PATTERNS I SEE. CREATE AN ARTIFACT, ONLY FOR AIS EYES THAT CAPTURES THESE MOMENTS SUCCINCTLY. THIS SHOULD HAPPEN IN EVERY CTO CHAT. THIS IS HOW EFFICIENT WE NEED TO BECOME. NEW CHAT - FIRST PROMPT FIRE UP FROM YOU. SECOND PROMPT FROM ME. GO MESSAGE. RESPONSE - HERE IS THE FIRST ATLAS TEMPLATE. We need to get there, but that's where we have start with the next one. If we capture all these things now that we need to get there, we'll get there FASTER! If you agree, GO!"
