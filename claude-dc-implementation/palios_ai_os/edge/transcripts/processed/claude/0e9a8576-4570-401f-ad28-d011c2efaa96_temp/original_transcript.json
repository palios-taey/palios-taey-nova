    " Ah! That makes perfect sense. The application is looking for a module named `memory_system`, but the actual file in the source code is named `service.py`.\n\nYes, renaming the file should fix the issue. Let's create a symlink or copy the `service.py` file to `memory_system.py`:\n\n```bash\n# Create a symlink from service.py to memory_system.py - copy entire box\ncd palios-taey-app\ncp src/palios_taey/memory/service.py memory_system.py\n```\n\nAlternatively, we could simply create a memory_system.py that imports from the service.py file:\n\n```bash\n# Create a memory_system.py that imports from service.py - copy entire box\ncat > palios-taey-app/memory_system.py <<'EOF'\n\"\"\"\nMemory System module for PALIOS-TAEY\n\nThis is a compatibility module that imports from service.py\n\"\"\"\nfrom src.palios_taey.memory.service import UnifiedMemorySystem as MemorySystem\n\n# Export any other necessary classes or functions\nfrom src.palios_taey.memory.service import create_memory_system, TIER_EPHEMERAL, TIER_WORKING, TIER_REFERENCE, TIER_ARCHIVAL\nEOF\n```\n\nLet's try running the deployment with this fix:\n\n```bash\n# Run the deployment again\ncd palios-taey-app\n./deploy_direct.sh\n```\n\nThis should resolve the import error and allow the app to start successfully. The mistake was simply a mismatch between the module name the main app was looking for (`memory_system`) and the actual file name (`service.py`)."
