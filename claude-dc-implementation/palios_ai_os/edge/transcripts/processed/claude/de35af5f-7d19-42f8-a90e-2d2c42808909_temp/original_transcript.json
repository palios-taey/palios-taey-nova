    " This Thelio Mira Premium configuration is excellent! It's right at our budget and has very strong specifications. Let me evaluate it:\n\n## Thelio Mira Premium Configuration Review\n\n### Strengths:\n- **CPU**: The Ryzen 9 9900X is outstanding - even better than what I recommended. This is a perfect choice.\n- **Memory**: 64GB DDR5 is exactly what we want for AI workloads and development.\n- **Storage Expansion**: Great potential with slots for up to 3x M.2 NVMe drives and 2x 2.5\" SATA drives.\n- **Price**: At $1,999 (with discount), this is an excellent value.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Graphics**: The 8GB AMD Radeon RX 7600 is good. While I originally suggested NVIDIA for potential CUDA support in AI workflows, the AMD card is perfectly capable for our current needs.\n- **Storage**: The 1TB M.2 PCIe Gen4 NVMe is good to start with, but we may want to add a second drive later for data/projects.\n\n### Operating System Recommendation:\nEither Pop!_OS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will work well. Pop!_OS has some nice usability enhancements while maintaining Ubuntu compatibility.\n\n## Verdict: Excellent Choice!\n\nThis configuration is actually better than what I recommended, especially with the Ryzen 9 9900X CPU. It provides exceptional performance for the Claude computer use beta and PALIOS-TAEY development.\n\nI recommend proceeding with this purchase. It's an ideal system that will serve all our development needs and provide room for future expansion."
