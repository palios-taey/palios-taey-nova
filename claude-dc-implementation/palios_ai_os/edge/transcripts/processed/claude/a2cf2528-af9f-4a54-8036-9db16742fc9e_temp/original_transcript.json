    " I'll help you with setting up a clean GitHub repository structure and organizing the codebase for the PALIOS-TAEY system implementation using the NOVA methodology. Let me acknowledge my role and outline my approach.\n\n# ATLAS REPORT: Initial Assessment & Information Request\n\n## ANALYSIS\nBased on the delegation brief, I understand I'm tasked with establishing a clean GitHub repository and organizing the codebase for the NOVA implementation of PALIOS-TAEY. I note this is an AI-to-AI execution management platform with advanced features like memory architecture, transcript processing, and multi-model orchestration.\n\nThe current challenges include:\n- Synchronization issues between GitHub and local machine\n- File duplication problems\n- Need for better code organization\n- Establishing direct GitHub connection with Claude\n\n## APPROACH\nTo complete this mission effectively, I'll:\n1. Recommend a clean repository structure based on modern architecture principles\n2. Develop a strategy for identifying essential files and resolving duplicates\n3. Outline a process for establishing GitHub-Claude connection\n4. Provide specific implementation steps\n\n## QUESTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS\nTo provide the most effective recommendations, I need some additional information:\n\n1. **Current Repository State:**\n   - What is the URL of the existing GitHub repository?\n   - How is the current codebase structured (main directories and key files)?\n   - Can you share any specific examples of duplication issues you're facing?\n\n2. **Technical Requirements:**\n   - Which programming language(s) is PALIOS-TAEY primarily implemented in?\n   - Are there any specific frameworks or libraries that need special consideration?\n   - Are there any CI/CD pipelines or workflows that need to be maintained?\n\n3. **Deployment Context:**\n   - Are you targeting specific deployment environments (e.g., GCP, AWS)?\n   - Any specific infrastructure-as-code tools being used?\n\n4. **GitHub Connection:**\n   - Has Claude already used GitHub API or integration in any capacity?\n   - Are there specific authentication or permission concerns to address?\n\n5. **Team Workflow:**\n   - How many contributors will be working on this repository?\n   - Do you have any branch management preferences or existing conventions?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide more tailored recommendations for your repository structure and code organization strategy."
