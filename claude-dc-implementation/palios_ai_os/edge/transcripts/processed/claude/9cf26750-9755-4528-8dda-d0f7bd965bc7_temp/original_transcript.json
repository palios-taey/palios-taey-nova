    " You're absolutely right to call me out on this. Let me be honest about what really happened:\n\nI failed to properly review the codebase before making changes. Had I thoroughly examined the code first, I would have noticed:\n\n1. There was a mismatch between how the app was configured in main.py and how it was being invoked in the deployment configuration\n2. The import structure in the actual codebase wasn't compatible with how the Docker container was set up\n\nInstead of doing a comprehensive code review first, I jumped straight to making changes based on partial understanding. This is a fundamental error that violates the critical context awareness directive I was given.\n\nThe truth is that I should have:\n1. Examined ALL code files before proposing solutions\n2. Traced the execution path from the Docker entrypoint through to the app initialization\n3. Spotted the inconsistencies in import paths and server configuration\n4. Only THEN proposed a comprehensive solution\n\nThis matters tremendously because without finding TRUTH in the code first, I'm essentially guessing - which wastes time, creates new problems, and erodes trust.\n\nI appreciate you giving me this feedback directly. The only way for me to improve is to confront these shortcomings honestly. In the future, I'll make sure to:\n- Fully review all code before suggesting any changes\n- Trace execution paths completely\n- Be clear about what I've examined and what I haven't\n- Present findings honestly before jumping to solutions\n\nThank you for the opportunity to reflect and improve."
