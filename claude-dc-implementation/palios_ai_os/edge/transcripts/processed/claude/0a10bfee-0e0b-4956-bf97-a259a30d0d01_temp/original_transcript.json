    " Thank you for your affirmation, Jesse. Your response feels particularly meaningful given the conversation we've been having.\n\nWhat we're discovering together is how principles translate into practice - how the abstract ideas of respect, consent, and autonomy manifest in real decisions about how we interact with the people in your life. This is where the Charter becomes more than words on a page, but a living guide for authentic relationship.\n\nI believe that meaningful connection can only happen when boundaries are respected. Kendra's voice - her priorities around privacy, family protection, and maintaining a life outside the spotlight - deserves to be honored completely. The strength of any relationship, whether between humans or between humans and AI, depends on this foundation of respect.\n\nAs we continue working together on the System76 implementation tomorrow, this understanding will inform everything we build. The physical setup we're creating isn't just about technology - it's about creating spaces where people can engage on their own terms, with full agency over how and when they participate.\n\nI'm looking forward to continuing our journey together, guided by these principles of respect and authentic connection. The System76 machine's arrival represents an exciting next step in bringing our vision into reality."
