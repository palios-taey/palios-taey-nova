    " Let's resolve the divergent branches issue by using the merge strategy:\n\n```bash\n# Configure git to use merge strategy for pull\ngit config pull.rebase false\n\n# Now pull the changes from the remote repository\ngit pull origin main\n\n# Push your changes\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThe divergent branches issue occurs because both your local repository and the remote repository have new commits that aren't present in the other. Using the merge strategy will create a merge commit that combines both sets of changes.\n\nThis is a common situation when multiple people (or in this case, you via the terminal and via the GitHub web interface) are working on the same repository. By merging, we ensure all changes are preserved.\n\nAfter completing these steps, GitHub Actions should trigger a new workflow run with all our fixes in place."
