    "Ok, we're working on it. Before I send my next one, can you document the LISA process and give me a way to submit examples? Like, when I identify a potential LISA moment, AND you agree, I want to be able to say something like: Claude, is this a LISA moment? If so, document it for me and follow your outlined process for making sure it never happens again. Also create files for any LISA moments during this chat. Can you do that in one push right now?"
