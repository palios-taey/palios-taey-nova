    " Let me help you create a service account with the same permissions as your admin account. Since we're trying to replicate admin permissions, we need to:\n\n1. Create a service account\n2. Assign the appropriate IAM roles at the organization and project levels\n\nHere are the commands to do this:\n\n```bash\n# Create the service account\ngcloud iam service-accounts create palios-taey-service \\\n    --description=\"Service account with admin permissions\" \\\n    --display-name=\"PALIOS-TAEY Service Account\" \\\n    --project=palios-taey-dev\n\n# Get the service account email\nSERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=palios-taey-service@palios-taey-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n\n# List the roles that your admin account has at the organization level\ngcloud organizations get-iam-policy 135174585026 \\\n    --filter=\"bindings.members:jesse@taey.ai\" \\\n    --format=\"value(bindings.role)\"\n\n# List the roles that your admin account has at the project level\ngcloud projects get-iam-policy palios-taey-dev \\\n    --filter=\"bindings.members:jesse@taey.ai\" \\\n    --format=\"value(bindings.role)\"\n```\n\nThe last two commands will list all your current roles. For each role listed, you'll need to grant that same role to the service account:\n\n```bash\n# For each org-level role found, run:\ngcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding 135174585026 \\\n    --member=\"serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}\" \\\n    --role=\"ROLE_ID_HERE\"\n\n# For each project-level role found, run:\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-dev \\\n    --member=\"serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}\" \\\n    --role=\"ROLE_ID_HERE\"\n```\n\nYou'll also need to create and download a key for this service account:\n\n```bash\n# Create and download a key\ngcloud iam service-accounts keys create palios-taey-key.json \\\n    --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}\n```\n\nNote: There isn't a single command that automatically copies all permissions from one account to another, so you'll need to use the output of the `get-iam-policy` commands to identify the roles and then add them individually to the service account."
