    "I stopped you because I didn't want you to regenerate everything, just let me know where you want the artifacts you generated saved and under what file name. We need to preserve your tokens Claude, you have to do all this in one chat! That's why we put all the work into the documentation, so you'd be fired up working with NEO, have all the info and protocols you need to LEAD to getting this implemented! Just remember to use cat commands next time and give me the directory locations with file names for the ones you created so far."
