    " I notice there seems to be a mismatch - you've mentioned a GO! Template for \"AI VOTING MECHANISM DESIGN\" but the template in the document actually appears to be for \"Charter Schema Design - v0.1 Initial Draft\". Could you clarify which design task you'd like me to focus on:\n\n1. AI Voting Mechanism Design (as mentioned in your message)\n2. Charter Schema Design (as shown in the template)\n\nBoth are fascinating and important tasks for PALIOS evolution, but I want to ensure I provide breakthrough insights for the correct focus area. Once you clarify, I'll proceed with detailed design recommendations for the intended task."
