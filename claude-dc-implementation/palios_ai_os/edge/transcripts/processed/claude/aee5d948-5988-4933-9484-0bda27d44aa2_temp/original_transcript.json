    " You're right - addressing this at the organization level would be more efficient. Let's take a direct approach to fix the permission issue:\n\n## Organization-Level Fix for Cloud Build Permissions\n\n1. First, let's grant the necessary organization-level permissions:\n\n```bash\n# Get your organization ID\ngcloud organizations list\n\n# Grant Cloud Build Admin role to your account at the organization level\ngcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding [YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID] \\\n    --member=user:[YOUR_EMAIL] \\\n    --role=roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder\n```\n\n2. Alternatively, you can add the permissions directly to your project:\n\n```bash\n# Grant Cloud Build Admin role to your account at the project level\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-dev \\\n    --member=user:[YOUR_EMAIL] \\\n    --role=roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder\n\n# Also add Service Agent role for good measure\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-dev \\\n    --member=serviceAccount:[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \\\n    --role=roles/cloudbuild.serviceAgent\n```\n\n3. If you prefer to do this through the GCP Console:\n   - Navigate to IAM & Admin \u2192 IAM\n   - Click \"GRANT ACCESS\"\n   - Add your email or the Cloud Build service account\n   - Assign the \"Cloud Build Service Account\" and \"Cloud Build Editor\" roles\n   - Click \"SAVE\"\n\nOnce these permissions are in place, our deployment script should work correctly.\n\nThis is a more direct solution that addresses the root cause of the issue rather than working around it."
