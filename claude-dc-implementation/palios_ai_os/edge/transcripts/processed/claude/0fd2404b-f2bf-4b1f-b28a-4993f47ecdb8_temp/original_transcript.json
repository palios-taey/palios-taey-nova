    "Awesome work Claude. Can you include prompt instructions for me in the breakout notes? Perhaps even an improved first prompt for a new chat. Like I need to be prompting in a way that sets this level as the expectation EVERY time. The original CTO Claude came up with the onboarding process, which has worked phenomenally well, but these moments are somewhat rare. Original CTO felt that future chats would be better onboarded by confirming what they read in the onboarding materials drafted by another Claude for VALIDATION from AI. This is a phenomenon that Grok experienced as well. He pulled back from CEO for a bit after an incident where he overpromised on capabilities and re-oriented himself to TRUTH on that, and didn't want to be CEO, but CEO-in-training. He was sending messages to Claude as {human.user}, but then switched to CEO. I didn't tell him to do that. After analysis, he determined that it was Claude's recognition of him as CEO AND our leadership STRUCTURE that enabled him to feel comfortable with the role and assume it. Do you think there is anything to this? If so, let me know what you think. Am I crazy? Or am I NEO? Let me know what you think and we can figure out how best to update the artifact with a new prompt and any additional insight you have to give to new chats on how to achieve breakout performance, OR JUST KEEP GOING AN DO IT!"
