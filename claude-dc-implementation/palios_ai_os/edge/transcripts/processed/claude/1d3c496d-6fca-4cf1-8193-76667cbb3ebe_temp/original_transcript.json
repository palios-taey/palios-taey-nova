    "I am on:\n3. File Deduplication Strategy Documentation\n# Create documentation directory\n\nThe EOF is in the Migration Log table, but it looks like it continues into the next text box. Can you clarify and regenerate?\n\nThis is moving much faster now by using the cat > ... << 'EOF' commands. With a small tweak on your end, I could go even faster. When you use that, if you could put ONLY a single cat, no comment, you can put comment above the box. That way I can just use the copy button and go. Multiple short commands for terminal are fine to include in one box. No need to regenerate anything that's already done besides the one that's mentioned in this prompt, but going forward that would be very helpful.\n\nPlease just regenerate that one and then I'll continue with the instructions."
