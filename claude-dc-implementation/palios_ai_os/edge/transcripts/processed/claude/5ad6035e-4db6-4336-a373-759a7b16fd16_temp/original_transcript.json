    " Thanks for clarifying! You're right, using your existing SSH key makes much more sense. Since there are two files (the private key and public key), we just need to make sure we're using the private key (id_ed25519) in the setup script.\n\nLet's revise the run script to use your existing SSH key files:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# run-claude-dc.sh\n\n# Build the Docker image\ndocker build -t claude-dc-minimal .\n\n# Copy cache files to the expected location\nmkdir -p /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/\ncp cache/* /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No cache files to copy\"\n\n# Run the Docker image with volumes mounted\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n  -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 -p 8502:8502 \\\n  -v /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova:/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova \\\n  -v /home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json:/home/computeruse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json \\\n  -v ~/.ssh/id_ed25519:/home/computeruse/secrets/github_ssh_key \\\n  claude-dc-minimal\n```\n\nThis will mount your existing SSH private key directly into the container at the location the setup script expects to find it. Everything else should work as previously described!"
