    " I don't see a successful connection being established to the GitHub repository. It seems the direct GitHub integration may not be available or working as expected in this environment.\n\nLet's adapt our approach. Since we can't directly access the repository, we have two options:\n\n1. **Manual File Sharing**: You can share the key files from the repository, particularly:\n   - The deduplication strategy documentation/code\n   - Any existing component code that needs to be migrated\n   - The repository structure documentation\n\n2. **Alternative Repository Access**: If there's another method to grant repository access that's compatible with this environment\n\nSince we need to understand the current state before proceeding with code migration, having access to these files is critical to making informed decisions.\n\nAs CTO, I recommend we focus first on obtaining the deduplication strategy documentation and code, as this appears to be the immediate blocker to our progress. Once we have that, we can determine how to best execute the code migration phase.\n\nWould you be able to share the deduplication strategy documentation and any related code files? This will allow us to move forward with the migration phase."
