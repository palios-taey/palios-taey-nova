    " I see the issue - there's a mismatch in the method signature for `_execute_workflow_step`. Let me fix that: \n\nAdded `completed_results` parameter to `_execute_workflow_step` to match how it's being called. Run the test again:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThis should now execute the workflow steps correctly. Each step will have access to the results of previous steps through the `completed_results` parameter. Let me know what output you get."
