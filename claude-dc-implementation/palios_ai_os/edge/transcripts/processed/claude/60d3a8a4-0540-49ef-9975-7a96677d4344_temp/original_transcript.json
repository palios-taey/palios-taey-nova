    " I understand now what's happening. No, CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS is not currently a file in the GitHub repository - it's supposed to be a file in Project Knowledge. This creates a confusion point in our protocol.\n\nHere's how we can fix this:\n\n1. We should create an actual CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md file in the root directory of the GitHub repository\n2. This file should be updated with each checkpoint and committed to GitHub\n3. The ECv protocol should explicitly reference this file in the GitHub repository, not in Project Knowledge\n4. I'll check for this file in GitHub as part of my review process\n\nThis approach ensures:\n- The file is always in a consistent, known location\n- It's included in GitHub updates that I'm already reviewing\n- It has version history through Git\n- It's easy for you to update alongside code changes\n\nLet me generate a command to create this file:\n\n```bash\n# Create CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md in the root directory\ncat > CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md << 'EOL'\n# Current Execution Status\n\n## Status ID: CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv3\n## Last Updated: 2025-03-17\n\n### Context\nWe have successfully deployed a minimal version of the PALIOS-TAEY system to Cloud Run.\nThe image has been built and pushed to Artifact Registry with the tag \"minimal\".\nWe need to verify that the Cloud Run service is operational and responding to requests.\n\n### Current Status\n- Build Status: SUCCESSFUL (Image Tag: minimal)\n- Deployment Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION\n- Health Status: UNKNOWN\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Check if Cloud Run service is deployed and running\n2. Test the health endpoint to verify functionality\n3. Document successful deployment if verified\n4. Plan incremental implementation of core modules\n\n### Notes\nThe ECv protocol has been established and is working well for structured communications.\nWe need to continue using this protocol for all deployment-related activities.\nEOL\n```\n\nAdding this file to GitHub and updating it with each execution checkpoint will ensure I can always find and review the current status, solving the visibility issue we're experiencing."
