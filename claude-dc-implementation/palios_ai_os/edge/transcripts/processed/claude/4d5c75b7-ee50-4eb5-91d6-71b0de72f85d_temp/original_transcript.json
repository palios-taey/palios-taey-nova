    "* **We formulate a concise list of targeted questions for Claude.** Based on our initial code review of `circuit_breakers_impl.js`, the key questions we need to ask Claude are:\n   * `parseWindow()` function: \"Where is the `parseWindow()` function defined? Is it in `circuit_breakers_impl.js` or another file? Could you provide the code for `parseWindow()`?\"\n   * `notifyCircuitOpen(reason)` and `pauseSystem()` functions: \"Where are the `notifyCircuitOpen(reason)` and `pauseSystem()` functions defined? Could you provide the code for these functions and briefly explain what actions they perform when the circuit breaker opens?\"\n   * `HALF_OPEN` state logic: \"The code mentions `HALF_OPEN` state in a comment, but we don't see explicit logic for it. Is the `HALF_OPEN` state and the circuit closing logic implemented elsewhere? If so, where, and could you briefly describe how it works? If not, is `HALF_OPEN` state intentionally not implemented in this version?\"\n   * `metrics` input to `checkMetrics()`: \"In the `checkMetrics(metrics)` function, what is the expected structure and content of the `metrics` input object? What are the keys it should contain (e.g., 'systemLoad', 'errorRate', etc.) and what type of values are expected for each key?\"\n   * **Overall Context/Usage:** \"Could you briefly describe how the `SystemCircuitBreaker` class is intended to be used within the PALIOS-TAEY system? Which components are responsible for monitoring metrics and calling `checkMetrics()`? What is the intended overall behavior when a circuit breaker trips?\"\n*"
