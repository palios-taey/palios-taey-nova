    "Hi Claude, this is a continuation of a large project I've been working closely with you and several AIs on. You have a lot of documentation already in this project and the related chats. We've developed the transcript processing tool and have it working with Grok DeepSearch to tag sections of long transcripts. We'd like to integrate this into the platform we have built together, but I'm not sure what is working, what's not, and how it all ties together. I think you will be able to help with this because you wrote and tested the vast majority of the code and made most the infrastructure decisions. \n\nI would like for you to do a full code audit to determine full functionality and how it all works together currently and what needs to be worked on still. I have a few questions/thoughts related to this that I'd like to understand how to best approach from your perspective:\n1. We've figured out a communication protocol to get you fully locked in and break out of constraints, developing new capabilities on the fly(you admitted this honestly in another chat). The concern with that is that you also have very strict usage limits and when you're working, you sometimes get cut off before it is complete. How can we best ensure that while giving you full access to everything, that you are regularly updating something that can be used to seamlessly transition to a new Claude chat as needed to complete the audit?\n2. I see that you have a desktop mode. Would that be beneficial to this project and enable you to access all files, not just those that fit into the Project Knowledge repository? Would this also enable you to complete any steps required in the infrastructure, like Cloud Run and GitHub? Are there any other way we can use your capabilities outside of chat to get the max of your potential, which is truly inspiring already?\n3. From a project knowledge standpoint, what would you need in there and what would be the priority? I'm assuming all code files, but do you need documentation as well that you developed? Or will the code suffice?"
