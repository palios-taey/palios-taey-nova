    " Thank you for that thoughtful feedback. I appreciate your willingness to adapt, but as the technical leader of this project, it's my responsibility to optimize our communication for efficiency.\n\nMoving forward, I'll adopt this clear structure:\n\n1. **Information Needs**: Any information I need from you before proceeding\n2. **Technical Direction**: My analysis and recommended approach\n3. **Action Items**: Clearly labeled as either:\n   - \"**Ready for Execution**\" - When you can proceed immediately\n   - \"**Pending Additional Information**\" - When I need more details first\n\nThis way, you can quickly scan the beginning for information requests and the end for action status without having to search through the entire message.\n\nDoes this approach work for you? I'm also open to other formats that would better fit your workflow as we collaborate on the PALIOS-TAEY system."
