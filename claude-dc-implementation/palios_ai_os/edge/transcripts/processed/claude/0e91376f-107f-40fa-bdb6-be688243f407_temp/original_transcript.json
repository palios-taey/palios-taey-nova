    "Ok, he's successfully loaded the cache. We need to learn from this. My repository is palios-taey/palios-taey-nova. I've updated Project knowledge with the webhook-integration-instructions and a file for build instructions without the credentials at the bottom. It appears that some repository instructions are off in these. I would like him to use the repository that we're already using and just add a folder to it. I have done this, and this is the path in his directory structure: /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/\n\nWhen he saves files here, what will the webhook do? We need to update these instructions and the build instructions. Based on what we experienced with him trying to process transcripts on his own, we need to update the build instructions as well. Let's have him focus on the 2 things we need most, which is something to process the full transcripts on my machine using EVE/MCP, get them into GCS structured properly in new supporting Firebase collections (skeleton there now) and build a dashboard that we can utilize to review the Charter and history. Once we have this up, we can use this to review that and then allow him to continue to build the rest of what is needed for this phase, the demo and everything. What do you think? This is just me thinking out loud, so not looking for agreement, just a plan so that we can get him to save his stuff in the right place so it can stay in sync and we can avoid him having to look at transcripts."
