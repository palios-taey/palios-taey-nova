    " # PALIOS-TAEY Deployment Implementation\n\nAfter reviewing the code in GitHub, I'll now implement a streamlined deployment process for the PALIOS-TAEY system.\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\nThe `src/main.py` file is a comprehensive Flask application that integrates all core components. I'll create a deployment script that builds from the root directory and deploys to Cloud Run, ensuring all necessary permissions and configurations are in place.\n\n## Deployment Script\n\nLet's create a deployment script that handles the entire process: \n\n## Dockerfile Updates\n\nLet's also ensure the Dockerfile is properly configured for our deployment: \n\n## Updated Requirements File\n\nLet's ensure all dependencies are correctly specified: \n\n## Service Account Setup\n\nWe need to ensure the service account has the necessary permissions: \n\n\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nTo deploy the PALIOS-TAEY system to GCP, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make the deployment script executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x deploy.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Run the deployment script:\n   ```bash\n   ./deploy.sh\n   ```\n\nThe script will:\n1. Configure the GCP project\n2. Enable required APIs\n3. Build and push the Docker image\n4. Create and configure a Firestore database if needed\n5. Deploy the application to Cloud Run\n6. Set up a service account with necessary permissions\n7. Display the deployed service URL\n\n## Post-Deployment Verification\n\nAfter deployment, verify the system is working properly by:\n\n1. Checking the `/health` endpoint\n2. Testing basic memory operations\n3. Verifying model routing functionality\n4. Testing transcript processing\n\nIf you encounter any issues, the logs can be viewed using:\n```bash\ngcloud logging read \"resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=palios-taey\" --limit=50\n```\n\nThis deployment approach leverages the strengths of the existing locally-tested codebase while ensuring proper configuration for GCP. Let me know when you're ready to execute this plan."
