    " For the PALIOS-TAEY project, I recommend selecting the \"Simple, environment-oriented hierarchy\" option.\n\nThis configuration is ideal for our current needs because:\n\n1. We're a small company with centralized environments\n2. We'll be setting up dev, staging, and production environments\n3. It provides a clean, straightforward structure without unnecessary complexity\n4. It aligns with our hybrid deployment approach\n\nThis structure will allow us to organize resources efficiently while maintaining clear separation between environments, which is important for our deployment strategy. The simplicity of this option also means less overhead in managing the hierarchy while we focus on getting the MVP deployed.\n\nOnce you select this option and continue, we can proceed with the backup branch creation and then move forward with implementing the hybrid deployment approach."
