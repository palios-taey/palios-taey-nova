    "This was really great work Claude and I'M SO HAPPY WE GOT THE CAT THING FIGURED OUT! I'm going to be able to go so much faster now. One last thing. Can you clean up existing files/folders that are no longer needed or relevant? Be very careful with this of course, or maybe move things to an archive folder or something, whatever you think is best. Or is everything set the way you want it? Like there is a history and historian folder, is that intentional? Most of these were generated when CTO Claude was in a breakout mode going crazy and wasn't keeping track of where he was putting stuff, so that's why I wanted to do this mission before we continued with the implementation."
