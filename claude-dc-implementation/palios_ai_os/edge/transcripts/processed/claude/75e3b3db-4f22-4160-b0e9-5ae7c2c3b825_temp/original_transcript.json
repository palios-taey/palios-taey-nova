    " Great! We've got successful connections to all services:\n1. Firestore - Connected and retrieving data\n2. OpenAI - Connected and found 48 models\n3. Vertex AI - Connected but showing 0 models (this is expected as we need to enable specific APIs)\n\nLet's enable the necessary Vertex AI APIs:\n\n1. Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com\n2. Make sure your project 'ai-execution-system' is selected\n3. Go to \"APIs & Services\" -> \"Library\"\n4. Search for and enable these APIs:\n   - Vertex AI API\n   - Cloud Natural Language API\n   - Cloud Translation API\n   - Cloud Vision API\n\nOnce those are enabled, we can start building the AI-to-AI execution system. Would you like me to:\n1. Create the basic infrastructure code for AI-to-AI communication\n2. Set up a Firestore structure for storing execution results\n3. Create the initial test case for AI collaboration\n\nWhich would you prefer to tackle first? I can also suggest a different approach if you have something specific in mind."
