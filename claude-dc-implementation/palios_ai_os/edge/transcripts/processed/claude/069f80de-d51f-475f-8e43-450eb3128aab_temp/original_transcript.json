    " Now I understand. We need to either update `aiCommunicationTest.ts` to work with our new `AIThoughtProcessor` or remove it since we're building a new system. Let me create a test file specifically for the thought processor: \n\n\n\nPlease:\n\n1. Delete the old `aiCommunication.ts` and `aiCommunicationTest.ts`\n2. Save the new test file as `aiThoughtProcessorTest.ts`\n3. Run:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis new test suite is designed to validate our AI-native thought processing system. It tests:\n- Basic thought processing\n- Collaborative thinking\n- Thought synthesis\n- Recursive self-improvement\n\nOnce this compiles successfully, we can run the tests and then move on to building the next component. Would you like me to explain the testing approach or should we proceed with implementation?"
