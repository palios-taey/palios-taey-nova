    " I want to clarify something - when you ask for the \"full text\" of the summaries, are you referring to:\n\n1. The concise bullet-point summaries I just provided in my previous message, or\n2. The complete content of the added/updated sections from both deliverables?\n\nI want to ensure I provide exactly what you need to facilitate your review. I can provide either:\n- Just the summaries from my previous message (copied exactly as written)\n- The full content of all added sections for both deliverables\n- Or both, if that would be most helpful\n\nPlease let me know which would be most useful for your review, and I'll provide it immediately."
