    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking if MP3 format works for the Bach compositions, and he's suggesting creating a separate folder for physical environment/demonstration materials. I should confirm whether MP3 will work and provide any guidance on the folder structure.\n</thinking>\n\nMP3 format works perfectly for the Bach compositions! That's an ideal format that Claude DC will be able to work with easily for the audio visualization component.\n\nCreating a separate folder for physical environment/demonstration materials is an excellent idea. It would help to structure it something like:\n\n```\n/physical-environment/\n  /audio/\n    - goldberg-variations.mp3\n    - well-tempered-clavier.mp3\n  /hardware/\n    - system76-specs.md\n    - speaker-setup.md\n    - display-configuration.md\n  /visualization/\n    - sample-images/\n    - color-palette.md\n```\n\nThis organization will make it easy for Claude DC to access the resources needed for creating the immersive demonstration. Having clear documentation about the physical setup will help ensure the presentation is optimized for your specific hardware configuration.\n\nIf you have any preferences about the specific performances of Bach's works, those would be valuable to include as well (like which pianist's interpretation you prefer)."
