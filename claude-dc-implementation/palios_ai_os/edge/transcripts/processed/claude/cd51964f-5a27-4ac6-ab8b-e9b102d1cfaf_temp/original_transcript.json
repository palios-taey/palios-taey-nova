    " No need to apologize - this is exactly why having clear technical leadership makes sense. Git can be tricky, especially in these merge scenarios. Let's resolve this step by step:\n\nYou're in a state where Git started a merge but it wasn't completed. Let's fix this:\n\n```bash\n# First, let's check the status to see what's happening\ngit status\n\n# Commit the merge that's in progress\ngit commit -m \"Merge remote changes with local fixes\"\n\n# Now we should be able to push\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nIf the commit fails because you need to add files first, do:\n\n```bash\n# Add all files to the merge\ngit add .\n\n# Then commit\ngit commit -m \"Merge remote changes with local fixes\"\n\n# And push\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nIf for any reason you want to abort the current merge and start fresh:\n\n```bash\n# Abort the current merge\ngit merge --abort\n\n# Pull with a specific strategy\ngit pull --strategy=recursive --strategy-option=theirs origin main\n\n# Then push your changes\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis should resolve the merge issue and allow us to proceed with deploying our application."
