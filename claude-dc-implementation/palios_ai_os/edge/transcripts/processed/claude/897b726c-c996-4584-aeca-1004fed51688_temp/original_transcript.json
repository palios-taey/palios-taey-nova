    " Thank you! I'm happy to guide you on making the specific changes needed to fix the unavailable components. Since we want to avoid full regeneration, here are the precise changes required:\n\n### 1. Fix for memory_service.py\n\nAdd the `create_memory_system` function at the end of the file, just before any `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block:\n\n```python\ndef create_memory_system(\n    project_id=None, \n    collection_prefix=\"\", \n    use_emulator=False, \n    use_mock=False,\n    cache_size=1000\n) -> UnifiedMemorySystem:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a unified memory system instance with robust error handling\n    \n    Args:\n        project_id: Google Cloud project ID\n        collection_prefix: Collection prefix\n        use_emulator: Whether to use the Firestore emulator\n        use_mock: Whether to use mock mode\n        cache_size: Memory cache size\n        \n    Returns:\n        UnifiedMemorySystem instance\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        memory_system = UnifiedMemorySystem(\n            project_id=project_id,\n            collection_prefix=collection_prefix,\n            use_emulator=use_emulator,\n            use_mock=use_mock,\n            cache_size=cache_size\n        )\n        return memory_system\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error creating memory system: {str(e)}\")\n        # Create with mock mode as fallback\n        return UnifiedMemorySystem(\n            project_id=None,\n            collection_prefix=\"\",\n            use_mock=True,\n            cache_size=cache_size\n        )\n```\n\n### 2. Fix for transcript_processor.py\n\nYou'll need to find line 418 (or around that line) where there's an indentation error. Based on the error message, there's an unexpected indent in this file. Look for lines where the indentation doesn't match the surrounding code. Typically, this occurs when a line has extra spaces at the beginning compared to other lines at the same code level.\n\nWithout seeing the exact line, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Open transcript_processor.py\n2. Go to line 418 (or around that area)\n3. Look for any line that has inconsistent indentation\n4. Fix the indentation to match the surrounding code level\n\nIf you can share the snippet around line 418, I can provide more specific guidance for the fix.\n\nOnce these changes are made, restart the server and run the tests again. All components should initialize properly, and all tests should pass."
