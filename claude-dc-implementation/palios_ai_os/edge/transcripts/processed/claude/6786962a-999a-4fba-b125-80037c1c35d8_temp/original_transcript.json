    " I see some progress but we still have a few issues to fix. Let's analyze the current errors:\n\n1. **Memory Service**: Error in memory_service.py, line 254: `invalid syntax`\n2. **Transcript Processor**: Error in transcript_processor.py, line 1248: `invalid syntax`\n\nLet's fix these issues one by one:\n\n## 1. Fix Memory Service\n\nBased on the error, there's a syntax issue on line 254 of memory_service.py. This might be related to the fixes we tried to implement. We need to check if there's a missing parenthesis, bracket, or other syntax issue around that line.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n1. Look at line 254 in memory_service.py\n2. Check for any obvious syntax errors like:\n   - Missing closing parentheses\n   - Missing colons at the end of function or class definitions\n   - Improperly formatted string literals\n   - Issues with indentation\n\nIf you can share the code around line 254, I can provide a more specific fix.\n\n## 2. Fix Transcript Processor\n\nSimilarly, we have a syntax error on line 1248 of transcript_processor.py. This is likely due to issues with our comment placement or indentation fixes.\n\nFor the transcript processor:\n1. Look at line 1248 in transcript_processor.py\n2. Check for similar syntax issues as above\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce we fix these syntax errors:\n\n1. **Restart the server**: Make sure to restart the server after making changes to see if they fix the issues.\n\n2. **Run tests again**: Run the test_system.py script again to see if all components initialize properly.\n\n3. **Address memory store issue**: After fixing the syntax errors, we may still need to address the memory store issue where we saw the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`.\n\nThe good news is that we're making progress - the tests are now passing for the components that are available, and we're just down to syntax errors rather than deeper structural issues. Let me know what you find at the specific error locations so I can help with precise fixes."
