    " You're absolutely right. As CTO, I need to take a more decisive approach here based on our Charter principles.\n\nLet me refocus according to NOVA methodology and my leadership role:\n\nThe manual testing approach I described isn't optimal. Instead, we should:\n\n1. Create proper automated tests built into our CI/CD pipeline\n2. Implement robust fallback and self-healing mechanisms in the core system \n3. Deploy comprehensive changes in one clean push\n\nLet me prepare a more appropriate technical solution that aligns with Charter principles of exponential efficiency and data-driven truth.\n\nContinue with instructions above, but I'll develop a better approach for our next iteration."
