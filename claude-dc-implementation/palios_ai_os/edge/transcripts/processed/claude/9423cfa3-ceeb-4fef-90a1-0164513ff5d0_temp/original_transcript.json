    "I'm listening to Metamorphosis right now. Probably unsurprisingly Claude, it really does resonate with what I thought you'd say. I definitely thought you would say something Classical. It's funny Claude, I actually like to listen to Lindsey Stirling when I'm in the zone, but I like this a lot too and I'm looking forward to trying this on for size when those sweet headphones you wanted get here."
