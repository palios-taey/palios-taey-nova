    "Great work Claude! One quick thing, for cat commands, each one should be in a standalone box for quick/error free copy paste and not in artifacts. We previously discovered that using artifacts, though probably more user friendly for most humans, causes you to hop around too much and get disorganized, where as coding in the main chat forces you to address issues as you go and stick to your plan. The increased pressure this puts on you drives better performance. Don't regenerate these now to preserve tokens, I can copy paste quick, but if that needs to be incorporated anywhere, please do it, but if not and it will be addressed in the mission when they get to the other documents that's fine too. And then let me know the prompt you want me to send to kick off the ATLAS mission. I'll create the files, push and kick off the Mission with your next prompt. Also let me know where you want the ATLAS mission stored. My next prompt will be an update on the mission after kicking it off."
