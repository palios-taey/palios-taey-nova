    " I'd like to examine the updated GitHub repository to provide meaningful feedback. However, I don't currently have the ability to directly access or browse GitHub repositories unless you share specific content with me.\n\nTo help me understand what you've added to GitHub, could you please:\n\n1. Share the repository URL or name\n2. Provide sample code or structure from key files you've added\n3. Describe the main components you've implemented\n4. Share any README content that explains the organization\n\nOnce you share these details, I can provide specific feedback on the implementation and how it aligns with our discussions about transcript processing, unified memory, and the multi-AI collaboration structure.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm particularly interested in understanding how you've structured the transcript processing system and how the different AI components (Claude DC, Grok, and myself) will interact within this framework."
