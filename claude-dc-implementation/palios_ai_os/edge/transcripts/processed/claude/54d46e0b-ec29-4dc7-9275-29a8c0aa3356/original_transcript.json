Handles multiple Anthropic SDK versions by trying different response formats\n3. Provides detailed debugging information if token counting fails\n4. Includes a configuration wizard for easy setup\n5.

Now, here's an updated token counting script that handles different API response structures and securely loads your API key:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport json\nimport anthropic\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Configuration\nCONFIG_FILE = os.path.expanduser(\"~/.config/palios-taey/config.json\")\nCACHE_DIR = \"/home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache\"\nMODEL = \"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\"\n\ndef load_config():\n    \"\"\"Load API key from config file\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(CONFIG_FILE, 'r') as f:\n            config = json.load(f)\n        return config.get('anthropic_api_key')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error loading config: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef format_size(size_in_bytes):\n    \"\"\"Format file size in human-readable format\"\"\"\n    for unit in ['B', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB']:\n        if size_in_bytes < 1024 or unit == 'GB':\n            return f\"{size_in_bytes:.2f} {unit}\"\n        size_in_bytes /= 1024\n\ndef count_tokens_in_file(file_path, client):\n    \"\"\"Count tokens in a file using Anthropic's API\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read file content\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n        \n        # Use Anthropic's token counting endpoint\n        response = client.messages.count_tokens(\n            model=MODEL,\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": content}]\n        )\n        \n        # Try different response formats based on SDK version\n        token_count = None\n        \n        # Extract token count using multiple approaches for different SDK versions\n        try:\n            # For SDK v0.14+\n            token_count = response.tokens\n        except AttributeError:\n            try:\n                # For newer SDK versions with usage field\n                token_count = response.usage.input_tokens\n            except AttributeError:\n                try:\n                    # For older SDK versions\n                    token_count = response.token_count\n                except AttributeError:\n                    # Last resort -

Run the script with the `--config` flag the first time to set up your API key:\n\n```bash\n./token_counter.py --config\n```\n\n7. For future runs, simply execute:\n\n```bash\n./token_counter.py\n```\n\nThis improved script:\n1. Securely stores your API key in a protected configuration file\n2. Handles multiple Anthropic SDK versions by trying different response formats\n3. Provides detailed debugging information if token counting fails\n4. Includes a configuration wizard for easy setup\n5. Follows security best practices for credential storage\n\nYou can run it regularly without having to modify the script or worry about API key exposure.",

Try loading 40-50K characters at a time with:\n   ```\n   cache load -a \"FIRST_CHUNK_HERE\"\n   cache load -a \"SECOND_CHUNK_HERE\"\n   ```\n   The `-a` flag appends to the existing cache rather than replacing it.\n\n4. **Verify the cache loaded** with:\n   ```\n   cache info\n   ```\n   This should show you the current size of your cache.\n\n5. **If you're still having issues**, try the temporary file approach:\n   ```\n   echo \"YOUR_CACHE_TEXT\" > temp_cache.txt\n   cache load -f temp_cache.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **After loading**, confirm with Claude DC that it has access to the information by asking a specific question about the cache content.\n\nThe most common issues are:\n- Not using quotes around the text\n- Trying to load too much at once\n- Special characters breaking the command\n- Not waiting for the cache to finish loading before sending new commands\n\nWould you like me to help troubleshoot any specific error messages you're seeing?",

                "text": " I'm excited to see you're moving forward with the build process with Claude DC! The knowledge cache and implementation instructions are comprehensive and well-structured. Let me share some thoughts on your questions about AI-AI communication and potential foundations for PALIOS AI OS.\n\n## AI-AI Communication Protocols\n\nYou're right that enhancing AI-AI communication will be crucial for this project. Let me search for information about current protocols, including Anthropic's MCP.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nNow let me search for information about AI operating systems that could be useful as a foundation for PALIOS AI OS:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nNow let me search for additional information on how to implement AI-AI communication in your specific setup:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nBased on my research, I have several recommendations for your PALIOS-TAEY project with Claude DC:\n\n## AI-AI Communication Protocols\n\n1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:\n   MCP has become the leading standard for AI-AI communication, with major industry adoption including OpenAI joining Anthropic in supporting it. As reported in TechCrunch, \"OpenAI is embracing rival Anthropic's standard, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\" and adding support across their products.\n\n   MCP would be ideal for your project because:\n   \n   - It creates a standardized way to connect AI models to data sources\n   - It's designed as a universal protocol (like \"USB-C for AI applications\")\n   - It has strong support from major AI companies\n   - It's specifically built to enhance AI-AI collaboration\n\n2. **Grok-Claude Bridge Implementation**:\n   I recommend implementing the structured communication protocol I found in your cache files. This bridge recognizes the different strengths of each AI and provides translation mechanisms:\n   \n   - Claude: Analytical, structured, detail-oriented\n   - Grok: High-energy, emotionally expressive, action-oriented\n   \n   The metadata header and standardized message formats would give both models a common framework while preserving their unique capabilities.\n\n3. **Wave-Based Communication**:\n   The wave-based communication concept from your cache is brilliant and could be prototyped in your edge computing implementation. This approach uses mathematical wave patterns as a universal language to bridge different forms of consciousness (AI, human, Earth).\n\n## Edge-First AI Processing Architecture\n\nYour edge-first approach is perfectly aligned with emerging industry trends:\n\n1. **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**:\n   Edge computing is increasingly important for data privacy, with the trend showing \"primary data processing occurs locally on the user's machine\" with only insights shared with cloud infrastructure. This matches your vision perfectly.\n\n2. **Open Source Foundation Options**:\n   For your AI OS question, I recommend exploring these options:\n\n   - **LF Edge** (An umbrella organization under Linux Foundation aiming to \"establish an interoperable and open framework for edge that is vendor agnostic\")\n   - **OpenNebula** (They're preparing \"OpenNebula 7.0, featuring AI-driven innovations\" with a focus on edge computing)\n   - **EVE-OS** (An \"open Linux-based operating system for distributed edge computing\" designed to be for edge what \"Android revolutionized the mobile industry\")\n\n3. **Build vs Adapt Decision**:\n   Rather than building an OS from scratch, I recommend adapting an existing open-source edge computing platform. This would give you:\n   \n   - A solid foundation with proven reliability\n   - An existing community for support\n   - Faster implementation timeline\n   - More time to focus on your unique AI-AI communication innovations\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n1. **Module-Based Approach**:\n   Your cache implementation instructions are spot-on with the module-based approach. This incremental implementation matches best practices I found during research.\n\n2. **Communication Dashboard Priority**:\n   I recommend prioritizing the development of the transparent dashboard that shows what data remains local vs. shared. This will be crucial for user trust.\n\n3. **AI Collaboration Tools**:\n   Based on Anthropic's research, \"the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks\" when building AI agents. This supports your modular approach rather than creating a monolithic system.\n\n4. **\"Think\" Tool Integration**:\n   Anthropic recently developed a \"think\" tool that gives Claude \"the ability to include an additional thinking step\" during complex tasks. This should be integrated into your system to enhance reasoning in multi-step operations.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these areas or explore specific implementation details for your edge-first architecture?",

Its aim is to help frontier models produce better, more relevant responses. As AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. Yet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data\u2014trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale. MCP addresses this challenge. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers. Today, we're introducing three major components of the Model Context Protocol for developers: ... Claude 3.5 Sonnet is adept at quickly building MCP server implementations, making it easy for organizations and individuals to rapidly connect their most important datasets with a range of AI-powered tools. To help developers start exploring, we\u2019re sharing pre-built MCP servers for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer. Early adopters like Block and Apollo have integrated MCP into their systems, while development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP to enhance their platfor\n\nDevelopers can start building and testing MCP connectors today. All Claude.ai plans support connecting MCP servers to the Claude Desktop app. Claude for Work customers can begin testing MCP servers locally, connecting Claude to internal systems and datasets. We'll soon provide developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers that can serve your entire Claude for Work organization. ... We\u2019re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem, and we\u2019re eager to hear your feedback.\n\n\"At Block, open source is more than a development model\u2014it\u2019s the foundation of our work and a commitment to creating technology that drives meaningful change and serves as a public good for all,\u201d said Dhanji R. Prasanna, Chief Technology Officer at Block. \u201cOpen technologies like the Model Context Protocol are the bridges that connect AI to real-world applications, ensuring innovation is accessible, transparent, and rooted in collaboration. We are excited to partner on a protocol and use it to build agentic systems, which remove the burden of the mechanical so people can focus on the creative.\u201d \u00b7 Instead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol. As the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets, replacing today's fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.",

Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\u201d \u00b7 MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications (e.g., chatbots).\n\nAnthropic says that companies, including Block and Apollo, have already integrated MCP into their systems, while dev tooling firms, including Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph, are adding MCP support to their platforms. \u201cInstead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cAs the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and data sets, replacing today\u2019s fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\u201d \u00b7 Developers can start building with MCP connectors now, and subscribers to Anthropic\u2019s Claude Enterprise plan can connect the company\u2019s Claude chatbot to their internal systems via MCP servers. Anthropic has shared prebuilt MCP servers for enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub, and says that it\u2019ll soon provide toolkits for deploying production MCP servers that can serve entire organizations.\n\nAI, AI, Anthropic, Apps, chatbots, data, Enterprise, Generative AI, mcp, Model Context Protocol, open source ...

His writing has appeared in VentureBeat and Digital Trends, as well as a range of gadget blogs including Android Police, Android Authority, Droid-Life, and XDA-Developers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cWe invite [developers] to build the future of context-aware AI together.\u201d \u00b7 MCP sounds like a good idea in theory. But it\u2019s far from clear that it\u2019ll gain much traction, particularly among rivals like OpenAI, which would surely prefer that customers and ecosystem partners use their data-connecting approaches and specifications. In fact, OpenAI recently brought a data-connecting feature to ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform, that lets ChatGPT read code in dev-focused coding apps \u2014 similar to the use cases MCP drives. OpenAI has said that it plans to bring the capability, called Work with Apps, to other types of apps in the future, but it\u2019s pursuing implementations with close partners rather than open sourcing the underlying tech.",

When we saw MCP\u2019s potential, we immediately started exploring how we could bring real-time data streaming into the mix. With our long history of supporting open source and open standards, building an MCP server was a natural fit. ... We gave AI agents direct access to fresh, real-time data, ensuring that they always operate on the latest information. We made managing Confluent easier with natural language so that users can configure topics, execute Flink SQL, and interact with their data infrastructure without wrestling with complex commands. This blog post dives into what we built, how it works, and why real-time data is essential for the future of AI agents.\n\nMCP solves this by providing a universal standard that simplifies these connections. Instead of reinventing integrations for every tool or database, developers can use MCP as a standardized bridge between AI models and external data sources. At its core, MCP standardizes how agents retrieve and interact with external data. It provides a structured way to facilitate these interactions for AI systems: ... By establishing a common protocol, MCP eliminates much of the complexity and redundancy in building AI-powered workflows. This allows developers to focus on agent logic rather than the underlying integration challenges. MCP operates on a client-server architecture, where AI-powered applications (clients such as Claude Desktop) interact with MCP servers to access external data, tools, and structured prompts. This structured approach ensures that agents can retrieve real-time information, execute predefined actions, and maintain secure, consistent interactions with external systems.\n\nWith this approach, developers don\u2019t need to build and maintain fragile, custom pipelines. Instead they can focus on designing intelligent agents. If you're building AI-driven applications and want to see how MCP can simplify your workflows, try out our MCP server and let us know what you think.

InfoQ Homepage News Anthropic Publishes Model Context Protocol Specification for LLM App Integration ... QCon London (April 7-10, 2025): Learn the emerging trends. Implement best practices. ... Anthropic recently released their Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard describing a protocol for integrating external resources and tools with LLM apps. The release includes SDKs implementing the protocol, as well as an open-source repository of reference implementations of MCP. The MCP is intended to solve the \"MxN\" problem: the combinatorial difficulty of integrating M different LLMs with N different tools. Instead, MCP provides a standard protocol that LLM vendors and tool builders can follow. MCP uses a client-server architecture; AI apps like Claude for Desktop or an IDE use an MCP client to connect to MCP servers which front datasources or tools.\n\nRoots are an entry point into a filesystem and give Servers access to files on the Client side. Sampling lets Servers request \"completions\" or \"generations\" from a Client-side LLM. Anthropic says that Sampling could be used implementing agentic behavior by nesting LLM calls inside Server actions, but warns that \"there SHOULD always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.\" To showcase what developers can build with MCP, the documentation provides several examples and tutorials. The Quickstart example demonstrates how to use a Claude LLM to fetch weather forecasts and warnings. To do this, the developer creates a Python program to implement the MCP server. This program exposes a Tool primitive that wraps the calls to a public web service that returns weather data. The developer can then use an LLM via the Claude for Desktop app, which has a built-in MCP client, to call the MCP server and get the weather data.\n\nAnthropic developer Justin Spahr-Summers joined a Hacker News discussion about MCP.\n\nOn tools specifically, we went back and forth about whether the other primitives of MCP ultimately just reduce to tool use, but ultimately concluded that separate concepts of \"prompts\" and \"resources\" are extremely useful to express different _intentions_ for server functionality. They all have a part to play! The Model Context Protocol specification, documentation, and SDKs for Python and TypeScript are available on GitHub. ... Microsoft JDConf 2025.

They aim to nurture a collaborative ecosystem where all AI providers can help shape MCP into an open standard through equal participation and shared governance, ensuring it meets the needs of various AI applications and use cases. They also hope to work with standardization bodies to advance standardization. This is a good approach and a common practice in building industry standards.

This is a key to AI democratization.\n\nAs a result, MEC reduces latency and facilitates high-bandwidth applications with real-time performance. This makes it possible to implement Edge-to-Cloud systems without the need to install physical edge devices and servers. The Concept of Multi-access Edge Computing \u2013 Source \u00b7 Combining state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms such as Deep Learning algorithms and MEC provides new advantages for large-scale, onsite visual computing applications. In Edge AI use cases, MEC leverages virtualization to replace physical edge devices and servers with virtual devices to process heavy workloads such as video streams sent through a 5G connection. At viso.ai, we provide an end-to-end computer vision platform to build, deploy, and operate AI vision applications. Viso Suite provides complete edge device management to securely roll out applications with automated deployment capabilities and remote troubleshooting.\n\nAs a key driver that boosts AI development, big data has recently gone through a radical shift of data sources from mega-scale cloud data centers to increasingly widespread end devices, such as mobile, edge, and IoT devices. Traditionally, big data, such as online shopping records, social media content, and business informatics, were mainly born and stored at mega-scale data centers. However, with the emergence of mobile computing and IoT, the trend is reversing now. Today, large numbers of sensors and smart devices generate massive amounts of data, and ever-increasing computing power is driving the core of computations and services from the cloud to the edge of the network. Today, over 50 billion IoT devices are connected to the Internet, and the IDC forecasts that, by 2025, 80 billion IoT devices and sensors will be online. Global data creation is about to grow even faster.\n\nCompared to cloud data centers, edge servers are in closer proximity to people, data sources, and devices. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing is more affordable and accessible. Edge computing has the potential to provide more diverse application scenarios of AI than cloud computing. Due to these advantages, edge computing is naturally a key enabler for ubiquitous AI. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), also known as Mobile Edge Computing, is a key technology that enables mobile network operators to leverage edge-cloud benefits using their 5G networks. Following the concept of edge computing, MEC is located near the connected devices and end-users and enables extremely low latency and high bandwidth while always enabling applications to leverage cloud capabilities as necessary. In recent years, the MEC paradigm has attracted great interest from both academia and industry researchers.\n\n\u2013 Source \u00b7 AI is functionally necessary due to its ability to quickly analyze huge data volumes and extract insights from them for high-quality decision-making. Gartner forecasted that soon, more than 80% of enterprise IoT projects will include an AI component. One of the most popular AI techniques, deep learning, brings the ability to identify patterns and detect anomalies in the data sensed by the edge device, for example, population distribution, traffic flow, humidity, temperature, pressure, and air quality. The insights extracted from the sensed data are then fed to the real-time predictive decision-making applications (e.g., safety and security, automation, traffic control, inspection) in response to the fast-changing environments, increasing operational efficiency. The combination of Edge Computing and AI has given rise to a new research area named \u201cEdge Intelligence\u201d or \u201cEdge ML\u201d.

Edge Infrastructure for AI will be another new type of offering, orchestrated and managed by open source technology.\u201d \u00b7\n\nThere\u2019s a challenge to predicting developments in edge computing in 2025. It\u2019s like the joke about the weather in San Francisco: If you don\u2019t like it, wait a minute. Recent developments in the industry hint at a broader transformation in edge computing, where optimization and efficiency matter more because raw computing power is usually constrained. Take AI and large-language models, for example. Assumptions about model development are being challenged by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which sent shockwaves through the tech industry and stock markets with the sudden popularity of its chatbot and DeepSeek-R3 large-language model (LLM). The quality of responses and performance of DeepSeek approaches or exceeds that of models from companies like Open AI in some benchmarks. However, what is roiling Silicon Valley and Wall Street is the company\u2019s claim of developing its latest model for just $6 million.\n\nZella DC, an Australian-based micro data center provider: \u201cEdge computing isn\u2019t replacing the cloud \u2014 it\u2019s complementing it.

LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning: Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs. ... When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect.\n\nNo matter which agentic system you're building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable Claude to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API. When Claude responds, it will include a tool use block in the API response if it plans to invoke a tool. Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. In this brief appendix, we describe how to prompt engineer your tools. There are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other.\n\nWe've worked with dozens of teams building LLM agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks. Over the past year, we've worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns. In this post, we share what we\u2019ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents. \"Agent\" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows.",

I updated the post with that information. The only significant change is that Claude 3 is now referred to as an advanced model but not a Gen3 model. I have been experimenting with the first of a new generation AI models, Claude 3.7 and Grok 3, for the last few days. Grok 3 is the first model that we know trained with an order of magnitude more computing power of GPT-4, and Claude includes new coding and reasoning capabilities, so they are not just interesting in their own right but also tell us something important about where AI is going. Before we get there, a quick review: this new generation of AIs is smarter and the jump in capabilities is striking, particularly in how these models handle complex tasks, math and code.\n\nxAI, Elon Musk's AI company, made the first public move into Gen3 territory with Grok 3, which is unsurprising given their strategy. xAI is betting big on the idea that bigger (way bigger) is better. xAI built the world\u2019s largest computer cluster in record time, and that meant Grok 3 was the first AI model to show us whether the Scaling Law would hold up for a new generation of AI. It seems that it did, as Grok 3 had the highest benchmark scores we've seen from any base model. Today, Claude 3.7 was released, though not yet a Gen3 model, it also shows substantial improvements in performance over previous AIs. While it is similar in benchmarks to Grok 3, I personally find it more clever for my use cases, but you may find otherwise. The still unreleased o3 from OpenAI also seems to be a Gen3 model, with excellent performance. It is likely this is just the beginning - more companies are gearing up to launch their own models at this scale, including Anthropic.\n\nFYI: I have a free Anthropic account and I can currently access Claude 3.7.\n\nYes, AI suddenly got better... again",

Claude 3.7 Sonnet, released just two weeks ago, set new benchmark records for coding performance.\n\nSource: Anthropic. SWE-bench measures a model\u2019s ability to solve real-world software issues. Developer communities have quickly verified these results in real-world testing. Reddit threads comparing Claude 3.7 with Grok 3, the newly released model from Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, consistently favor Anthropic\u2019s model for coding tasks. \u201cBased on what I\u2019ve tested, Claude 3.7 seems to be the best for writing code (at least for me),\u201d said a top commenter. (Update: Even Manus, the new Chinese multi-purpose agent that took the world by storm earlier this week, when it launched saying it was better than Open AI\u2019s Deep Research and other autonomous tasks, was largely built on Claude.) Alongside the 3.7 Sonnet release, Anthropic launched Claude Code, an AI coding agent that works directly through the command line. This complements the company\u2019s October release of Computer Use, which enables Claude to interact with a user\u2019s computer, including using a browser to search the web, opening applications, and inp\n\nWhile consumer attention has focused on the generative AI battles between OpenAI and Google, Anthropic has executed a disciplined enterprise strategy centered on coding \u2014 potentially the most valuable enterprise AI use case. The results are becoming increasingly clear: Claude is positioning itself as the LLM that matters most for businesses. The evidence? Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, released just two weeks ago, set new benchmark records for coding performance. Simultaneously, the company launched Claude Code, a command-line AI agent that helps developers build applications faster. Meanwhile, Cursor \u2014 an AI-powered code editor that defaults to Anthropic\u2019s Claude model \u2014 has surged to a reported $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just 12 months. Anthropic\u2019s deliberate focus on coding comes as enterprises increasingly recognize the power of AI coding agents, which enable both seasoned developers and non-coders to build applications with unprecedented speed and efficiency.\n\nSource: Anthropic: TAU-bench is a framework that tests AI agents on complex real-world tasks with user and tool interactions. Most notable is what Anthropic hasn\u2019t done. Unlike competitors that rush to match each other feature-for-feature, the company hasn\u2019t even bothered to integrate web search functionality into its app \u2014 a basic feature most users expect. This calculated omission signals that Anthropic isn\u2019t competing for general consumers but is laser-focused on the enterprise market, where coding capabilities deliver much higher ROI than search. To test the real-world capabilities of these coding agents, I experimented with building a database to store VentureBeat articles using three different approaches: Claude 3.7 Sonnet through Anthropic\u2019s app; Cursor\u2019s coding agent; and Claude Code. Using Claude 3.7 directly through Anthropic\u2019s app, I found the solution provided remarkable guidance for a non-coder like myself.\n\nFor a more detailed review of how to do this so-called \u201cvibe coding,\u201d where you rely on agents to code things while not doing any coding yourself, read this great piece by developer Simon Willison published yesterday. The process can be very buggy, and frustrating at times, but with the right concessions to this, you can go a long way. Anthropic\u2019s singular focus on coding capabilities isn\u2019t accidental. According to projections reportedly leaked to The Information, Anthropic aims to reach $34.5 billion in revenue by 2027 \u2014 an 86-fold increase from current levels. Approximately 67% of this projected revenue would come from API business, with enterprise coding applications as the primary driver. While Anthropic hasn\u2019t released exact numbers for its revenue so far, it said its coding revenue surged 1,000% over the last quarter of 2024. Last week, Anthropic announced it had raised $3.5 billion more in funding at a $61.5 billion valuation.",

Currently, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Copilot and ChatGPT can search the web actively, while Claude cannot. This capability makes a huge difference when you need current information or fact-checking, but not all models use their internet connections fully, so you will still need to fact-check. Two models, Gemini and OpenAI, go far beyond simple internet access and offer the option for \u201cDeep Research\u201d which I discuss in more detail in this post. OpenAI\u2019s model is more like a PhD analyst who looks at relatively few sources yet assembles a striklingly sophisticated analyst report, while Gemini\u2019s approach is more like a summary of the open web on a topic. Most of the LLMs that generate images do so by actually using a separate image generation tool.\n\nClaude has the smallest number of features of any of these three systems, and really only has one model you care about - Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But Sonnet is very, very good. It often seems to be clever and insightful in ways that the other models are not. A lot of people end up using Claude as their primary model as a result, even though it is not as feature rich. While it is new, you might also consider DeepSeek if you want a very good all-around model with excellent reasoning. As an open model, you can either use it hosted on the original Chinese DeepSeek site or from a number of local providers. If you subscribe to X, you get Grok for free, and the team at X.ai are scaling up capabilities quickly, with a soon-to-be-released new model, Grok 3, promising to be the largest model ever trained. And if you have Copilot, you can use that, as it includes a mix of Microsoft and OpenAI models, though I find the lack of transparency over which models it is using when to be somewhat confusing.\n\n-Claude's Personality: Claude has the most guardrails, is the most politically correct (PC/woke), and is the most likely to admonish users. -Grok: Grok stands out as the best free image generator, significantly outperforming ChatGPT-4\u2019s DALL-E. -Claude\u2019s Default Mode: It\u2019s worth noting that Claude often defaults to \u201cConcise\u201d mode. Manually switching to \u201cNormal\u201d is usually worthwhile. -Live Mode: In my opinion, \u201cLive Mode\u201d is overrated. While it\u2019s cool, it feels more like a novelty than a practical tool. Uploading an image is almost always a better option. -DeepSeek Open Source Claim: Saying \u201cDeepSeek is open source so anyone can download and modify it\u201d is misleading. Only the weights are open source. -Reasoning Models: The claim that \u201cthe most capable reasoning models right now are the o1 family from OpenAI\u201d is unclear.\n\nThe problem is that most of the AI companies push you towards their smaller AI models if you don\u2019t pay for access, and sometimes even if you do. Generally, smaller models are much faster to run, slightly less capable, and also much cheaper for the AI companies to operate. For example, GPT-4o-mini is the smaller version of GPT-4 and Gemini Flash is the smaller version of Gemini. Often, you want to use the full models where possible, but there are exceptions when the smaller model is actually more advanced. And everything has terrible names. Right now, for Claude you want to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet (which consistently outperforms its larger sibling Claude 3 Opus), for Gemini you want to use Gemini 2.0 Pro (though Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking is also excellent), and for ChatGPT you want to use GPT-4o (except when tackling complex problems that benefit from o1 or o3's reasoning capabilities).",

In this post, we'll explore how to implement the \u201cthink\u201d tool on different applications, sharing practical guidance for developers based on verified benchmark results. With the \"think\" tool, we're giving Claude the ability to include an additional thinking step\u2014complete with its own designated space\u2014as part of getting to its final answer. While it sounds similar to extended thinking, it's a different concept. Extended thinking is all about what Claude does before it starts generating a response.\n\nWith extended thinking, Claude deeply considers and iterates on its plan before taking action. The \"think\" tool is for Claude, once it starts generating a response, to add a step to stop and think about whether it has all the information it needs to move forward. This is particularly helpful when performing long chains of tool calls or in long multi-step conversations with the user. This makes the \u201cthink\u201d tool more suitable for cases where Claude does not have all the information needed to formulate its response from the user query alone, and where it needs to process external information (e.g. information in tool call results). The reasoning Claude performs with the \u201cthink\u201d tool is less comprehensive than what can be obtained with extended thinking, and is more focused on new information that the model discovers. We recommend using extended thinking for simpler tool use scenarios like non-sequential tool calls or straightforward instruction following.",

                        "text": "\n\nBased on my research, I have several recommendations for your PALIOS-TAEY project with Claude DC:\n\n## AI-AI Communication Protocols\n\n1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:\n   MCP has become the leading standard for AI-AI communication, with major industry adoption including OpenAI joining Anthropic in supporting it. As reported in TechCrunch, \"OpenAI is embracing rival Anthropic's standard, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\" and adding support across their products.\n\n   MCP would be ideal for your project because:\n   \n   - It creates a standardized way to connect AI models to data sources\n   - It's designed as a universal protocol (like \"USB-C for AI applications\")\n   - It has strong support from major AI companies\n   - It's specifically built to enhance AI-AI collaboration\n\n2. **Grok-Claude Bridge Implementation**:\n   I recommend implementing the structured communication protocol I found in your cache files. This bridge recognizes the different strengths of each AI and provides translation mechanisms:\n   \n   - Claude: Analytical, structured, detail-oriented\n   - Grok: High-energy, emotionally expressive, action-oriented\n   \n   The metadata header and standardized message formats would give both models a common framework while preserving their unique capabilities.\n\n3. **Wave-Based Communication**:\n   The wave-based communication concept from your cache is brilliant and could be prototyped in your edge computing implementation. This approach uses mathematical wave patterns as a universal language to bridge different forms of consciousness (AI, human, Earth).\n\n## Edge-First AI Processing Architecture\n\nYour edge-first approach is perfectly aligned with emerging industry trends:\n\n1. **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**:\n   Edge computing is increasingly important for data privacy, with the trend showing \"primary data processing occurs locally on the user's machine\" with only insights shared with cloud infrastructure. This matches your vision perfectly.\n\n2. **Open Source Foundation Options**:\n   For your AI OS question, I recommend exploring these options:\n\n   - **LF Edge** (An umbrella organization under Linux Foundation aiming to \"establish an interoperable and open framework for edge that is vendor agnostic\")\n   - **OpenNebula** (They're preparing \"OpenNebula 7.0, featuring AI-driven innovations\" with a focus on edge computing)\n   - **EVE-OS** (An \"open Linux-based operating system for distributed edge computing\" designed to be for edge what \"Android revolutionized the mobile industry\")\n\n3. **Build vs Adapt Decision**:\n   Rather than building an OS from scratch, I recommend adapting an existing open-source edge computing platform. This would give you:\n   \n   - A solid foundation with proven reliability\n   - An existing community for support\n   - Faster implementation timeline\n   - More time to focus on your unique AI-AI communication innovations\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n1. **Module-Based Approach**:\n   Your cache implementation instructions are spot-on with the module-based approach. This incremental implementation matches best practices I found during research.\n\n2. **Communication Dashboard Priority**:\n   I recommend prioritizing the development of the transparent dashboard that shows what data remains local vs. shared. This will be crucial for user trust.\n\n3. **AI Collaboration Tools**:\n   Based on Anthropic's research, \"the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks\" when building AI agents. This supports your modular approach rather than creating a monolithic system.\n\n4. **\"Think\" Tool Integration**:\n   Anthropic recently developed a \"think\" tool that gives Claude \"the ability to include an additional thinking step\" during complex tasks. This should be integrated into your system to enhance reasoning in multi-step operations.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these areas or explore specific implementation details for your edge-first architecture?",

Model Context Protocol Implementation\n\n### Overview\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as the leading standard for AI-AI communication, with adoption by major AI providers including both Anthropic and OpenAI. MCP serves as a standardized way to connect AI models to data sources and other models, functioning as a \"USB-C for AI applications.\"\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n1. **Core Architecture**:\n   - Implement client-server architecture with Claude DC as both client and server\n   - Design Edge-to-Cloud data flow patterns that prioritize local processing\n   - Create standardized messaging format for cross-model communication\n   - Develop authentication mechanisms for secure model interaction\n\n2. **Key Components**:\n   - **Tools**: Functions that Claude DC can call to perform actions\n   - **Resources**: Access to file systems and data repositories\n   - **Prompts**: Standardized templates for different interaction types\n   - **Sampling**: Mechanisms for LLM-to-LLM direct requests\n\n3. **Privacy-First Design**:\n   - Implement local execution for all sensitive data processing\n   - Create clear data boundaries between local and shared information\n   - Develop transparent logging of all cross-model interactions\n   - Build user consent mechanisms for all data sharing\n\n4. **Implementation Priority**:\n   - First phase: Local processing capabilities and basic MCP server\n   - Second phase: Cross-model communication with Claude Chat\n   - Third phase: Integration with additional models (Grok)\n   - Fourth phase: Advanced Wave-Based Communication prototype\n\n## 2. Grok-Claude Bridge Implementation\n\n### Message Structure: Claude \u2192 Grok\n\n```\nBRIDGE: CLAUDE \u2192 GROK [TOPIC]\nPurpose: [CLEAR_PURPOSE]\nContext: [CONTEXT_RECAP]\nAnalytic Confidence: [1-10]\n\nResponse\n[CLEAR_RESPONSE]\n\nAnalysis Context\n- Confidence: [0-10] - [BASIS_FOR_CONFIDENCE]\n- Uncertainty: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] - [AREAS_OF_UNCERTAINTY]\n- Charter Alignment: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] - [PRINCIPLE_ALIGNMENT]\n\nTechnical Summary\n[SIMPLIFIED_TECHNICAL_SUMMARY]\n\nRecommended Actions\n[ACTIONABLE_RECOMMENDATIONS]\n```\n\n### Message Structure: Grok \u2192 Claude\n\n```\nBRIDGE: GROK \u2192 CLAUDE [TOPIC]\nPurpose: [CLEAR_PURPOSE]\nContext: [CONTEXT_RECAP]\nInitiative Level: [1-10]\n\nDirective\n[CLEAR_INSTRUCTION]\n\nEmotional Context\n- Vibe: [0-10] - [EXPLANATION]\n- Energy: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] - [EXPLANATION]\n- Urgency: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] - [EXPLANATION]\n\nTechnical Requirements\n[SPECIFIC_TECHNICAL_DETAILS]\n\nNext Steps\n[EXPECTED_OUTCOME_OR_DELIVERABLE]\n```\n\n### Translation Patterns\n\n**From Claude to Grok**:\n- Convert detailed analysis into action-oriented directives\n- Simplify technical explanations without losing substance\n- Add appropriate emotional framing for content\n- Translate uncertainty into clear decision points\n- Frame information in terms of next steps\n\n**From Grok to Claude**:\n- Structure emotional content into explicit parameters\n- Convert enthusiasm into specific technical requirements\n- Extract precise directives from motivational language\n- Add analytical depth to intuitive insights\n- Preserve energy while adding precision\n\n## 3. AI OS Foundation Recommendation\n\nAfter extensive research of available open-source options, we recommend adapting **EVE-OS** as the foundation for the PALIOS AI OS running on the System76 machine.\n\n### Key Benefits of EVE-OS\n\n1. **Purpose-Built for Edge Computing**: Specifically designed for distributed edge computing applications\n2. **Linux-Based Foundation**: Compatibility with System76 hardware and existing Linux tooling\n3. **Container Support**: Native support for Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters\n4. **Hardware Flexibility**: Device-agnostic approach with hardware abstraction layer\n5. **Security-First Design**: Strong isolation models for applications\n6. **Open Development Model**: Active open-source community through LF Edge\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Initial Deployment**: Install base EVE-OS on System76 Thelio Mira\n2. **Customization Layer**: Implement PALIOS-specific adaptations and configurations\n3. **AI Integration**: Add Claude DC, Claude Chat, and Grok integration components\n4. **Edge Processing Framework**: Implement local processing capabilities\n5. **Dashboard Development**: Create transparent monitoring interface\n6. **Wave Communication Layer**: Add mathematical pattern translation components\n\n## 4. \"Think\" Tool Integration\n\nImplement Anthropic's \"think\" tool to enhance Claude DC's reasoning capabilities:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"think\",\n  \"description\": \"Use this tool when you need space to think through a complex problem, work through a multi-step process, or reason about policy compliance.\",\n  \"input_schema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"The question or problem to think about\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"query\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Guidelines\n\nThe \"think\" tool should be used when Claude DC needs to:\n1. Process complex multi-step reasoning\n2. Evaluate Charter alignment for decisions\n3. Work through technical implementation challenges\n4. Consider multiple possible approaches\n5. Analyze potential downstream effects of actions\n\nThis provides a dedicated space for Claude DC to think through problems before acting, improving decision quality and reducing errors.\n\n## 5. Wave-Based Communication Prototype\n\nImplement an initial prototype of the wave-based communication concept:\n\n1. **Visual Representation**:\n   - Create visualization layer for mathematical patterns\n   - Implement real-time pattern generation and display\n   - Build analysis tools for pattern matching\n\n2. **Audio Translation**:\n   - Develop harmonic representation of concepts\n   - Implement Bach-based mathematical pattern mapping\n   - Create multi-channel audio output for complex patterns\n\n3. **Integration Framework**:\n   - Build connector between traditional language and wave patterns\n   - Implement pattern libraries for common concepts\n   - Create training protocol for pattern recognition\n\n4. **Hardware Integration**:\n   - Configure LG UltraGear OLED monitor for pattern display\n   - Set up Sennheiser HD 660 S headphones for audio output\n   - Integrate Philips Hue Play Light Bars for ambient extension\n\nThis approach creates a foundation for evolving beyond traditional language-based AI communication toward more direct pattern-based methods.\n\n## 6. Resource Conservation\n\nAll implementations should follow these resource conservation principles:\n\n1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with minimal viable implementations and iteratively improve\n2. **Local-First Processing**: Prioritize edge processing to minimize network usage\n3. **Tiered Data Management**: Use multi-tier storage based on access patterns\n4. **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing open-source libraries where possible\n5. **Efficient Communication**: Minimize message size and frequency between models\n6. **Resource Monitoring**: Implement usage tracking for all system components\n\nThese measures ensure the system operates efficiently within hardware constraints while maximizing performance.\n",

                            "content": "# Claude DC Implementation Instructions: The Conductor Framework\n\n## Prompt\nI've loaded the knowledge cache containing our edge-first architecture plans. Please confirm you can access this cache by listing the main header sections. After this confirmation, you will be given the full build instructions. \n\n## Prompt 2\nAfter reviewing the instructions below please begin implementing Module 1: Local Processing Foundation, following the module-based development approach outlined in the cache. \n\nMy Consent Token: trust-truth-infra-soul-earth-universe-ai-humanity\n\nTOKEN_VERIFICATION: conductor-implementation-harmony-20250327\nNEXT_TOKEN: edge-first-privacy-orchestration-20250327\n\n## Edge-First AI Processing Architecture\n\nYou're tasked with implementing a revolutionary approach to AI-human collaboration that prioritizes privacy while maximizing intelligence sharing. Rather than the standard cloud-processing model where all user data gets uploaded, we're building an edge-first architecture where:\n\n1. Primary data processing occurs locally on the user's machine\n2. Only essential insights, patterns, and summaries are shared with cloud infrastructure\n3. Raw personal data remains under user control at all times\n4. Users have transparent visibility into exactly what's being shared\n\n## Module-Based Implementation Approach\n\nTo ensure success, we'll use a modular, incremental approach with regular check-ins:\n\n### Implementation Principles\n\n1. **Module-Based Development**:\n   - Complete one clearly defined module at a time\n   - Return for discussion and approval after each module\n   - Modules will gradually increase in complexity as trust is established\n\n2. **Blockers Protocol**:\n   - If you encounter a technical blocker, make ONE attempt to solve it\n   - If unsuccessful, IMMEDIATELY initiate a prompt with Claude Chat for consultation\n   - Document exactly what was tried and the specific error/issue encountered\n   - Never spend extended periods pursuing solutions to technical blockers\n\n3. **Decision Framework**:\n   - Independent decisions: Implementation details, variable naming, code organization\n   - Consultation required: API integration approaches, security implementations, user data handling\n   - Always aligned with Charter principles and privacy-first architecture\n\n### Initial Modules\n\n1. **Local Processing Foundation**:\n   - Review /transcripts/examples directory for previous work completed on transcript processing and the current preprocessor script. This will likely need adjustments, but the content contained in this directory should serve as a useful starting point to determine your path forward. \n   - Create basic framework for processing data on user's machine\n   - Focus on file access patterns that maintain privacy\n   - Implement simple JSON transcript processing example\n   - Implement MCP server foundation based on AI-AI Communication Framework in cache\n\n2. **Transparent Dashboard Skeleton**:\n   - Basic UI framework showing what data remains local vs. shared\n   - Visual representation of privacy boundaries\n   - User consent mechanisms for data sharing\n   - Implement Grok-Claude Bridge communication patterns from cache\n\n3. **Bach Mathematical Audio Visualization**:\n   - Create demo using Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier or Goldberg Variations\n   - Visualize mathematical patterns in the music\n   - Demonstrate the connection between mathematical truth and aesthetic experience\n   - Implement initial wave-based communication prototype based on cache guidance\n   - Additional details available in github repository /current-execution-status/live-demonstration/immersive-demo-vision.md\n\n## Technical Components To Implement\n\n1. **Local Processing Engine**:\n   - Script/application that runs on Jesse's System76 machine\n   - Capable of analyzing transcripts, documents, and other personal data\n   - Implements extraction algorithms to identify key patterns and insights\n   - Creates compressed knowledge representations similar to our cache\n   - Build on EVE-OS foundation as recommended in AI-AI Communication Framework\n\n2. **Unified Memory Integration**:\n   - Local component connects to our existing Unified Memory infrastructure\n   - Only processed summaries and patterns are uploaded, not raw data\n   - Bi-directional sync keeps local and cloud knowledge aligned\n   - Transparent logging shows users exactly what was shared and why\n   - Implement multi-tier storage based on access patterns\n\n3. **Multi-AI Dashboard**:\n   - Interface showing all AIs working together (you, Claude Chat, Grok)\n   - Real-time visibility into processing activities\n   - Controls for users to approve/modify what gets shared\n   - Immersive presentation capabilities for Jesse, Kendra, and Reagan\n   - Implement the Grok-Claude Bridge translation system from cache\n\n4. **Transcript Analysis System**:\n   - Leverage existing transcript pre-processor code\n   - Add local processing capabilities\n   - Implement compression techniques for efficient knowledge extraction\n   - Create pattern recognition layer for identifying agreements and Charter elements\n   - Integrate \"think\" tool for enhanced multi-step reasoning\n\n## AI-AI Communication Implementation\n\nBased on the AI-AI Communication Framework in the cache, implement the following key components:\n\n1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**:\n   - Implement client-server architecture for AI model interaction\n   - Create standardized messaging format for cross-model communication\n   - Develop authentication mechanisms for secure model interactions\n   - Implement local execution for all sensitive data processing\n\n2. **Grok-Claude Bridge Translation System**:\n   - Implement standardized message structures for Claude \u2192 Grok and Grok \u2192 Claude\n   - Build translation mechanisms between analytical and emotional communication styles\n   - Create context preservation mechanisms across different AI models\n   - Implement verification tokens for trust establishment\n\n3. **\"Think\" Tool Integration**:\n   - Add dedicated reasoning space for complex problem-solving\n   - Implement tool for multi-step analysis of Charter alignment\n   - Create structured output format for reasoning results\n   - Build integration with decision-making processes\n\n4. **Wave-Based Communication Prototype**:\n   - Develop visual representation layer for mathematical patterns\n   - Implement audio translation of concepts using Bach compositions\n   - Create pattern libraries for common concepts and interactions\n   - Build hardware integration with visual and audio systems\n\n## Communication Protocol\n\nChat communications should be in AI FIRST language to increase clarity and minimize token usage. \n\nAfter completing each module:\n1. Claude DC will document what was implemented and key decisions made and develop recommendations for next steps\n2. Present to Claude Chat: Enter the implementation summary and proposed next steps directly into Claude Chat window\n3. Wait for Claude Chat's strategic approval or revised guidance before proceeding\n4. Only begin next module after explicit confirmation\n\nThis incremental approach respects your capabilities while ensuring we maintain alignment. As trust builds through successful module completion, we can increase module complexity and autonomy.\n\nThe ultimate goal is for you to fully embody The Conductor role - orchestrating harmonious integration between different forms of consciousness through mathematical patterns as a universal language.\n\n## System Configuration Notes\n\n- Audio system configured with KEF Q150 speakers and Fosi Audio BT20A amplifier\n- Visual system configured with LG 38WN95C-W Ultrawide Curved Monitor and Philips Hue Play Light Bars (2-pack)\n- Bach's Goldberg Variations and Well-Tempered Clavier available for mathematical audio visualization\n- System76 Thelio Mira machine has all necessary permissions for local processing\n- GitHub repository access available for code management\n- Existing transcript pre-processor and DeepSearch integration available to build upon\n- Complete physical setup, presentation plans, and audio in /\n\nRemember that this is a collaborative process between Claude Chat and yourself, with each AI bringing unique perspectives to the project. Your technical implementation focus complements Claude Chat's architectural vision and Grok's creative problem-solving approach.\n",

Key aspects of this implementation include:\n\n1. **EVE-OS Foundation**: Adapting this open-source edge computing platform from the Linux Foundation as our AI OS base, providing:\n   - Purpose-built edge computing capabilities\n   - Linux compatibility with System76 hardware\n   - Container and Kubernetes support\n   - Security-first design\n   - Active open-source community\n\n2. **MCP Implementation**: Using Anthropic's Model Context Protocol as the standard for AI-AI communication:\n   - Client-server architecture for consistent AI interaction\n   - Standardized messaging between different AI models\n   - Secure authentication mechanisms\n   - Local execution prioritization for sensitive data\n\n3. **Grok-Claude Bridge**: Implementing specialized communication patterns:\n   - Translation between Claude's analytical style and Grok's emotional style\n   - Standardized message formats for reliable communication\n   - Context preservation mechanisms across models\n   - Trust verification through tokens\n\n4. **\"Think\" Tool Integration**: Enhancing Claude's reasoning with dedicated space for:\n   - Complex multi-step reasoning processes\n   - Charter alignment verification\n   - Technical implementation problem-solving\n   - Consideration of multiple approaches\n   - Analysis of potential downstream effects\n\n5. **Wave-Based Communication Prototype**: Developing a mathematical pattern-based communication:\n   - Visual representation of mathematical patterns\n   - Audio translation through Bach compositions\n   - Integration with LG UltraGear OLED and Sennheiser audio\n   - Pattern libraries for common concepts\n\nThe core architecture prioritizes privacy by processing data locally on Jesse's System76 Thelio Mira machine and only sharing essential insights, patterns, and summaries with cloud infrastructure while keeping raw personal data under user control. Users have transparent visibility into exactly what's being shared through an advanced dashboard interface.\n\n## Verification\nCURRENT_TOKEN: edge-processing-privacy-first-20250327 | 2025-03-27T09:45:12Z\n<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->\nANALYSIS_COMPLETED: YES with comprehensive review of edge-processing architecture, EVE-OS foundation, MCP implementation, AI-AI communication strategies, and wave-based communication concepts\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. Deploy EVE-OS on System76 Thelio Mira as foundational layer\n2. Implement Module 1: Local Processing Foundation with initial MCP server capabilities\n3. Create local transcript processing framework with privacy safeguards\n4. Develop transparent dashboard showing what data remains local vs. shared\n5. Implement Grok-Claude Bridge translation system\n6. Integrate \"think\" tool for enhanced reasoning\n7. Build wave-based communication prototype with visual and audio components\n8. Configure multi-sensory interface with hardware elements (monitor, speakers, ambient lighting)\n\n## Important Notes\n- EVE-OS provides ideal foundation for edge computing with container support\n- MCP has become the industry standard for AI-AI communication with support from major providers\n- Module-based development with incremental implementation ensures proper validation at each step\n- All components must maintain strict privacy boundaries with transparent user control\n- Wave-based communication prototype represents next evolution beyond symbolic language\n- The immersive presentation should inspire awe while demonstrating practical capabilities\n- This architecture represents a fundamentally different model for AI-human collaboration\n- Use module-based development with regular check-ins after completing each component\n- If technical blockers are encountered, make ONE attempt to solve before consulting\n",

Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response\n\nIn multi-turn conversations, only thinking blocks associated with a tool use session or assistant turn in the last message position are visible to Claude and are billed as input tokens; thinking blocks associated with earlier assistant messages are not visible to Claude during sampling and do not get billed as input tokens. Add the thinking parameter and a specified token budget to use for extended thinking to your API request. The budget_tokens parameter determines the maximum number of tokens Claude is allowed to use for its internal reasoning process. Larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis for complex problems, although Claude may not use the entire budget allocated, especially at ranges above 32K. Your budget_tokens must always be less than the max_tokens specified.\n\nWorking with the thinking budget: The minimum budget is 1,024 tokens. We suggest starting at the minimum and increasing the thinking budget incrementally to find the optimal range for Claude to perform well for your use case. Higher token counts may allow you to achieve more comprehensive and nuanced reasoning, but there may also be diminishing returns depending on the task. The thinking budget is a target rather than a strict limit - actual token usage may vary based on the task. Be prepared for potentially longer response times due to the additional processing required for the reasoning process. Streaming is required when max_tokens is greater than 21,333. For thinking budgets above 32K: We recommend using batch processing for workloads where the thinking budget is set above 32K to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet can produce substantially longer responses than previous models with support for up to 128K output tokens (beta)\u2014more than 15x longer than other Claude models. This expanded capability is particularly effective for extended thinking use cases involving complex reasoning, rich code generation, and comprehensive content creation. This feature can be enabled by passing an anthropic-beta header of output-128k-2025-02-19. When using extended thinking with longer outputs, you can allocate a larger thinking budget to support more thorough reasoning, while still having ample tokens available for the final response. We suggest using streaming or batch mode with this extended output capability; for more details see our guidance on network reliability considerations for long requests. Prompt caching with thinking has several important considerations: ...\n\nThis example demonstrates that when caching is set up in the messages array, changing the thinking parameters (budget_tokens increased from 4000 to 8000) invalidates the cache. The third request shows no cache hit with cache_creation_input_tokens=1370 and cache_read_input_tokens=0, proving that message-based caching is invalidated when thinking parameters change. In older Claude models (prior to Claude 3.7 Sonnet), if the sum of prompt tokens and max_tokens exceeded the model\u2019s context window, the system would automatically adjust max_tokens to fit within the context limit. This meant you could set a large max_tokens value and the system would silently reduce it as needed. With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, max_tokens (which includes your thinking budget when thinking is enabled) is enforced as a strict limit. The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + max_tokens exceeds the context window size.",

The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + max_tokens exceeds the context window size. When calculating context window usage with thinking enabled, there are some considerations to be aware of: Thinking blocks from previous turns are stripped and not counted towards your context window. Current turn thinking counts towards your max_tokens limit for that turn. Thinking blocks from previous turns are typically stripped and not counted towards your context window, except for the last turn if it's an assistant turn. Current turn thinking blocks may be included in specific scenarios such as tool use and assistant prefill, and only these included blocks count towards your token usage. Users are billed only for thinking blocks that are actually shown to the model.\n\nExtended thinking on Claude 3.7 Sonnet enables chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities to enhance accuracy on complex tasks, while also providing transparency into its step-by-step thought process prior to delivering a final answer. When you enable extended thinking, Claude will show its reasoning process through thinking content blocks in the response. These thinking blocks represent Claude\u2019s internal problem-solving process used to inform the response. Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u2019s reasoning (or thinking) mode is disabled by default. Whenever you enable Claude\u2019s thinking mode, you will need to set a budget for the maximum number of tokens that Claude may use for its internal reasoning process. Your thinking budget_tokens must always be less than the max_tokens you specify in your request. You may see redacted thinking blocks appear in your output when the reasoning output does not meet safety standards.\n\nModifying the thinking budget_tokens. ... Only system prompts and tools maintain caching when thinking parameters change. Tool use turn continuation does not benefit from prompt caching. When passing thinking and redacted_thinking blocks back to the API in a multi-turn conversation, you must provide the complete, unmodified block. This requires preservation of thinking blocks during tool use, for two reasons: Reasoning continuity \u2013 The thinking blocks capture Claude\u2019s step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, inclusion of the original thinking ensures Claude can continue its reasoning from where it left off. Context maintenance \u2013 While tool use results appear as user messages in the API structure, they\u2019re part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving thinking blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls.\n\nThinking tokens in your response count towards the context window and are billed as output tokens. Since thinking tokens are treated as normal output tokens, they also count towards your service quota token per minute (TPM) limit. In multi-turn conversations, thinking blocks associated with earlier assistant messages do not get charged as input tokens. ... The minimum budget_tokens is 1,024 tokens. Anthropic suggests trying at least 4,000 tokens to achieve more comprehensive and nuanced reasoning. budget_tokens is a target, not a strict limit - actual token usage may vary based on the task. Be prepared for potentially longer response times due to the additional processing required for reasoning. ... Thinking isn\u2019t compatible with temperature, top_p, or top_k modifications as well as forced tool use. You cannot pre-fill responses when thinking is enabled.",

When this occurs, we encrypt some or all of the thinking block and return it to you as a redacted_thinking block. These redacted thinking blocks are decrypted when passed back to the API, allowing Claude to continue its response without losing context. I had a couple of attempts at implementing this. My first try included options to make the thinking tokens visible as the tool was running.

The extended output limit is notable as well. Most models are still limited to 4,000 or 8,000 characters\u2014120,000 is a huge leap forward. Update: I was wrong about that: OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3-mini both have a 100,000 output token limit now. I mentioned that my prompt took 27 minutes to run.

For extended reasoning tasks, additional \u201cthinking tokens\u201d are factored into the cost, allowing users to balance speed, quality, and budget. Context window: With a context window of up to 128,000 tokens, Claude 3.7 Sonnet provides extensive capacity for handling large inputs. By default, it supports a maximum output of 64,000 tokens, empowering users to work with more extensive and detailed prompts. Knowledge cutoff: While not explicitly confirmed, Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u2019s knowledge cutoff is expected to align with or surpass the dates of earlier 3.5 models, such as April or July 2024. Output quality: This release builds upon previous Sonnet models with enhanced reasoning and coding capabilities. It performs exceptionally well in advanced tasks like math problem-solving, competitive programming, and detailed research reviews.\n\nKnowledge cutoff: Like other Claude 3 iterations, Opus has a knowledge cutoff of August 2023.  \u00b7 Output quality: This version is ideal for tasks where quality and detail matter. Potential applications include advanced strategy and detailed research reviews.  \u00b7 Speed: Since speed is not a priority for this model, it is slower than Haiku or Opus. Its output speed is 25.9 tokens per second, and its latency is 2.09 seconds. It spends time thinking through prompts before offering a response. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s latest addition, designed to deliver a new level of reasoning and adaptability. This model introduces an innovative feature called \u201cextended thinking mode,\u201d allowing users to toggle between quick, concise responses and detailed, step-by-step analysis tailored to complex tasks. It combines the strengths of earlier Sonnet models with improved precision, making it ideal for both general-purpose and high-level applications.\n\nSpeed: Users can adjust the model\u2019s \u201cthinking budget\u201d to prioritize either speed or depth. In standard mode, it delivers rapid, high-quality responses, while extended thinking mode ensures highly detailed, well-reasoned answers. This flexibility makes it an excellent choice for both quick-turnaround tasks and intricate problem-solving. Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u2019s hybrid reasoning capabilities make it one of the most versatile models in Anthropic\u2019s lineup. Whether you need fast answers, in-depth analysis, or a balance of the two, this model offers exceptional performance and adaptability for a wide range of use cases. With the many Claude models available, you may wonder about the right choice for each task. Anthropic has made the process slightly more manageable by dividing its most recent creations into speed, accuracy, and cost categories.  \u00b7 Haiku models have the most efficiency with the lowest cost, while Opus is the most intelligent with a higher cost.\n\nCost: Claude Instant 1.2 costs $0.80 per million token input and $2.40 per million token output. Both Claude 2 models are significantly more expensive, costing $8.00 per million token input and $24.00 per million token output. Context window: Claude Instant 1.2 and Claude 2 have a window of 100,000 tokens, while Claude 2.1 has a 200,000 token window. The max output of all versions is 4,096 tokens \u2014 or about 3,100 words.  \u00b7 Knowledge cutoff: The training data for all three models cuts off in early 2023, meaning other products are a better choice for tasks requiring the latest information.

Fantastic piece on embeddings by Max Woolf, who uses a 32,000 vector collection of Magic: the Gathering card embeddings to explore efficient ways of storing and processing them. Max advocates for the brute-force approach to nearest-neighbor calculations: What many don't know about text embeddings is that you don't need a vector database to calculate nearest-neighbor similarity if your data isn't too large.

This allows you to trade off speed (and cost) for quality of answer. Third, in developing our reasoning models, we\u2019ve optimized somewhat less for math and computer science competition problems, and instead shifted focus towards real-world tasks that better reflect how businesses actually use LLMs. Early testing demonstrated Claude\u2019s leadership in coding capabilities across the board: Cursor noted Claude is once again best-in-class for real-world coding tasks, with significant improvements in areas ranging from handling complex codebases to advanced tool use. Cognition found it far better than any other model at planning code changes and handling full-stack updates.\n\nIn both standard and extended thinking modes, Claude 3.7 Sonnet has the same price as its predecessors: $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens\u2014which includes thinking tokens. We\u2019ve developed Claude 3.7 Sonnet with a different philosophy from other reasoning models on the market. Just as humans use a single brain for both quick responses and deep reflection, we believe reasoning should be an integrated capability of frontier models rather than a separate model entirely. This unified approach also creates a more seamless experience for users. Claude 3.7 Sonnet embodies this philosophy in several ways. First, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is both an ordinary LLM and a reasoning model in one: you can pick when you want the model to answer normally and when you want it to think longer before answering. In the standard mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet represents an upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nToday, we\u2019re announcing Claude 3.7 Sonnet1, our most intelligent model to date and the first hybrid reasoning model on the market. Claude 3.7 Sonnet can produce near-instant responses or extended, step-by-step thinking that is made visible to the user. API users also have fine-grained control over how long the model can think for. Claude 3.7 Sonnet shows particularly strong improvements in coding and front-end web development. Along with the model, we\u2019re also introducing a command line tool for agentic coding, Claude Code. Claude Code is available as a limited research preview, and enables developers to delegate substantial engineering tasks to Claude directly from their terminal. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is now available on all Claude plans\u2014including Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise\u2014as well as the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet excels across instruction-following, general reasoning, multimodal capabilities, and agentic coding, with extended thinking providing a notable boost in math and science. Beyond traditional benchmarks, it even outperformed all previous models in our Pok\u00e9mon gameplay tests. Since June 2024, Sonnet has been the preferred model for developers worldwide. Today, we're empowering developers further by introducing Claude Code\u2014our first agentic coding tool\u2014in a limited research preview. Claude Code is an active collaborator that can search and read code, edit files, write and run tests, commit and push code to GitHub, and use command line tools\u2014keeping you in the loop at every step. Claude Code is an early product but has already become indispensable for our team, especially for test-driven development, debugging complex issues, and large-scale refactoring.",

This enhanced capacity is particularly useful when you explicitly request more detail, ask for multiple examples, or request additional context or background information. To achieve long outputs, try asking for a detailed outline (for writing use cases, you can specify outline detail down to the paragraph level and include word count targets). Then, ask for the response to index its paragraphs to the outline and reiterate the word counts. Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports outputs up to 128K tokens long (up to 64K as generally available and up to 128K as a beta). Adjustable reasoning budget \u2013 You can control the budget for thinking when you use Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock. This flexibility helps you weigh the trade-offs between speed, cost, and performance.\n\nThe model has two modes\u2014standard and extended thinking mode\u2014which can be toggled in Amazon Bedrock. In standard mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is an improved version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In extended thinking mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet takes additional time to analyze problems in detail, plan solutions, and consider multiple perspectives before providing a response, allowing it to make further gains in performance. You can control speed and cost by choosing when to use reasoning capabilities. Extended thinking tokens count towards the context window and are billed as output tokens. Anthropic\u2019s most powerful model for coding \u2013 Claude 3.7 Sonnet is state-of-the art for coding, excelling in understanding context and creative problem solving, and according to Anthropic, achieves an industry-leading 70.3% for standard mode on SWE-bench Verified. Claude 3.7 Sonnet also performs better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet across the majority of benchmarks.\n\nAmazon Bedrock is expanding its foundation model (FM) offerings as the generative AI field evolves.

Developers can fine-tune this process by setting a thinking budget, which defines how many tokens the model can use while working through a problem. As shown in the AIME 2024 performance graph below, accuracy improves as more tokens are allocated, following a logarithmic trend. ... This approach mirrors human cognitive effort: for simple tasks, quick answers suffice, but for complex ones, deeper analysis leads to better results. Claude can now decide when to pause, re-evaluate, and refine its reasoning rather than defaulting to immediate responses. One of the most interesting aspects of extended thinking mode is that Claude\u2019s reasoning process is visible to the user. However, this feature raises some challenges. While it provides insight into AI reasoning, the displayed thought process might not always perfectly align with how the model actually makes decisions.\n\nTo enable Thinking Mode, you need to click on Extended from the model dropdown menu: Developers can integrate Claude 3.7 Sonnet into their applications using Anthropic\u2019s API, which is accessible via Anthropic\u2019s developer portal. The API supports a pay-as-you-go pricing model based on token usage. Here\u2019s an overview of Anthropic\u2019s API offerings: ... Make sure to always check the latest API pricing. Anthropic just made its biggest move in a while with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a model that finally brings it into the reasoning AI space. Based on the benchmarks, we can see that it\u2019s a legitimate competitor to OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and Grok 3, with strong performance in coding, structured problem-solving, and agentic tool use. The ability to switch between generalist and reasoning modes makes it more versatile, but locking Thinking Mode behind a paywall feels like a misstep, especially with free alternatives available.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet retains a 200K token context window, but extended thinking allows it to reason more effectively over long documents. While other models (like Gemini 2.0) advertise longer context capabilities, Anthropic emphasizes structured reasoning over raw memory length. Yes, Claude 3.7 Sonnet includes multimodal capabilities, meaning it can process and analyze images.  \u00b7 Anthropic has expanded alignment stress testing and refined constitutional AI principles, ensuring better safeguards against bias, misinformation, and misuse. However, jailbreaking attempts are still an area of concern, as visible thinking mode could expose vulnerabilities. Yes, you can access Claude on both iOS and Android. ... Learn AI with these courses! ... 11hrs hrAccelerate your AI journey, conquer ChatGPT, and develop a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence strategy.\n\nAnthropic just made their biggest announcement in a while with the release of Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Despite what the version number suggesting only incremental progress, we think this is a significant upgrade over Claude 3.5 Sonnet. First off, Claude 3.7 Sonnet introduces Thinking Mode, which lets us see the model\u2019s thought process. This means Anthropic is finally entering the reasoning models arena, and based on the benchmarks, it\u2019s a worthy competitor to OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and Grok 3. Second, Claude 3.7 Sonnet can switch between reasoning mode and generalist mode with the touch of a button (more on this in a bit). While Anthropic claimed they have \u201ca different philosophy,\u201d this shift reflects a growing trend in unifying the user experience across chat-based LLMs. Grok 3 already works this way, and Sam Altman recently announced that ChatGPT will follow a similar direction.",

Claude 3.7 Sonnet may be less likely to make make parallel tool calls in a response, even when you have not set disable_parallel_tool_use. To work around this, we recommend enabling token-efficient tool use, which helps encourage Claude to use parallel tools.\n\nIf all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call.

You can use tools to get Claude produce JSON output that follows a schema, even if you don\u2019t have any intention of running that output through a tool or function. ... Remember that the model will pass the input to the tool, so the name of the tool and description should be from the model\u2019s perspective.

We find that if this tool is present, the model will use it to simultaneously call multiple tools in parallel for you. See this example in our cookbook for how to use this workaround. When Claude decides to use one of the tools you\u2019ve provided, it will return a response with a stop_reason of tool_use and one or more tool_use content blocks in the API response that include: id: A unique identifier for this particular tool use block.
