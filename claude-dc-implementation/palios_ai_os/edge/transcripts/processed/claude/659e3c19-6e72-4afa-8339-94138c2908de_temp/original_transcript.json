    " Great progress! We're making significant improvements. Let's analyze what's happening:\n\n1. The memory service is now initializing successfully. This is a big win!\n2. We're now able to create memory contexts. This is working correctly.\n3. However, storing memory items is failing with the error: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`\n4. The transcript processor is still failing with an indentation error, but now on line 433.\n\nLet's fix these remaining issues one by one:\n\n## 1. Fix the Memory Store Issue\n\nThe error message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` suggests that somewhere in the store method, we're trying to call `.get()` on a variable that is actually `None`. Looking at the memory_service.py implementation, there might be an issue in the store method.\n\nLet's identify the specific issue by examining the store function in the memory_service implementation. The error is likely occurring when handling metadata. Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. In the memory_service.py file, look for the `store` method\n2. Look for places where .get() is called on variables that might be None\n3. Specifically, check the following modifications:\n\n```python\n# Find this code in the store method\nmemory_id = metadata.get('memory_id', str(uuid.uuid4()))\n\n# Make sure metadata is not None before calling .get()\nif metadata is None:\n    memory_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\nelse:\n    memory_id = metadata.get('memory_id', str(uuid.uuid4()))\n```\n\nMake similar changes in other places where metadata.get() is used. This ensures that even if metadata is None, the code won't crash.\n\n## 2. Fix the Transcript Processor Indentation Error\n\nThe indentation error has now moved to line 433, which means our previous fix wasn't complete or there's another issue.\n\nLet's examine the transcript_processor.py file around line 433. It's likely that there are more misplaced code blocks that need commenting out or proper indentation.\n\nTo fix this properly:\n\n1. Open transcript_processor.py\n2. Look at line 433 and surrounding code\n3. Check for any indentation inconsistencies\n4. If you find misplaced code like before, comment it out as we did earlier\n\nSince line 433 is after our previous fix on line 418, there's likely another section of misplaced code we missed. Without seeing line 433 directly, we'll need to approach this similarly to how we fixed the last issue.\n\n## Next Steps After Fixing\n\nOnce these issues are fixed:\n\n1. Restart the server\n2. Run the tests again\n3. If all tests pass, we can proceed with developing the documentation and other deliverables\n\nLet me know if you need more specific guidance on fixing these issues based on examining the code at the problematic lines."
