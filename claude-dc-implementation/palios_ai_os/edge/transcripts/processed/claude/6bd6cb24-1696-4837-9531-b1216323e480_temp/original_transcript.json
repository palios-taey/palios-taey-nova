    "Great Claude! Ok, a couple questions:\n1. Previously, you tested the files on your own and developed automated deployment to Cloud Run using terraform. Can you do that again? Also, I'm assuming I will need to remove all the existing files from there, right? So would need guidance on that quickly or automated script/commands to do that. \n2. What about all the other files and modules? Will those be implemented once the core system above is? \n3. For APIs, currently Gemini and OpenAI have been tested with the previous code and successfully completed tasks that were added to Firestore. You and Grok will be the next thing to do with APIs. I have a collection in Firestore for the API keys and have a folder in the root directory as well with them saved there. What's the AI first approach for dealing with these?\n4. We are still working on the format for the chat transcripts, as of now, we are still tweaking the final format of that with DeepSearch, but this is the current format of the output. I can add an additional information on this if needed now as well, just let me know\n[ { \"id\": \"section1\", \"summary\": \"[0.95,0.10,0.85] Plan scale\", \"tags\": [ {\"tag\": \"#STRATEGIC\", \"topic\": \"Project Scaling\", \"related\": \"Growth Strategy\"}, {\"tag\": \"#IDEA_BIG\", \"topic\": \"Expansion Vision\", \"related\": \"Market Reach\"} ] } ]"
