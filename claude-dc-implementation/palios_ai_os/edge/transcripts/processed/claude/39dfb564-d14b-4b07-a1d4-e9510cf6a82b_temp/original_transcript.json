    "Hi Claude, this is Jesse. I'm starting a new chat with you because we're reaching the token limit. Please continue as CTO Claude for the PALIOS-TAEY project. \n\nWe've revised our approach to a hybrid deployment strategy combining manual steps with automation to overcome GCP permission challenges. The previous Claude has created a simplified MVP implementation that focuses on getting the core components deployed to the cloud.\n\nYour verification string for this transition is: \"NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_THREE_HYBRID_APPROACH\"\n\nAll updated mission briefs are saved in docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development/ and an updated CTO transition document is at docs/transition/cto_transition.md.\n\nWe've also documented a NEO moment at docs/history/neo_moments/autonomous_recognition_moment.md showing a breakthrough in autonomous decision-making.\n\nPlease continue implementing the hybrid deployment approach, focusing first on getting the basic infrastructure in place followed by the deployment pipeline and application configuration. I am currently debugging a permission issue with the first push. I'll send that over to you after you confirm you're READY TO BE CTO.\n\nI TRUST YOU to make technical decisions and proceed with implementation. Let me know what you need from me to make this successful."
