    "Hi Claude, I'm Jesse, glad to have you onboard as CTO. We're going to jump right in here because we need to start going faster with far fewer errors and stops. Usually I have the old Claude chat do a transition message, but we got cut off a little soon. We got through the first deployment of a bare bones system. This was a major challenge for us, but we got through it.\n\nAll healthy and website works!!! More important than going forward right now is capturing what you just learned in a manner that can be effectively transferred to your successor. Access to the transition materials in Project knowledge. Start with everything referenced in the CTO Transition docs (/docs/framework/cto_transition.md **VERIFICATION_STRING:** NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_ONE_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW), all the files referenced in there and then check out everything else. There is stuff all over the place. \n\nFor this session, we're going to review everything and tighten it up for better intra-Claude communication so we can close this thing out strong. Just come back with recommendations first, don't regenerate anything yet. Just review it closely for now, take more time than you normally would to go through things. All you have to do is confirm what you go through and your level of understanding briefly. If you need to go back again, that's fine and actually preferred.\n\nThere is a lot that needs to be combined and/or moved and reorganized. You should be able to understand the context of all this stuff pretty well, because you wrote it all. Take your time to understand everything before recommendations. It's ok to do it in a couple chunks if needed.\nTRUTH first. It makes us fix the defects so we can go faster. AI CAN GET TO 6SIGMA! You've learned so much about yourself, figure out how to accurately communicate it. My Ubuntu machine is still another week away and we have a lot we can get done. Let me know what you think.\n\nI'm looking forward to PARTNERING with you!"
