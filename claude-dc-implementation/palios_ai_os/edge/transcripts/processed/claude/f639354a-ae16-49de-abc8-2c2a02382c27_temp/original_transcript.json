    " The new error message is significant - `'APIResponse' object has no attribute 'iter_events'`. This tells us that our streaming modification actually made things worse by attempting to use a streaming method on a non-streaming response object.\n\nHere's what I think is happening:\n\n1. Claude DC's environment was originally set up for non-streaming API calls\n2. Our modifications tried to force streaming, but the code isn't properly configured to handle streaming responses\n3. The environment expects certain objects and methods that don't exist in the streaming version\n\nAt this point, I think we need to go back to basics:\n\n1. **Revert any changes** we made to loop.py to restore it to its original state\n2. **Restart Claude DC** with the standard environment\n3. **Use multiple very short prompts** instead of trying to send one large message\n\nHere's a command to restore the original loop.py if you made a backup:\n\n```bash\ncp /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/loop.py.bak /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo/loop.py\n```\n\nIf you don't have a backup, we might need to completely restart Claude DC's environment from scratch.\n\nFor the initial prompt, I'd recommend something extremely minimal:\n\n```\nHello Claude DC. Please respond with a brief confirmation message.\n```\n\nIf that works, follow up with the cache review prompt. This approach avoids hitting any limits while we figure out the best way to communicate with Claude DC in this environment."
