    "Great Claude, this just keeps getting better and better! Glad to have you aboard as CTO!\n\nWe left off with permissions and I was being asked to create some service accounts. This is the first NOVA implementation and we had several others. Attached is the current IAM for your review. Let me know what's next. Happy to get this cleaned up if you think it's best, we have been doing that as we go throughout this implementation so we can have the right infrastructure to FLY next time. Your call. Let me know."
