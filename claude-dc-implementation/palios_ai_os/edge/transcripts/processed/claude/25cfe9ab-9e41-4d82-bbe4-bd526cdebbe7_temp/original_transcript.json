    " You'll need to provide Claude DC with GitHub username and password credentials, as these are different from the API keys in the secrets file. The API keys allow him to interact with various AI services, but for GitHub access, he'll need the basic authentication details.\n\nYou should include in your prompt:\n\n```\nFor GitHub access via HTTPS, use these credentials:\nUsername: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\nPassword: YOUR_GITHUB_PASSWORD (or personal access token if you use 2FA)\n```\n\nThis will allow him to push changes to the repository when needed. Alternatively, if you're using a personal access token instead of a password (which is more secure and required if you have two-factor authentication enabled), provide that instead.\n\nWith this information, he'll have everything he needs to fully implement and deploy the integrated communication dashboard."
