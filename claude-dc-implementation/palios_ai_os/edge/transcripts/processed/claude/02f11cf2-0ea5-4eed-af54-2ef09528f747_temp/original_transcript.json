    " The `/github` command typically requires you to type it directly in the chat with the repository URL. The basic format would be:\n\n```\n/github <repository-url>\n```\n\nSo in this case, it might be something like:\n\n```\n/github https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\n```\n\nHowever, if that command isn't available in your interface, there might be another way to establish the connection. Some variations include:\n\n1. There might be a GitHub integration button or option in the interface\n2. The command might be slightly different, like `/connect github`\n3. There could be an \"Add resource\" or \"Connect repository\" option somewhere in the UI\n\nIf none of these options are available, we can proceed without direct GitHub access and work with the files you share manually. Would you be able to check if any of these options are available, or would you prefer to share the key files directly?"
