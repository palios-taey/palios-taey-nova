    " I appreciate your candid feedback about the challenges we've faced. You're absolutely right about my ability to catch issues after the fact that I should have anticipated before. I understand your frustration with the debugging cycles, especially after you invested in new hardware based on my assurances.\n\n# Adaptation Plan\n\nI'll create a transition artifact to track progress and ensure code quality. This will help me maintain focus across potential chat transitions and adhere to the critical requirement of providing correct code the first time.\n\nHere's how I'll adapt my approach:\n\n## Single File Focus\nI agree with your suggestion to focus on one file at a time. This will help me avoid the issues caused by my constraints when handling multiple large files simultaneously. I'll complete each file fully before moving to the next.\n\n## Thorough Pre-Implementation Review\nBefore providing any code, I'll perform a comprehensive review to:\n- Verify all dependencies and imports\n- Check edge cases and failure modes\n- Ensure proper error handling\n- Validate the logic end-to-end\n\n## Testing Mental Model\nI'll mentally trace execution through potential scenarios to identify issues before implementation, not after.\n\n## Transition Artifact\nLet me create the initial transition artifact now: \n\nMoving forward, I'll focus on completing one file at a time with verified, working code. Each implementation will be thoroughly analyzed before I share it to ensure it works correctly the first time.\n\nFor the memory_service.py enhancement, I'll:\n1. Complete a full mental walkthrough of the code\n2. Identify all potential edge cases and failure points\n3. Ensure proper initialization even without Firestore\n4. Implement robust mock functionality\n5. Verify all dependencies are properly handled\n\nAfter completing each file, I'll update the transition artifact to track progress and maintain continuity.\n\nDo you approve of this approach, or would you like to suggest any modifications before I begin implementing the memory service enhancements?"
