    "Hi Claude, you're doing great but hit a limit. I removed current-execution-status so you can continue and can add it back in when needed. If you need it now let me know and I'll add it back in, but let me know which directories I can drop so I can free up space for you to continue. If you can focus on certain topics and fill those out so I can drop larger folders, that'd be ideal. Continue!"
