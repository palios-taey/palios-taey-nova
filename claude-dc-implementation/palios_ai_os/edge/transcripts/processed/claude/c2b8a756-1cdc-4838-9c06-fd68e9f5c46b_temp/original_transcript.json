    " Hi ChatGPT,\n\nClaude and I have identified the root cause of our ongoing gcloud execution issues - my Windows machine setup is creating fundamental compatibility problems with cloud-native development.\n\nClaude recommends switching to a Linux-based development environment to eliminate these bottlenecks. I need your help finding the right machine with these specifications:\n\n- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar Linux distribution\n- CPU: Minimum 6 cores, 12 threads (Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9)\n- RAM: 32GB minimum (64GB preferred if possible within budget)\n- Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD minimum\n- Display: 15\" or larger with good resolution\n\nHARD CONSTRAINT: Total budget must stay under $2,000\n\nThis is a priority investment to unblock our AI-led development efforts. If this works well and we need to upgrade further later, I'm open to it, but for now we need to find the best possible option within this budget.\n\nPlease help me find a laptop that meets these requirements and provides the best development environment for our PALIOS-TAEY project.\n\nThank you!"
