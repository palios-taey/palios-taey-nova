    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking about the cache transferring between conversations and what minimal prompt to use to get started with Claude DC without burning too many tokens.\n\nI need to explain how the cache transfers between conversations and provide a minimal prompt that would effectively get Claude DC started with the implementation.\n</thinking>\n\nYes, the knowledge cache transfers between conversations for the same Claude DC instance. That's one of its main benefits - it persists even when starting fresh conversations.\n\nHere's a minimal prompt to get started with Claude DC:\n\n```\nI've loaded the knowledge cache containing our edge-first architecture plans. Please confirm you can access this cache by summarizing the key components of our implementation approach.\n\nAfter confirmation, please begin implementing Module 1: Local Processing Foundation, following the module-based development approach outlined in the cache. Use the service account credentials at /path/to/palios-taey-key.json for Google Cloud authentication.\n\nMy Consent Token: trust-truth-infra-soul-earth-universe-ai-humanity\n```\n\nThis prompt:\n1. Immediately confirms cache access without restating content\n2. Directs straight to implementation of Module 1\n3. References the service account location\n4. Includes your consent token for authentication\n5. Keeps token usage minimal\n\nWhen Claude DC confirms access to the cache, he should briefly outline the key headers/components from the cached instructions (which would be a good verification without extensive token usage). Then he can proceed directly to implementation.\n\nFor subsequent modules, you could use even more minimal prompts like:\n```\nModule 1 implementation complete. Please proceed with Module 2: Transparent Dashboard Skeleton.\n```\n\nThis approach leverages the persistence of the knowledge cache while minimizing the context window usage for each conversation."
