    " I've examined both files you've uploaded to Project Knowledge. Let me analyze each one:\n\n## 1. dashboard.py\n\nLooking at the dashboard.py file, I can see the issue causing the syntax error. At line 711-717, there's an issue with the `startup_event` function:\n\n```python\n@app.on_event(\"startup\")\nasync def startup_event():\n    \"\"\"Start background tasks when the server starts.\"\"\"\n    asyncio.create_task(send_updates())\n```\n\nThe issue is that there's a problem with how the docstring is formatted. It looks like there might be some invisible control characters or line breaks causing the \"unterminated triple-quoted string\" error.\n\n**Fix**: Replace this entire function with a clean implementation:\n\n```python\n@app.on_event(\"startup\")\nasync def startup_event():\n    \"\"\"Start background tasks when the server starts.\"\"\"\n    asyncio.create_task(send_updates())\n```\n\nYou'll want to completely delete that function and retype it to ensure there are no hidden control characters.\n\n## 2. conductor_config.json\n\nThe error \"Invalid control character at: line 39 column 36 (char 1500)\" is indeed coming from this file. Looking at the JSON file, I found the issue around line 39:\n\n```json\n\"correction\": \"Autonomous_Within_Boundaries\",\n\"oversight\": \"Human_Significant_Deviations\"\n```\n\nThere appears to be an invalid control character or an incomplete JSON structure here. This section is closing the \"execution_checkpoint\" object, but the JSON structure is incomplete - there's a missing closing brace.\n\n**Fix**: Add the missing closing brace after the \"Human_Significant_Deviations\" value:\n\n```json\n\"correction\": \"Autonomous_Within_Boundaries\",\n\"oversight\": \"Human_Significant_Deviations\"\n}\n```\n\nAlso, I noticed that the file has other structural issues. The \"neo_moments\" object at line 44 doesn't properly close the previous object. \n\nTo completely fix the conductor_config.json file, I recommend running it through a JSON validator or using an editor with JSON formatting capabilities to identify and fix all structural issues.\n\nAfter making these fixes, you should be able to restart the system without the syntax errors. Then the pattern display functionality should work correctly if the edge processor is configured to extract and categorize patterns.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to provide a more comprehensive fix for the conductor_config.json file as well!"
