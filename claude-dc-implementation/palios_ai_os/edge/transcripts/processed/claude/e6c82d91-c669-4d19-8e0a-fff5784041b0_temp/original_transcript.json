    " Yes, you're right. Let's remove the `verification_system.md` file as well since it's been replaced by the more comprehensive `verification_process.md`:\n\n```bash\n# Remove both redundant verification documentation files - copy entire box\nrm docs/claude/verification_system.md docs/claude/verification_system_simplified.md\n```\n\nThis will ensure we have just one clear, authoritative document on the verification process, avoiding any confusion from having multiple overlapping files."
