    " Let's simplify our approach and focus on getting the service accessible within the organizational constraints.\n\nHere's a streamlined approach with just the essential steps:\n\n1. First, let's make sure your Cloud Run service is properly configured:\n\n```bash\n# Update Cloud Run service to allow internal access\ngcloud run services update palios-taey-service \\\n  --region=us-central1 \\\n  --ingress=all\n```\n\n2. Try to grant your user account access specifically:\n\n```bash\n# Grant yourself access to the Cloud Run service\ngcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-service \\\n  --region=us-central1 \\\n  --member=\"user:jesse@taey.ai\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/run.invoker\"\n```\n\n3. If you still can't access the service, we need to set up a private Cloud Run service with VPC access:\n\n```bash\n# Create a VPC connector if it doesn't exist\ngcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create palios-taey-connector \\\n  --region=us-central1 \\\n  --network=vpc-prod-shared \\\n  --range=10.8.0.0/28\n\n# Update the Cloud Run service to use the VPC connector\ngcloud run services update palios-taey-service \\\n  --region=us-central1 \\\n  --vpc-connector=palios-taey-connector\n```\n\n4. Access the service through the VPC:\n\n```bash\n# Get the service URL\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey-service --region=us-central1 --format='value(status.url)')\n\n# Access the service (you'll need to authenticate with your Google account)\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)\" $SERVICE_URL/health\n```\n\nThis approach should work within organizational constraints while providing you access to the service."
