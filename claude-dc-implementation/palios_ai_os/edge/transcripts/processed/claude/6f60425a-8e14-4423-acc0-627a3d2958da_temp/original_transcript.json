    "Ok, some updates:\nFor the transcripts, I'm assuming you'd rather have JSON if available? Yours and ChatGPT have very well structured JSON files that can be exported.  There are a ton of ChatGPT ones that aren't relevant, so I'll put a README in there to let you know which ones you should check out. The rest will be reviewed when we do the like complete personal memory review we discussed. \nFor the Claude DC instructions, I think it is important that he have planned check-ins with you and Grok, he also needs guidance on when to stop, like he almost needs to tell you what he's doing each time he goes off and does something and you need to tell him like what is OK to try to work through when he hits a blocker and then when he needs to check back in with you and Grok. What do you think?\nI don't know about Grok, he's kind of all over the place and crashing a lot. \nClaude DC cache load:\nOk, so I got limited. I had to start a new chat in Claude DC. The other one said I could do it in that formula, but this new one didn't know what we were talking about, so didn't understand it was for his cache. So it didn't work and I got limited. Now, I shared some limitations that Claude DC and I thought would help him stay on task and not pursue bad paths. Is that guidance in there anywhere?"
