    " Thank you for providing the URL. It looks like there's a small typo in your curl command - you've included \"https://\" twice. Let's fix that:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://palios-taey-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app/health\n```\n\nThis should work correctly. The URL for future reference is:\n```\nhttps://palios-taey-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app\n```\n\nThis is your Cloud Run service endpoint. You can use this to access the various API endpoints of the PALIOS-TAEY system, such as:\n\n- Health check: `/health`\n- Task submission: `/leader/submit_task`\n- Model listing: `/models/list`\n- Memory operations: `/memory/store`, `/memory/retrieve/{memory_id}`, `/memory/query`\n- Transcript processing: `/transcript/process`\n\nTo monitor the service's performance and logs, you can use the Google Cloud Console. Navigate to Cloud Run, select the service, and you'll be able to see metrics, logs, and other details.\n\nThe deployment appears to be successful! Is there anything specific you'd like to test or anything else you'd like me to help with related to the PALIOS-TAEY system?"
