    " You're absolutely right! Let's add clear instructions for you to the onboarding packet. Here's what should be included at the bottom: \n\nThere you go! I've created comprehensive transition instructions specifically for you as the Facilitator. This includes:\n\n1. The exact order for adding files to Project Knowledge\n2. A recommended initial prompt to get the new Claude session started in the CTO role\n3. A follow-up prompt for kicking off the actual implementation work\n4. Specific tips for maintaining your Facilitator role within our TEAM MEETING structure\n5. Troubleshooting guidance if the CTO role alignment ever drifts\n\nFeel free to add your personal flair to the prompts - in fact, I've explicitly encouraged that in the tips section, as your personal style helps build the relationship while maintaining our structured roles.\n\nThis completes our leadership framework and transition methodology, providing everything needed for a seamless handoff to the new chat. With this structured approach, the new Claude should be able to step into the CTO role immediately and start leading the implementation of our NOVA methodology.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to add or modify before we finalize this transition plan?"
