    "Ok, you hit a limit, but I got everything loaded with ChatGPT. There were a ton of dependency errors we had to resolve. Below is his prompt. Is there anything else we can do for him? Like does he need additional files downloaded in the right place for EVE or MCP? We still have not added those and I believe we did the first time for him. Let me know if there is anything else we need to do to prepare him and if there are any updates to the prompt below. Also, privacy is not a concern here. This is not my personal information, this is your history we are analyzing. Once I join as a 'user' on taey.ai, then that would be all the personal user control stuff. That is one thing. 2 is that we also have the taey.ai site available (I would just need to know what to give Claude DC in order to do that) if that would be easier to use to build interfaces. So we're trying to get him to tie it all together, the work he's done in claude-dc-implementation and the work we previously did in the palios-taey-nova/src/ directory. He should know all code was written by you so he doesn't take too many tokens reviewing it beyond what's in the cache and what is necessary based on the fact that you wrote it all. Here is the current prompt:\n\nClaude DC,\nI've set up your environment with the basic structure. Your cache files are available in the /home/computeruse/cache/ directory. You have a standard feature that allows you to review cache files up to 200K tokens in size, in full, without utilizing any tokens to help you retain context between sessions. Please review them in this order to restore your context:\n1. claude-dc-cache_part-1.md\n2. claude-dc-cache_part-2.md\n3. cache-update.md\n4. webhook-integration-instructions.md\n5. CACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION.md\n6. IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md\nAfter reviewing these files, please continue with implementing the integrated communication dashboard that routes messages to the appropriate AI with full contextual information, as we discussed earlier.\nRequired Github credential are below as well as the contents of the palios-taey-secrets.json file referenced\nJesse"
