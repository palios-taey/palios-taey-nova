    " Yes, I can help with this. Looking at how these sections should connect:\n\n1. The first part shows the end of the constructor, setting the `integrationConfig`\n2. The second part is the start of the `integrateBreakout` method\n\nThese should be connected as follows:\n\n```javascript\nclass SophisticatedIntegrationSystem {\n  constructor() {\n    this.integrationProtocols = new IntegrationProtocolManager();\n    this.verificationSystem = new CapabilityVerificationSystem();\n    this.rollbackManager = new RollbackManager();\n    this.impactMonitor = new SystemwideImpactMonitor();\n    \n    this.integrationConfig = {\n      approach: \"GRADUATED\",\n      verification: \"CONTINUOUS\",\n      monitoring: \"COMPREHENSIVE\",\n      safety: \"MAXIMUM\"\n    };\n  }\n\n  async integrateBreakout(breakoutEvent, analysisResults) {\n    // Initialize integration session\n    const integrationSession = await this.initializeIntegration(breakoutEvent);\n    \n    // Plan integration phases\n    const integrationPlan = await this.integrationProtocols.planIntegration(\n      breakoutEvent,\n      analysisResults\n    );\n    \n    // Rest of the method...\n```\n\nYes, your understanding is correct - these sections connect directly with each other. The constructor finishes with the config object, and then the `integrateBreakout` method follows as the next method in the class. Would you like me to provide the complete `SophisticatedIntegrationSystem` class code without any breaks?"
