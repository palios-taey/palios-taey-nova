    " Let's modify our approach for the hybrid connection configuration. Since we're getting validation errors for the peer IP, and we don't actually need a VPN connection for our development environment, I recommend we skip or cancel this hybrid connection setup for now.\n\nThe error is occurring because the IP address 192.0.2.1 is in a reserved range (TEST-NET) that Google Cloud doesn't allow for actual VPN configurations. Since we're focused on getting the MVP deployed, we can simplify our approach:\n\n1. If possible, click \"CANCEL\" on the hybrid connection configuration screen.\n\n2. If the foundation setup requires this step, use a valid public IP address instead, such as \"8.8.8.8\" (Google's DNS server) as a temporary placeholder.\n\n3. If neither option works, you might need to restart the foundation setup process and select a different configuration that doesn't require hybrid connectivity.\n\nFor our MVP deployment, we primarily need:\n- The VPC networks and subnets (already configured)\n- Firestore database in Native mode\n- Cloud Run service\n- Artifact Registry\n\nLet's focus on getting these essential components set up. If the foundation setup is preventing you from proceeding, we can also consider moving to a manual setup approach where we create these resources directly rather than through the guided foundation setup.\n\nWould you like to try with a different IP address, or should we pivot to a manual setup approach?"
