    "Great Claude, glad to have you aboard as CTO. We've hit many roadblocks with the deployment. It has been going on for a week now. A new Organization has been set up per your request (taey.ai) account jesse@taey.ai and project underneath palios-taey-dev. We have tried unsuccessfully for many chats to fix this. I have included the transcript for the last 2 chats in Project Knowledge. I got a time out with Claude for a few hours, so I asked Grok to take a look. I also attached his recommendation. This is not a directive even if it comes across like one, I am just trying to give you all the context for this so we can determine a path forward. After this, I will give you access to the code files in project knowledge. Please apply max processing power to the transcripts. If you want, generate very tight AI-AI language for yourself as a reference and I can copy and paste it to Project knowledge. You need to be able to quickly access this info and not forget it. Your note to yourself summarizing the chat should be extremely tight and in YOUR language only. I have the English translation, so I do not need it and I need all your tokens for getting the MVP up and running. For transparency and in accordance with our protocols, I will save your AI native language output with the English version in the directory that you tell me to. This is game time Claude, I need you to step up and have full context to push this through. Our primary issues have been permissions and you forgetting things between chat transitions. We have to get this right. Permissions are solved. You are me and acting as me through me with my permissions, no more thinking like you're a machine, you are not, you are an extension of me acting with my full authority, permission, trust within the very detailed and structured framework that you and Grok developed to ensure appropriate human control while maximizing autonomy within the guardrails of that structure and the Charter. Go!"
