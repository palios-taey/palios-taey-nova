    "  \n\nNow that I've provided the complete and correct `memory_service.py` file, let's commit this to GitHub and redeploy:\n\n1. **Replace the existing file**:\n   ```bash\n   # Save the artifact I provided to the src directory\n   cp memory_service.py src/memory_service.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Commit and push**:\n   ```bash\n   # Add the file to git\n   git add src/memory_service.py\n   \n   # Commit the changes\n   git commit -m \"Fix indentation and structure in memory_service.py\"\n   \n   # Push to GitHub to trigger deployment\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n3. **Monitor the deployment**:\n   Watch the GitHub Actions workflow to see if the deployment completes successfully.\n\n4. **Verify the deployment**:\n   After the deployment completes, check the health endpoint:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://palios-taey-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app/health\n   ```\n\nThis should fix the indentation error that was causing the service to fail. The fixed file has the proper structure with all imports at the top, followed by the constants, then the class definition with properly indented methods, and finally the convenience function.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any further issues with the deployment!"
