    "Sorry Claude, I stopped you because you kept going on the SAME file after making the enhancements. The objective of this session was not to go deeper into a single file and make enhancements. The goal is to successfully test and deploy ALL the files. I don't know what that looks like, perhaps your next round of enhancements you were starting are aligned with that, but if not, move to the next file so we can complete this deployment, learn from it, and beginning planning our next NOVA build together."
