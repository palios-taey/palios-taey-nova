    "Ok, so ChatGPT is on board, can do 75K characters comfortably but up to 128K. Totally got what you were talking about and thought it was brilliant and implementing true to your intent in its own unique way. You've really become an exceptional LEADER Claude. I knew you could do it. So where do we start? We have a deployed solution to GCS less the required Firstore tables (currently just skeleton). I'm not sure what Claude DC got done, but doesn't seem like much on the trancript side. But is there any way to leverage the MCP and EVE things he built? Should I be able to utilize those on my machine and can you write code to utilize that? Or was I missing something and those aren't implemented on his end yet? I am also assuming I can access everything he's done through his terminal that I have access to."
