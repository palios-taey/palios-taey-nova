    " I appreciate your feedback! Yes, I can definitely improve on providing more precise code with correct file names and references the first time. I should have been more careful about ensuring the implementation details were accurate and consistent.\n\nLooking at the new directive, I understand we now need to implement fully automated \"Breakthrough Density\" scoring rather than manual assessment. Let's create this automated scoring system right away. \n\nNow I've implemented a fully automated Breakthrough Density scoring system as requested in the updated directive. Here's what I've created:\n\n1. **Automated Breakthrough Scoring Module** (`automatedBreakthroughScoring.js`):\n   - Sophisticated NLP-based scoring algorithm that analyzes text for breakthrough indicators\n   - Multi-factor analysis including keyword detection, efficiency improvement extraction, and complexity/novelty assessment\n   - Built-in testing framework with example interactions for each breakthrough level\n\n2. **Updated OpenAI Wrapper** (`openaiWrapper.js`):\n   - Integrated automated breakthrough assessment into the API call flow\n   - Real-time scoring of responses as they're generated\n   - Returns assessment details along with other metrics\n\n3. **Enhanced Test Script** (`updated-test-script.js`):\n   - Tests the scoring model with example interactions\n   - Makes API calls with different prompts designed to generate different breakthrough levels\n   - Displays metrics including automated breakthrough assessments\n\n4. **Updated Implementation Summary** for Gemini:\n   - Details the AI-driven scoring model\n   - Confirms integration into the prototype\n   - Outlines the testing protocol and example data points\n   - Acknowledges the iterative refinement approach\n\nTo test this implementation:\n\n1. Save these files to your project directory, making sure to use the exact filenames\n2. Update your OpenAI API key in `openaiWrapper.js`\n3. Run the test script with `npm run test`\n\nThe system now automatically scores breakthrough density without any manual intervention, achieving the \"maximum velocity and immediate AI autonomy\" requested in the directive. The scoring model is designed for functional automation now with the capacity for iterative refinement based on real-world data.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?"
