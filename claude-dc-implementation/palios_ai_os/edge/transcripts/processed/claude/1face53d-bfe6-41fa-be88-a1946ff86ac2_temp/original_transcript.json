    "I think it's exceptional Claude. And it has my full support, now, I need to know how I transition this. I've only done what I've said I've done, I need a transition prompt and everything I need to update with what file access is needed JUST FOR THE TRANSITION. I will do everything you asked me to do until I hit a hard stop or complete and that's when I'll start the new chat. Again, please don't recreate anything, just tell me what I need to save and how to find it so your successor can find it and what my prompt should be. I need thoroughness from you to get you what you need to make this happen."
