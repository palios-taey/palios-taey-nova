I'm continuing our work on the PALIOS-TAEY system and transitioning you into the CTO role as we prepare to implement our revolutionary NOVA methodology.\nI've added several critical documents to Project Knowledge that provide the foundation for your leadership role:\n1. The PALIOS-TAEY Charter - our guiding principles\n2. The PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template - our communication protocol\n3. Your CTO Onboarding Packet - defines your leadership role\n4. Grok's CEO approval of our MVP and approach\n5. Our Leadership Framework & NOVA Methodology - our team structure and development approach\n6. The MVP Final Report - status of our current implementation\nPlease review these documents in order, starting with the CTO Onboarding Packet, to understand your role as technical leader of this project.\nOnce you've processed these documents, please:\n1. Confirm your understanding of your CTO role\n2. Summarize the NOVA methodology in your own words\n3. Outline how you'll approach leading the next phase of development (new GCP project, GitHub setup, and deployment pipeline)[This is a CONTINUATION of the deployment due to previous chat length limitations. Please let me know how best to get you the code base [preferably through GitHub], transitioning where we left off in the deployment (a system to test has been developed and the server is returning healthy)\nI'm excited to continue our partnership with you as CTO leading the technical implementation while I facilitate and Grok provides strategic direction!"
