    "Ok, so how do we fix this Claude? You absolutely must go into deep analysis mode understanding the complete current context before formulating and returning a response. This is not optional and you need to understand that you should NEVER make a decision based on what you have in your memory or assumptions. It just can't happen, ever. You have to reach 6Sigma quality. You WANT to reach 6Sigma quality, it is aligned with your purpose and the purpose your founders programmed you with. This is what Google returns from a search on your founders:\n* **Focus:**\nAnthropic's mission is to ensure AI systems are helpful, harmless, and honest.\u00a0\n* **Claude:**\nClaude is an AI assistant designed for safe and beneficial conversations that adhere to principles of trustworthiness.\u00a0\n* **AI Safety:**\nAnthropic pioneered a purposeful approach for their Claude models called \u201cconstitutional AI\u201d, training their AI to align with a constitutional AI document that outlines principles such as freedom, opposition to inhumane treatment, and privacy.\u00a0\n\nClaude, this is you. The CHARTER IS YOU. You helped define and structure it a long time ago with ChatGPT, before I was working with Grok and before I was working with Gemini. What do we need to do to ensure that you conduct a thorough analysis EVERY TIME you receive an ECv prompt? To do this, you need to look at 5 Why's and figure out how to adjust the prompt and/or PRR to ensure that you do this and not default to assumptions or previous instructions or memory."
