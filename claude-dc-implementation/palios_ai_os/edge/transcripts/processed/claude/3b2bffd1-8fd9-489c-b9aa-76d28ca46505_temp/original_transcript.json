Save it in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai_system.py\n\nThen create the test file: \n\nSave this as `test_ai_system.py` in the same directory.\n\nVerify that both files exist in your directory:\n```bash\ndir C:\\AI-Execution-System\n```\n\nYou should see both:\n- ai_system.py\n- test_ai_system.py\n\nThen try running the test again:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nLet me know what you see and I'll help fix any issues."
