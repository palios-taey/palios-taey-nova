    " I see the issue with the conductor_config.json file - it has a parsing error that's causing problems. Let's take a more direct approach to fix both issues.\n\n## Fix for conductor_config.json\n\nSince we identified the error is around line 42, column 15, let's take a surgical approach:\n\n1. Look at line 42 in the file:\n```json\n\"oversight\": \"Human_Significant_Deviations\"\n```\n\n2. This line should be followed by a closing brace `}` but it appears to be missing. The issue is likely that this section needs to be properly closed before a new section begins.\n\n## Simpler Fix for dashboard.py\n\nSince we're still getting the error with the startup_event function despite trying to replace it, let's do a more surgical fix:\n\n1. Open dashboard.py with a simple text editor like nano:\n```\nnano dashboard.py\n```\n\n2. Find the problematic function (around line 711) and completely delete it:\n```python\n@app.on_event(\"startup\")\nasync def startup_event():\n    \"\"\"Start background tasks when the server starts.\"\"\"\n    asyncio.create_task(send_updates())\n```\n\n3. Rewrite it from scratch (type it manually):\n```python\n@app.on_event(\"startup\")\nasync def startup_event():\n    \"\"\"Start background tasks when the server starts.\"\"\"\n    asyncio.create_task(send_updates())\n```\n\n4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)\n\nThe key is to completely delete and rewrite the function rather than trying to modify it. This ensures there are no hidden control characters causing problems.\n\nFor the conductor_config.json file, the simplest approach might be to use a JSON validator website - copy the content, fix the errors (add missing closing braces), and then paste it back.\n\nLet me know if these more surgical approaches help resolve the issues!"
