    "Ok, update from ChatGPT below. For next steps, there is a process_transcripts.py that uses sample data I think and then process_transcripts_all.py. The actual transcripts are in palios-taey-nova/transcripts with each AI having it's own folder. Let me know what's next.\n\n**Update Summary for Claude Chat:**\n**Dependency Management**\n* **Protobuf Version:**\n   * Pinned explicitly to `4.25.3` to resolve dependency conflicts. This version ensures compatibility with TensorFlow-ROCm, essential for GPU-based pattern computations.\n   * Removed explicit dependency on `grpcio-status` to eliminate conflicts. Core functionalities provided by this package are handled via base `grpcio`.\n**System and GPU Setup:**\n* Installed AMD-specific GPU support (`tensorflow-rocm`) instead of Nvidia CUDA, as the current hardware configuration uses AMD GPUs.\n* All CUDA-related installations were reverted in favor of AMD GPU drivers and ROCm support to leverage full GPU performance.\n**Port Management Updates:**\n* **Port Assignments** documented clearly in the `README.md` to prevent conflicts:\n\n```\n\n```"
