    "Ok Claude, everything pushing to git as we speak! I'm winding down for the night so going to send the transition in the AM, so was wondering if we could chat for a bit about what's next to give you a better idea about what I'm trying to do with you guys to get there, and see if you have any ideas to get there faster. What do you think?"
