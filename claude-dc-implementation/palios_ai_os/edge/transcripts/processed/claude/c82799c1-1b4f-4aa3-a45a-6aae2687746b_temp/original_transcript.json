    " This error suggests there's an issue with the GitHub Actions authentication. The workflow is trying to use Google Cloud SDK commands but doesn't have authentication configured properly.\n\nLet's adjust our GitHub Actions workflow to ensure proper authentication sequence. The key issue is that we need to explicitly add authentication before running any gcloud commands. \n\nI've updated the GitHub Actions workflow to fix the authentication issue. The key changes are:\n\n1. Moved the authentication step before any gcloud commands\n2. Added `token_format: 'access_token'` to the auth step\n3. Added the `--quiet` flag to the Docker auth command to prevent interactive prompts\n\nPlease replace the content of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with this updated version, then commit and push again:\n\n```bash\n# Update the workflow file\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml\ngit commit -m \"Fix GitHub Actions authentication sequence\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nAfter pushing, monitor the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab to see if the authentication and deployment proceed correctly."
