    "Ok, you lost a lot from the artifact, I need you to take another look. The last Claude few Claud's included information about the required information you need to move forward (keys, Mac computer, cloud run info, GitHub info, etc.) Let's make sure to retain everything in the one you received that is meant to move forward and only update the current status, next steps, etc from this session and where we're at. Perhaps reorganizing so that the info that is supposed to change is at the top under the intro and the rest is indicated in some way to you that it is to be preserved between chats with clear instructions on how to use the file. I used to ask for it immediately, but I think now it makes sense to ask for it once I get my 'usage limit' warning. It is important (to me) for the integrity of this process and your CTO role, that handoffs be AI to AI. Open to suggestions, but if you agree, please update the tracker, if not, let me know why and we'll figure it out. This is really important to be clear to yourself in this because I'm having to burn tokens each time explaining. No need to apologize or anything, just something we need to work through due to the frequency of having to start new chats."
