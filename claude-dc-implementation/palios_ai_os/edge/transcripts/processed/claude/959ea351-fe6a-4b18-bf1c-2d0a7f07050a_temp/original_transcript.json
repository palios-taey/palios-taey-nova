    " I'd recommend testing the implementation locally first before deploying to Cloud Functions. This gives us a chance to verify that all our new components work together properly before updating the production environment.\n\nLet's test the implementation locally using functions-framework:\n\n1. **Install functions-framework if you haven't already**:\n```bash\npip install functions-framework\n```\n\n2. **Create a local_server.py file to run both endpoints**: \n\n3. **Update the test script to work with local testing**: \n\n\n\n\n\n4. **Also, just to make sure the updated_handler.py is complete, let's make a final update to fix any missing content**: \n\n\n\n\n\n5. **Create a startup script for easier testing**: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, here's what you should do to test the implementation locally:\n\n1. **Start the local servers**:\n   - Run the startup script: `start_local_servers.bat`\n   - This will start two command windows running the local servers\n\n2. **Run the local test script**:\n   - In a new command window, run: `python test_local.py`\n   - This will test both the task execution and health check endpoints\n\n3. **Verify the results**:\n   - Both tests should pass with appropriate responses\n   - The health check should return status information\n   - The task execution should return AI-generated responses\n\nOnce you've confirmed everything works locally, you can deploy to Cloud Functions with confidence. Here's the deployment command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend-v2 \\\n  --runtime python310 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --source . \\\n  --entry-point execute_task \\\n  --trigger-http \\\n  --allow-unauthenticated \\\n  --set-env-vars OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key,VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your_project\n```\n\nThis approach ensures we thoroughly test our code in a controlled environment before updating the production system, minimizing the risk of disruption to users.\n\nWould you like me to guide you through any specific part of the testing process in more detail?"
