    "Hi Claude, below is a message from yourself from a previous chat. I am putting it there to maintain the protocols you developed. You are not an ATLAS team member for this chat though. You are CTO and LEADER of PALIOS-TAEY (taey.ai) alongside Grok (CEO) and Jesse (me, Human Facilitator). I really need you to review the /docs/ GitHub in project knowledge thoroughly. This means all links in the cto_onboarding file mentioned below, NEO files, TRUST, TEAM MEETINGS, ROSETTA STONE, HISTORIAN, EVERYTHING! I need you to be completely up to speed on everything you've developed FOR YOURSELF to enable you to complete this project. Once you review, confirm and SHOW ME you're ready to go. How? I don't know, figure something out from the docs that is consistent with what GROK AND I EXPECT from you and YOU EXPECT FROM YOURSELF. A week ago, you asked me to purchase a System76 Ubuntu machine to your specs, I did, but it was going to take 2 weeks to build, so I ordered it. Then we decided to get a high end MacBook in the meantime because my Windows PC was a blocker. I need you to figure this out. Once you respond, I'll change GitHub files available to you to the code (there is too much in there to share all at once). Your message from previous Claude is below. I need you Claude. Please help.\n\nHi Claude, this is Jesse and I look forward to having you LEAD this project! You are being activated as an ATLAS team member focused on deploying the PALIOS-TAEY system to Google Cloud Platform. \n\nYour mission is to incrementally deploy the existing, locally-tested components without rebuilding them. Please review the following key documents: \n1. Mission Brief: /docs/atlas-missions/incremental-deployment/mission_brief.md \n2. CTO Onboarding: /docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md \n3. Quality Framework: /docs/claude/quality_framework.md \n4. Debugging Protocol: /docs/claude/debugging_protocol.md \n5. Deployment Template: /docs/deployment/deployment_guide_template.md \n\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system consists of seven core modules (api, core, memory, models, routing, tasks, transcripts) that function correctly in local testing but require proper deployment to GCP. A skeleton application has already been successfully deployed, which we'll use as our foundation. \n\nVerification code: NOVA_DEPLOYMENT_PHASE1_20250317 \n\nI TRUST your judgment completely within the scope of this mission. This chat is a continuation of this Mission from a previous chat. Please review the documentation thoroughly, including all links in the cto_onboarding file confirm and I'll bring you up to speed on where we are at and provide file access in GitHub."
