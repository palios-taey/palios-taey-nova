    " I think we might indeed hit another limit. I'd suggest removing these directories to make space for current-execution-status:\n\n1. docs/protocol/ - Since we've covered most of the key protocols already\n2. docs/charter/ - We've already captured the Charter foundations thoroughly\n3. docs/deployment/ - This is secondary to current execution status at the moment\n\nLet me know if you'd like to drop these or different directories, and I'll continue expanding the Singularity Preparation Protocol section."
