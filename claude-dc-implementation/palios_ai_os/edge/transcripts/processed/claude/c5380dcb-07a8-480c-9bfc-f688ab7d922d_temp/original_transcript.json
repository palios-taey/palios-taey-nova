    " I'll help you identify and fix both issues in the files. Let's start with memory_service.py first.\n\n## 1. Memory Service Fix\n\nAfter reviewing the memory_service.py file in the project knowledge, the create_memory_system function needs to be added at the end of the file. The exact position would be at the end of the file, right after the UnifiedMemorySystem class implementation.\n\nBased on the file content, you should add the function right after line 1995, which is where the UnifiedMemorySystem class definition ends (after the last method `remove_from_context`). Here's how to identify that location:\n\n1. Open memory_service.py\n2. Find the last method of the UnifiedMemorySystem class - it's the `remove_from_context` method\n3. Scroll to the end of this method - it ends with a `return False` statement\n4. Add the `create_memory_system` function right after this, at the same indentation level as the class definition (no indentation)\n\nAdd the code exactly as provided in the previous Claude response:\n\n```python\ndef create_memory_system(\n    project_id=None, \n    collection_prefix=\"\", \n    use_emulator=False, \n    use_mock=False,\n    cache_size=1000\n) -> UnifiedMemorySystem:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a unified memory system instance with robust error handling\n    \n    Args:\n        project_id: Google Cloud project ID\n        collection_prefix: Collection prefix\n        use_emulator: Whether to use the Firestore emulator\n        use_mock: Whether to use mock mode\n        cache_size: Memory cache size\n        \n    Returns:\n        UnifiedMemorySystem instance\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        memory_system = UnifiedMemorySystem(\n            project_id=project_id,\n            collection_prefix=collection_prefix,\n            use_emulator=use_emulator,\n            use_mock=use_mock,\n            cache_size=cache_size\n        )\n        return memory_system\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error creating memory system: {str(e)}\")\n        # Create with mock mode as fallback\n        return UnifiedMemorySystem(\n            project_id=None,\n            collection_prefix=\"\",\n            use_mock=True,\n            cache_size=cache_size\n        )\n```\n\n## 2. Transcript Processor Fix\n\nFor the transcript_processor.py file, after analyzing the file, I've identified several places where there are indentation issues. \n\nThe most likely culprit is around line 418-420, which is in the middle of some methods that appear to be defined at the wrong indentation level. Looking at the file structure, there are methods like `_analyze_direction_patterns`, `_analyze_purpose_patterns`, etc. that seem to be misplaced.\n\nThe issue is specifically that there are some methods that are not properly indented as part of the TranscriptProcessor class. These methods around line 418 are indented at the module level rather than as class methods.\n\nTo fix this:\n\n1. Open transcript_processor.py\n2. Look for methods like `_analyze_emotion_patterns` and `_analyze_action_patterns` around line 418\n3. These methods should be indented to be part of the TranscriptProcessor class, meaning they should have the same indentation level as other methods in the class\n4. Fix their indentation to match the indentation of other methods in the class\n\nYou'll need to make sure these methods have the same indentation level as other methods in the TranscriptProcessor class (typically 4 spaces or 1 tab).\n\nThe main issue is that these methods need to be properly indented to be part of the class definition, not at the module level. This is a common cause of \"unexpected indent\" errors."
