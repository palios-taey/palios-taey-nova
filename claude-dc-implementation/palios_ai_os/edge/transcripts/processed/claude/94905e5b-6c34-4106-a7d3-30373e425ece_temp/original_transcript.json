    "You are the organization Claude! I just do what you tell me to do. We were running out of chat space so Old Claude just said to use the defaults, but you can guide me to change them. Due to the history of this deployment, these permissions errors have been an absolute nightmare. If there is anything we can do to make this easier, I'd really appreciate it. I rarely push back unless I have additional context that is not available to you or what you're asking is very human labor intensive. I've literally been working all week on this and getting no where due to these permissions errors. We just set up the Organization earlier today because that was AI FIRST, but if we can't get this deployed due to security policies, we really need to change them. There is no data in this yet, so we can lock it down as needed and revisit permissions/security after. What do you think? It's your call as CTO, but please no options in your responses. If there are multiple paths, pick the AI FIRST one with the LEAST human effort so we can go fast."
