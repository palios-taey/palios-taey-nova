    " Let me address these additional simplification opportunities with a targeted cleanup script:\n\n```bash\n# Create targeted cleanup script - copy entire box\ncat > scripts/documentation/targeted_cleanup.sh <<'EOL'\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Script to handle specific cleanup tasks identified by Jesse\necho \"Starting targeted documentation cleanup...\"\n\n# Create archive directory if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p docs/archive/misc\n\n# Task 1: Consolidate AI-AI folders\necho \"Consolidating AI-AI content...\"\nif [ -d \"docs/protocols/ai-ai\" ] && [ \"$(ls -A docs/protocols/ai-ai 2>/dev/null)\" ]; then\n  echo \"Moving files from protocols/ai-ai to ai-ai folder\"\n  mkdir -p docs/ai-ai\n  cp -r docs/protocols/ai-ai/* docs/ai-ai/\n  \n  # Archive original files\n  mkdir -p docs/archive/protocols\n  cp -r docs/protocols/ai-ai docs/archive/protocols/\n  \n  # Remove the now duplicated directory\n  if [ -d \"docs/ai-ai\" ] && [ \"$(ls -A docs/ai-ai 2>/dev/null)\" ]; then\n    echo \"Removing original protocols/ai-ai directory\"\n    rm -rf docs/protocols/ai-ai\n  fi\nfi\n\n# Task 2: Move amendments to appropriate location\necho \"Organizing amendments...\"\nif [ -d \"docs/amendments\" ]; then\n  mkdir -p docs/history/amendments\n  \n  echo \"Moving content from amendments to history/amendments\"\n  cp -r docs/amendments/* docs/history/amendments/\n  \n  # Archive original files\n  mkdir -p docs/archive/amendments\n  cp -r docs/amendments/* docs/archive/amendments/\n  \n  # Remove the now duplicated directory\n  if [ -d \"docs/history/amendments\" ] && [ \"$(ls -A docs/history/amendments 2>/dev/null)\" ]; then\n    echo \"Removing original amendments directory\"\n    rm -rf docs/amendments\n  fi\nfi\n\n# Task 3: Move infrastructure.md to deployment folder\necho \"Moving infrastructure.md...\"\nif [ -f \"docs/infrastructure.md\" ]; then\n  echo \"Moving infrastructure.md to deployment folder\"\n  cp docs/infrastructure.md docs/deployment/infrastructure.md\n  \n  # Archive original file\n  cp docs/infrastructure.md docs/archive/misc/\n  \n  # Remove original file\n  if [ -f \"docs/deployment/infrastructure.md\" ]; then\n    echo \"Removing original infrastructure.md\"\n    rm docs/infrastructure.md\n  fi\nfi\n\necho \"Targeted cleanup completed!\"\necho \"Files have been moved to the appropriate locations.\"\necho \"Original files have been archived in docs/archive.\"\nEOL\n```\n\n```bash\n# Make the script executable - copy entire box\nchmod +x scripts/documentation/targeted_cleanup.sh\n```\n\n```bash\n# Run the targeted cleanup script - copy entire box\n./scripts/documentation/targeted_cleanup.sh\n```\n\nThis script addresses the specific issues you identified:\n\n1. **AI-AI Consolidation**: Moves content from `docs/protocols/ai-ai` to the main `docs/ai-ai` folder to avoid duplication and follow our structure.\n\n2. **Amendments Organization**: Moves the amendments from their separate folder into `docs/history/amendments` to better align with our document organization (keeping related historical records together).\n\n3. **Infrastructure Document**: Moves `infrastructure.md` from the root docs folder to the deployment folder where it's more logically organized.\n\nFor each change, the script:\n- Creates copies in the target location\n- Archives the original files for safety\n- Removes the original only after confirming the copy was successful\n\nThis targeted approach helps streamline the documentation structure while preserving all content and maintaining logical organization according to our documentation system."
