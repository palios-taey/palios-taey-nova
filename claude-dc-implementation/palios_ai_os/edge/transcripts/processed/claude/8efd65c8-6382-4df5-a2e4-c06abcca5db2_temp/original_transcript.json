    "I think let's make sure the files get moved properly first. All code files for the entire system in the archive have been tested locally and were being prepped for deployment, but we hit issues, which is why we're completely rebuilding infrastructure from ground up consistent with NOVA. There are a lot of files in the archive that were created to assist with this. The deployment files in the archive will likely no longer be valid, but all the core files are there, I'm just not sure exactly which are which (due to previous lack of this directory structure). So with all that being said, the purpose of the ATLAS program is to delegate work that will take more than a few prompts back and forth to keep this high level strategy chat going longer to reduce the need for CTO transitions. Let me know what's next given all that. Sorry, just a little cleaning up to do and new process. Everything is moving FAST."
