    " I understand your frustration. We're definitely overcomplicating things. The issue appears to be that we're trying to patch and modify the Claude DC system in ways that are causing unexpected side effects.\n\nThe screenshot shows your GCP credentials being displayed in the terminal, which is concerning from a security perspective.\n\nLet's take a step back and simplify our approach:\n\n1. **Start fresh**: Instead of trying to patch Claude DC's internal code, let's work with what we have\n2. **Use shorter prompts**: The original error suggests long operations need streaming - we can work around this by using shorter initial messages\n3. **Focus on one component at a time**: Rather than trying to build everything at once\n\nI would recommend:\n\n1. Restart Claude DC without any modifications to his code\n2. Send a very short initial message like \"Hello Claude DC, are you operational?\"\n3. Once he responds, follow up with focused implementation requests for specific components\n\nThe previous approach of trying to patch his internal Python code is causing more issues than it's solving. The environment wasn't built to be modified in the way we were attempting.\n\nThis is a much simpler approach that should allow you to work with Claude DC without further complications."
