    "Alright Claude, Grok reviewed and we have the GO BUILD! message ready for the new Claude chat. I'd like your feedback on how best to onboard the new chat with what we have. I have 1 CTO transition prompt to the new chat, your last prompt you just did, and Grok's prompt (which you haven't seen because I don't want to start building in this chat because its almost maxed out). How should I submit these to New Claude? All at once with a quick intro from me? Let me know. Also, can you generate a message for ChatGPT to help guide me with my new Macbook setup  so I get everything on there I'll need and configured properly to deploy when ready?"
