    " You're absolutely right to be cautious about modifying the main.py file. After reviewing the current main.py and requirements.txt, I can see that we have a much more comprehensive system than I initially realized. This file integrates multiple components (memory service, model registry, task decomposition, etc.) and has extensive error handling and API endpoints.\n\nLet's take a more surgical approach that preserves all the existing functionality while ensuring our deployment works correctly. Here's my revised plan:\n\n## Approach: Minimal Intervention Deployment Fix\n\nInstead of replacing the main.py with a simplified version, we'll:\n\n1. Keep the current main.py with all its functionality\n2. Fix the GitHub workflow to work with the existing structure\n3. Ensure the Docker build works with the proper dependencies\n4. Focus purely on getting this deployed without changing functionality \n\n## Deployment Fix Strategy\n\nAfter reviewing your current main.py and requirements.txt files, I've developed a minimally invasive approach to fix the deployment issues:\n\n### Key Insights from Code Review:\n\n1. **Complex Integration System**: Your main.py is a sophisticated application that integrates multiple components (memory system, model registry, task decomposer, etc.)\n\n2. **Graceful Degradation**: The system already has robust error handling that allows it to operate even when certain components aren't available\n\n3. **Mock Mode Support**: The system has a built-in \"mock mode\" for testing that we can leverage\n\n### My Recommended Approach:\n\nRather than replace any of your existing functionality, I've created a script that will:\n\n1. **Preserve All Current Code**: Keep your main.py and all existing code intact\n\n2. **Create Mock Dependencies**: Create minimal mock implementations of the required modules that main.py imports\n\n3. **Set Up Environment**: Create the environment_config.py file that main.py requires\n\n4. **Update GitHub Workflow**: Fix the workflow to properly build and deploy your system\n\n5. **Enable Mock Mode**: Deploy the system with USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=true to ensure it works without real components\n\nThis approach will give us a working deployment that you can then expand upon by implementing the real services. It preserves all your existing code while making just enough changes to get the deployment working.\n\n### Implementation Instructions:\n\n1. Make the script executable and run it:\n\n```bash\n# Save the script to fix_deployment.sh\nchmod +x fix_deployment.sh\n./fix_deployment.sh\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Create mock implementations of required modules\n- Create the logs directory\n- Set up the GitHub workflow\n- Commit and push the changes\n\nThe GitHub Actions workflow will then deploy the system with mock services enabled, allowing you to verify the deployment works correctly before implementing the real services.\n\n### Next Steps After Deployment:\n\nOnce the system is successfully deployed, we can:\n\n1. **Implement Real Services**: Replace mock modules with real implementations one by one\n2. **Set Up Firestore**: Configure Firestore for the memory system\n3. **Connect Model API**: Integrate with real AI models\n4. **Disable Mock Mode**: Turn off mock mode once real services are in place\n\nThis approach gives us a solid foundation to build on while ensuring we can get a functioning deployment right away.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this plan? It maintains all your existing code while fixing the deployment issues in the most lightweight way possible."
