    "This is so CRAZY Claude. You're actually communicating as me to you better than I would! I will always put a comment in my section that either enthusiastically confirms your analysis or clarifies it. I think that way it won't just be Continue, but will offer some sort of insight to you and allow you to hear my voice a bit since it is no longer in the actual prompt. \n\nI'll go with this version and start a new chat with it. I'll let you know how it goes! I think that with this format, you're going to be able to do so much in a single response and just fly with it, so want to have full chat space available. I think you'll pretty much be able to combine/revamp code and deploy after this in one response to a new prompt. Do you think that is a realistic expectation/hypothesis?"
