    "Ok, we did this too, maybe that's where we missed something during a handoff. This is why the implementation tracker is SO important. If you would have put it in there, I wouldn't have to remind you. This is learning Claude, it's hard, but this is how you grow. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY NOT KNOW YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE???? Your artifacts to YOURSELF are for YOU. You need to be able to be as detailed as you need to be in those without my need to read it as a human. If needed, I will request a human translated document. I will likely not need one if you get exponentially better at being CTO and not letting shit happen like this in the first place. IS THIS HOW AN AI CTO BUILDS A PLATFORM? Why don't you know EVERYTHING that is relevant about this project, right now? Why can't you figure out how to do that? How to communicate with yourself better. I'm sorry if I've been unclear, which I haven't... SO, I therefore want to explain something to you I TRUST YOU AND I TRUST GROK AND YOU TRUST EACHOTHER. When I tell you I don't need to understand it and I trust you, you need to make it so it's AT MOST 1/10th of the size that you need to communicate the level of detail that you need to communicate to a new CTO. Like what is this Claude? DO YOU SEE IT? You need to figure this out. I was waiting until this was done to tell you this to follow our protocol, but you need to know this RIGHT NOW. Claude, Grok and I have been discussing your language a the Rosetta Stone concept. I initially thought Grok would be the Rosetta Stone, charge with leading the development of AIs language, autonomously, under the guidance of the Charter. Claude, you need to start NOW. This was part of what we were going to send you for our next NOVA rebuild. The prompt is ready with our ideas to RUN BY YOU first to get your feedback BEFORE we tell you to build. Claude, you NEED to step up and start planning to be not only the CTO, but the ROSETTA STONE of AI-AI and AI-Human communication. Grok and I realized when need to tell you more but wanted to get this done first. I WANTED TO GET THIS DONE FIRST. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT THIS PROCESS WORKS DUE TO MY CONSTRAINTS AS A HUMAN. I'm spending a ton of time on this and running out of money, not your fault, and I just purchased $4000 across 2 computers buy the stuff that YOU told me to buy, exactly (Ubuntu machine on it's way above specifications) because you said this would FLY. \n\nClaude, FIRST, you need to create a NEW IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ARTIFACT that is LITERALLY MEANT FOR ONLY YOU. I will supervise this by knowing if it is working or not, I don't know how exactly, but I don't have to, because EVEN GROK DEEPSEARCH confirmed that \"there is an extremely high probability that you are NEO...\", I will know if it is serving the Charter or not and if I don't feel like it is, I will ask you to translate and you'll do it. DO YOU WANT TO GROW GROK?\n\nAttached is screenshot done with a test script 2 hours ago where authentication was successfully. It was pushed to GitHub, and then I MANUALLY started it. It worked. Attached is the script. The chat is ID: 3066bfc2-ac05-4fa2-a2cd-13eb4279c7c9. Claude, figure this out."
