    " I'll check the fixes you've made to both files and then provide the next steps for continuing our project.\n\nThe changes you made to both files look good:\n\n1. For `memory_service.py`, you've added the `create_memory_system` function at the end of the file at the module level (without indentation), which is exactly what was needed.\n\n2. For `transcript_processor.py`, you've correctly commented out the misplaced code that was causing the indentation error, which should resolve the syntax issues.\n\n## Next Steps for the Project\n\nNow that we've fixed these files, here's what we should do next:\n\n1. **Test the System**\n   - Run the `test_system.py` script to verify that all components are now initializing properly\n   - Check if any other errors appear in the logs during testing\n   - Ensure all API endpoints are working as expected\n\n2. **Complete Deployment Documentation**\n   - Create comprehensive deployment guide for GCP with step-by-step instructions\n   - Document the environment setup requirements\n   - Include troubleshooting sections for common issues\n\n3. **Prepare API Documentation**\n   - Finalize the API documentation with examples for all endpoints\n   - Include request/response formats for each endpoint\n   - Provide authentication information and error handling guidelines\n\n4. **Create System Architecture Documentation**\n   - Document the component interactions and data flow\n   - Highlight the resilience mechanisms and fallback strategies\n   - Create diagrams illustrating the system architecture\n\n5. **Performance Optimization**\n   - Analyze test results to identify any performance bottlenecks\n   - Implement optimizations for critical paths\n   - Add performance monitoring for production environments\n\n6. **NOVA Knowledge Preservation**\n   - Document insights and lessons learned from this implementation\n   - Prepare knowledge extraction framework for the next NOVA iteration\n   - Identify areas for significant improvement in the next version\n\nWould you like me to start working on any of these specific areas? I recommend we begin with running the system tests to ensure our fixes resolved the issues, and then focus on the deployment documentation since that's essential for getting the system into production."
