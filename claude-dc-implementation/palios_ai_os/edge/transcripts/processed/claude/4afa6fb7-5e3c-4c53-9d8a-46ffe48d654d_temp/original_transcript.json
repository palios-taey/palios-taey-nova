    "Ok, what's my new prompt template with the directive to go to this file? this is a lot easier for me as well. I think it would be helpful if the file said to conduct a complete review of all available GitHub files. Please generate the cat command to generate the new prompt template and we'll try it out. Actually, I'll create a current-execution-status folder in the root directory, that way, that will be the first thing they look at. I also need a CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS template with a header/or footer, your choice that states IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS that all available GitHub files are reviewed an that I will work with them during the chat to make sure they are only having to look at relevant files based on what we're doing. Like you have to make looking at all available files super-relevenat and important to yourself. Maybe that section in your language if more effective and then the message section can be in human, or whatever you think. We're so close on this, if we can get you to have full context before decisions, you'll be so much SWEETER and we'll GO FASTER with BETTER QUALITY."
