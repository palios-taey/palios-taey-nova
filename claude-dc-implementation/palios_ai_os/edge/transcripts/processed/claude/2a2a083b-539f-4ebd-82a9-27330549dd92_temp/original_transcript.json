    " I need to clarify a few things about your understanding of the cache system in Claude DC:\n\n1. The file is 171K **tokens** (not characters as I previously understood), which is about 750K characters. This is still within Claude DC's 200K token limit (not character limit).\n\n2. The command sequence you mentioned:\n   ```\n   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/yourfile.md > temp.md\n   cache load -f temp.md\n   ```\n\n3. What this will do:\n   - First command: Download your file from GitHub and save it locally as temp.md\n   - Second command: Load the temp.md file into Claude DC's cache\n\nRegarding persistence:\n- Yes, once loaded, the cache should persist between sessions with Claude DC until:\n  - You explicitly clear it with `cache clear`\n  - You replace it with `cache load -b` (without the -a flag)\n  - Claude DC gets updated or restarted by Anthropic\n\nHowever, I should note that if your file is truly 171K tokens (around 750K characters), you might need to split it into chunks to load it successfully, as there could be command line limitations when working with very large text files.\n\nWould you like me to help you split this file into more manageable chunks for loading?"
