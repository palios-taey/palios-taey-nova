    " I should clarify - you're meant to implement these steps first, and then we would report back to CTO Claude with the completed work. The steps I provided are the practical implementation instructions for you to execute.\n\nLet's proceed with the actual implementation of these steps:\n\n1. First, let's create the placeholder directories and __init__.py files for the remaining components\n2. Then create the README files for each component\n3. Create the documentation files for file deduplication and GitHub connection\n4. Commit and push everything to GitHub\n\nWould you like me to break down the next actions into smaller steps? Or would you prefer to start with a specific part of the implementation?"
