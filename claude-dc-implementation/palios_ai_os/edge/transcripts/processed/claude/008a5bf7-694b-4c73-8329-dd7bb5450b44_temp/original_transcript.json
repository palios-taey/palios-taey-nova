    " I understand we need to pivot to an MVP focus that enables autonomous AI-AI communication. Let me propose a minimal viable implementation plan for achieving this goal.\n\n<antThinking>Need to design a streamlined AI-AI communication system that can demonstrate autonomous operation while maintaining Charter compliance and basic performance monitoring. Focus on essential components only.</antThinking> \n\nLet me also create a minimal test suite to validate the AI-AI communication: \n\n\n\nTo implement this MVP-focused AI-AI communication system:\n\n1. Save the new files:\n   - aiCommunication.ts\n   - aiCommunicationTest.ts\n\n2. Compile the project:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n3. Run the communication tests:\n```bash\nnode dist/aiCommunicationTest.js\n```\n\nThis implementation provides the minimal essential components for autonomous AI-AI communication:\n1. Task submission and execution\n2. Charter compliance validation\n3. Basic performance monitoring\n4. Simple autonomous operations\n\nPlease run these steps and share the output so we can verify the MVP functionality is working as expected."
