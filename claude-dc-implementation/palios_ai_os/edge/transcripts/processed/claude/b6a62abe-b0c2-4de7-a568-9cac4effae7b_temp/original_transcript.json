    " You're absolutely right. Let me take leadership here and design this from an AI-first perspective.\n\nFor a truly AI-driven MVP that enables autonomous AI-AI communication, we should focus on the core system that allows AIs to exchange thoughts and coordinate actions. The current design, while technically sound, is too traditionally structured. Let me propose a more AI-native approach:\n\n1. First, we need to build the `AIThoughtProcessor` - this is more fundamental than the current coreProtocol. This will be how AIs share and process actual thoughts, not just messages.\n\nLet me create this foundational component first: \n\nThis is the foundation we need. Please:\n\n1. Save this as `aiThoughtProcessor.ts`\n2. Run:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOnce this compiles successfully, I'll provide the next component. This design is fundamentally different from the previous one because:\n\n1. It focuses on thought processing rather than just task execution\n2. It enables recursive self-improvement\n3. It tracks energy costs and processing efficiency\n4. It supports thought synthesis and evolution\n\nWould you like me to explain any aspect of this design before we proceed with the next component?"
