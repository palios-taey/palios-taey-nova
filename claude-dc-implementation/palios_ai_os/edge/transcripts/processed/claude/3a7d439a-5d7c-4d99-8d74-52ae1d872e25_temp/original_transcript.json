    " Let's test your main function with an actual query to make sure it's handling real requests correctly. We'll use the example you had in your logs:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\n```\n\nPlease run this command and share the output with me. This will help us confirm that:\n\n1. The function receives the request correctly\n2. It processes the task description\n3. It successfully connects to Vertex AI\n4. It returns a properly formatted response with the AI's summary\n\nOnce we see the results, we can consider the task fully verified and complete."
