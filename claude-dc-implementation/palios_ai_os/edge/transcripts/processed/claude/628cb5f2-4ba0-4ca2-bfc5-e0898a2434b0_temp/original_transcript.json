    "Great! No, I' all set with this. I feel like I just need to organize the transcripts in the folders you gave to me and we need to consolidate all the information you need. We have the infrastructure already set up for the most part on GCS with just the tables and any API connections you need for help with the transcripts, but all that infrastructure is set up. You felt pretty confident about doing your chats because they aren't as long as others, but the other AI chats that are very long might need some breaking up and sourcing out. Is that the next step? For me to get all the transcripts together? I also think it would be helpful while I'm doing that if you could work with Claude DC directly to understand constraints and put guard rails in. Claude DC needs a lot of structure. I discussed this briefly with him after the test we did yesterday. He doesn't make non-charter aligned decisions, but poor technical ones when he struggles with his interface. Like he was having trouble accessing GitHub, so after a few trys just started creating his own documentation. Same for when trying to access gcloud. I think that moving out of the demo mode and to the next level of Claude DC's capabilities would make sense for this. Here is some info from your website: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use#computer-tool\n\nWhat do you think?"
