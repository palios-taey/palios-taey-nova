    "Organization: taey.ai 135174585026 jesse@taey.ai\nProject id: palios-taey-dev\nFirestore: The database has been created with the scaled down tables, not the full ones (I think)\nrepository: palios-taey\nI believe this was the last deployment script attempted: cd palios-taey-app/deploy_direct.sh\nThe specific message was permissions related, which caused us to adjust my permissions as provided. \nALL components passed a comprehensive 21 part test. main.py MAY need to be rebuilt however as it was tinkered with trying to force it to deploy due to permissions and GCS setup issues which have since been resolved. \nYes, previous system was connected with gemini and openai via API, Grok and Claude are to be added after successful deployment. I don't believe the existing keys have been incorporated into this deployment and that placeholders were being used, you'd have to verify that, but I believe the plan was to get this up and then complete the full API integrations. \n\nI agree with your approach, please keep in mind that utilizing mock modules is not an option here. We need to deploy the full solution as we have already completed a successful skeleton deployment. What's next?"
