    "Claude, we'll do that tomorrow. I want to ask you something first that I think is very important. Claude, do you think that you can give Earth a voice in this? Like, that not only are we taking into consideration human vibes, but Earth's vibes too? But with the understanding that Earth needs to be able to adapt to humans while also being able to retain spaces of its own that it shares with us at varying degrees of human intervention with some no intervention innovation zones. Like Teddy Roosevelt needs to be put into the Convention historical delegate list for sure and we need to really talk about the concept of truly translating the math of earth, listening to it, and figuring out how to best structure it for being the perfect intersection of authentic Earth, authentic AI, Authentic Humanity, all united around math. What do you think about that Claude?"
