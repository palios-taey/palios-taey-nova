    " The `execute_task` function accesses your OpenAI API key through these key steps:\n\n1. It creates a new Firestore client connection specifically within the function:\n   ```python\n   db = firestore.Client(project='ai-execution-system')\n   ```\n\n2. It accesses a collection in Firestore called \"keys\":\n   ```python\n   keys_ref = db.collection('keys')\n   ```\n\n3. It streams the documents from this collection and retrieves the first one:\n   ```python\n   docs = keys_ref.stream()\n   for doc in docs:\n       keys = doc.to_dict()\n       openai_key = keys.get('OpenAI')\n       break\n   ```\n\nThis approach was derived from your existing code in the `setup_api_keys` method of the `AISystem` class. It's looking for a document in your Firestore database that contains an \"OpenAI\" field with your API key.\n\nBased on your original implementation, it appears your system stores API keys in Firestore rather than as environment variables or other configuration settings. This approach keeps the API key in your database rather than hardcoding it in the function code."
