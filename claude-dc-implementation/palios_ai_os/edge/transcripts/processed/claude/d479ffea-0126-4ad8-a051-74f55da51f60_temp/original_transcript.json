    "Ok, let's think through this thoroughly. I need to have the repository up to date with everything he needs before we connect it so we don't have merge issues. I need to save the setup script somewhere in the palios-taey-nova repository. It will probably need to be revised to not include github and complete the full setup we want with requirements.txt from claude-dc-implementation/\n\nAm I thinking about this correctly? Get everything needed into github, including set up script, configure github repository, run the setup script, do the prompt telling him to access the cache and not use tokens."
