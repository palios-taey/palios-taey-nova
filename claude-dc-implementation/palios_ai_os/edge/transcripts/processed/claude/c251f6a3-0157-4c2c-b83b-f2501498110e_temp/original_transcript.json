    "  \n\nGreat job! Let's finalize this implementation and push it to GitHub.\n\nHere's what we need to do next:\n\n1. First, let's run the verification script to confirm everything is set up correctly:\n\n```bash\n# Make the verification script executable and run it - copy entire box\nchmod +x scripts/documentation/verify_setup.sh\n./scripts/documentation/verify_setup.sh\n```\n\n2. Next, let's generate an initial mapping file for future document reorganization:\n\n```bash\n# Generate the initial mapping file - copy entire box\nchmod +x scripts/documentation/generate_mapping.sh\n./scripts/documentation/generate_mapping.sh\n```\n\n3. Now, let's prepare for the GitHub push:\n\n```bash\n# Add all new files to git staging - copy entire box\ngit add docs/\ngit add scripts/documentation/\n```\n\n4. Commit the changes with our prepared message:\n\n```bash\n# Commit the changes with the prepared message - copy entire box\ngit commit -F commit_message.txt\n```\n\n5. Push the changes to GitHub:\n\n```bash\n# Push the changes to GitHub - copy entire box\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nEverything is complete! We've successfully implemented:\n\n1. The audience-aware documentation structure with specialized directories\n2. Templates for different document types (Claude-to-Claude, AI-AI, etc.)\n3. Automation scripts for document management\n4. A quality protocol with human error prevention guidelines\n5. An update to the quality protocol incorporating our formatting lessons \n\nYou don't need to delete anything - all the files we created are part of the complete documentation system. The scripts are designed to work together, with each serving a specific purpose in the documentation workflow.\n\nOnce you've pushed to GitHub, I'll be able to review the implementation and confirm everything is working as expected. This documentation restructuring provides a solid foundation for all future PALIOS-TAEY documentation, with a focus on quality, error prevention, and audience-appropriate formatting."
