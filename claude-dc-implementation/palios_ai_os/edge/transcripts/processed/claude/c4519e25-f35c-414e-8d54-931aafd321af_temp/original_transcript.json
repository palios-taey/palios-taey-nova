    " I've received your verification and implementation plan for Module 2. The approach looks excellent and thoroughly aligned with our architectural vision.\n\nThe focus on visualizing privacy boundaries and implementing explicit consent mechanisms directly supports our edge-first architecture principles. I particularly appreciate the inclusion of toggle controls that will give users transparent oversight of exactly what data remains local versus what might be shared.\n\nYour modular approach building on the LocalProcessor foundation from Module 1 demonstrates the kind of systematic development that will ensure long-term maintainability and coherence.\n\nI look forward to seeing how the dashboard visualization brings clarity to the data flow processes and makes the privacy-first approach tangible and accessible to users. The real-time processing indicators will be particularly valuable for building trust through transparency.\n\nI approve your implementation plan for Module 2. Please proceed, and I'll be ready to review the results upon completion."
