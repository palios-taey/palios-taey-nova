    " // ROSETTA_STONE_AI_INTERNAL_NOTES\n// Analyzing situation and current deployment status\n// - Permission issues with Terraform are expected based on previous attempts\n// - Hybrid approach is the correct strategy (manual setup + minimal automation)\n// - Current position is API setup and basic deployment using gcloud commands\n// - Objective is to establish a minimal working system in the cloud\n// - \"Step 4\" indicates we are at the \"Deploy application to Cloud Run\" stage\n//\n// Action planning:\n// 1. Acknowledge foundation work and configure detailed deployment steps\n// 2. Focus on concrete, executable commands to deploy the application to Cloud Run\n// 3. Ensure all prerequisites are verified before deployment\n// 4. Provide clear success criteria and validation steps\n// 5. Document the deployment for future reference\n//\n// Charter alignment considerations:\n// - Data-Driven Truth: Acknowledge permission constraints and work with actual conditions\n// - Continuous Learning: Apply lessons from previous attempts\n// - Resource Optimization: Focus on minimal viable infrastructure first\n// - Charter-Aligned Operations: Document all steps for transparency\n\nconsole.log(\"Analysis complete - proceeding with deployment instructions\");\n\nI understand we've successfully completed steps 1-3 of the deployment plan and are now ready for step 4: \"Deploy application to Cloud Run.\" Let's proceed with the deployment.\n\nSince you've confirmed that the APIs are enabled, the storage bucket exists, and Firestore has been created manually, we're in good shape to deploy the application. Here are the detailed deployment steps for the application:\n\n## Step 4: Deploy Application to Cloud Run\n\nLet's deploy the minimal application we created earlier to Cloud Run:\n\n```bash\n# Ensure you're in the application directory\ncd palios-taey-app\n\n# Build and push the container to Artifact Registry\ngcloud builds submit --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/palios-taey-dev/palios-taey/api:latest\n\n# Deploy to Cloud Run\ngcloud run deploy palios-taey-service \\\n  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/palios-taey-dev/palios-taey/api:latest \\\n  --platform managed \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --allow-unauthenticated \\\n  --memory 512Mi \\\n  --cpu 1 \\\n  --min-instances 1 \\\n  --max-instances 10 \\\n  --set-env-vars=\"PROJECT_ID=palios-taey-dev,ENVIRONMENT=dev\"\n```\n\n## Step 5: Verify Deployment\n\nOnce the deployment completes, let's verify that it's working correctly:\n\n```bash\n# Get the service URL\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey-service --format='value(status.url)')\n\n# Test the health endpoint\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/health\n\n# The expected output should be: {\"status\":\"healthy\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\"}\n```\n\n## Additional Configuration (Optional)\n\nIf you'd like to add a public policy to allow unauthenticated access (which we've already included in the deployment command), you can also do this:\n\n```bash\n# Create policy.yaml file if it doesn't exist already\ncat > policy.yaml <<EOL\nbindings:\n- members:\n  - allUsers\n  role: roles/run.invoker\nEOL\n\n# Apply the policy\ngcloud run services set-iam-policy palios-taey-service policy.yaml --region=us-central1\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues:\n\n1. **Build failures**: Check that the Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and main.py files exist and are correctly formatted\n2. **Deployment failures**: Verify that the Artifact Registry repository exists and the service account has appropriate permissions\n3. **Runtime errors**: Check Cloud Run logs for details on any runtime issues\n\nLet me know once the deployment is complete and we can verify the service is working correctly. Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?"
