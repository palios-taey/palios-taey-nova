    " Great! We've made significant progress. The server is now running and properly responding to health check requests. As expected, all components are marked as \"unavailable\" because we haven't set up the necessary configurations for them yet.\n\nThis is actually a good sign! In a NOVA methodology approach, we've successfully deployed the base system, and now we can iteratively improve it by adding the necessary configuration and implementation for each component.\n\nHere's our next step:\n\n## Implementing Component Initialization\n\nThe current issue is that our components aren't being properly initialized. To fix this without requiring a lot of manual configuration, we should enhance our initialization process to use mock data when the real configurations aren't available.\n\nHere's my proposal for the next steps:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration**:\n   Let's set up some environment variables in Cloud Run to configure the system:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcloud run services update palios-taey-core \\\n     --region=us-central1 \\\n     --set-env-vars=\"PROJECT_ID=ai-execution-system,COLLECTION_PREFIX=prod_,USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=true\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Create Firestore Collections**:\n   We should create initial Firestore collections to enable the memory system. However, since you may not have direct Firestore access, we can modify our code to automatically create these collections when they don't exist.\n\n3. **Mock Data Implementation**:\n   Let's add more robust mock data and fallback mechanisms to make the system work even without proper external configurations.\n\nGiven that the system is now properly responding to HTTP requests, we're ready to focus on making the actual components work. Would you like me to prepare the changes for this next phase?"
