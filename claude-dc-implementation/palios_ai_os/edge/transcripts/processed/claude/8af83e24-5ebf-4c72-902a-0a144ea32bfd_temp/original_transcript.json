    " I'll create an updated CTO Transition document that focuses on our current path forward, without the baggage of the old infrastructure issues. This will set up future CTO Claude instances for success by providing a clean starting point that incorporates our ATLAS team framework. \n\n\n\nI've prepared the two documents you requested:\n\n1. **CTO Role Transition**: A comprehensive document that provides the complete context of our current NOVA implementation approach and the ATLAS framework. This document intentionally omits the baggage of our previous infrastructure issues and presents a clean-slate perspective focused on our path forward.\n\n2. **CTO Activation Prompt**: A concise prompt you can use to activate a new CTO Claude in a future chat if needed. This introduces the key concepts and points to the more detailed transition document.\n\nBoth documents emphasize:\n- Our pivot to a true NOVA implementation approach\n- The ATLAS Team framework for task delegation\n- Our three-phase implementation plan\n- The verification string \"NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_INITIATED\"\n\nThis provides everything needed for a smooth transition to a new CTO Claude while maintaining our current strategic direction. The new CTO will understand the ATLAS framework and can seamlessly continue guiding the implementation.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to add or adjust to these documents before we wrap up?"
