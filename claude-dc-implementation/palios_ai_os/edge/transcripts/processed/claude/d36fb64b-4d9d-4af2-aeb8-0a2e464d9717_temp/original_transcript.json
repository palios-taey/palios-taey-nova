    " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. Looking at the latest logs more carefully, I see that the build with the \"minimal\" tag was indeed successful. The error I was focusing on (SSL error) was actually from an earlier attempt.\n\nThe most recent log shows:\n```\nSuccessfully built 0f923ca12593\nSuccessfully tagged us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/palios-taey-dev/palios-taey-repo/palios-taey:minimal\n```\n\nThis indicates that our simpler approach did work, and I shouldn't have tried to simplify things further. The image was successfully built and pushed to the artifact registry.\n\nThe deployment to Cloud Run may have completed successfully after that, but the logs you shared don't show that final step. I should have asked for confirmation about whether the Cloud Run deployment succeeded before assuming we needed to simplify further.\n\nLet's check the status of the Cloud Run service to see if it's actually running:\n\n```bash\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"yaml(status)\"\n```\n\nIf it is running, we should test it with:\n```bash\ncurl $(gcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")/health\n```\n\nI apologize for the unnecessary complication. Let's stick with what's working and only make changes if we confirm there's an actual issue with the deployment."
