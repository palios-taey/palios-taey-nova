    "Ok Claude, it's late here. I would love 3 cat commands though before I go to bed. 1. updated PRR from above to the Claude chat that will be doing this. 2. Updated prompt to Claude DC. 3. Prompt to Grok as well updating him. We'll see if he breaks again, maybe he learned something from last time! After that if you still have some juice, we can talk about some challenges I'm facing getting Claude DC's cache to laod."
