    "I have added the READ ME report from the last session with the 3 supporting artifacts in Project knowledge for you review. So I can best support you on this, please indicate what code files or additional artifacts you need from the old Claude chat to complete the work on the project and how best to get them to you (project knowledge, Google Drive, etc). Then, once I complete that and you confirm, I'll send the 'go build' prompt with some new guidance to complete the project."
