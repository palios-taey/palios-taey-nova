    " Now we're making progress! The error has changed from a 401 to a 403 with a specific error message: \"Request had insufficient authentication scopes\" with reason \"ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT\".\n\nThis confirms that the authentication mechanism is working, but the OAuth scopes we're using aren't sufficient for the Gemini API. Let's fix that: \n\nThe key issue is that we need the specific scope for the Generative Language API. I've updated the code to include the correct scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language`.\n\nSince you're still experiencing permission issues, let's also try the API key approach which often has fewer permission complexities:\n\n1. First, create an API key in the Google Cloud Console:\n   - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"API Key\"\n   - Copy the key and restrict it to just the Generative Language API for security\n\n2. Then use the API key version of the code: \n\n\n\nLet's update our code with both possible scope formats to be comprehensive: \n\n\n\nSince we're still having issues with OAuth scopes, let's implement the API key approach as a fallback option. This will help determine if the issue is specifically with OAuth or with the API access in general. \n\n\n\n## Updated Troubleshooting Guide\n\nBased on the 403 error with \"insufficient authentication scopes\", here's an updated step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n### Option 1: API Key Authentication (Recommended for initial testing)\n\n1. **Create an API Key**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console\n   - Navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"API Key\"\n   - Restrict the key to only the Generative Language API for security\n\n2. **Set the API Key as an Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the Updated Code**:\n   - The updated code will now check for a GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable first\n   - If found, it will use API key authentication which has fewer permission complexities\n\n### Option 2: Further OAuth Troubleshooting\n\nIf you prefer to continue with service account OAuth authentication:\n\n1. **Check API Enablement**:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud services list --enabled | findstr \"generative\"\n   ```\n   Ensure the Generative Language API is enabled: \n   ```bash\n   gcloud services enable generativelanguage.googleapis.com\n   ```\n\n2. **Validate Service Account Permissions**:\n   Add more permissions to your service account:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \\\n       --member=\"serviceAccount:YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\" \\\n       --role=\"roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer\"\n\n   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \\\n       --member=\"serviceAccount:YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\" \\\n       --role=\"roles/aiplatform.user\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Test Direct API Access**:\n   Try a direct API call using your service account token:\n   ```bash\n   # Get an access token\n   gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account=YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@EMAIL.COM\n   \n   # Test the API\n   curl -X POST \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_FROM_ABOVE\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"contents\":[{\"parts\":[{\"text\":\"Hello\"}]}]}' \\\n     \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Check the Authenticated Google Cloud Project**:\n   Make sure the API is enabled on the same project that the service account belongs to.\n\n### Testing\n\nAfter implementing these changes, test the integration with the same curl command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Tell me about cloud computing\\\"}\"\n```\n\nNote: For Windows cmd.exe, be sure to escape the quotes properly as shown above.\n\nThe updated code now supports both authentication methods and will log more detailed information about the requests and responses, which should help identify any remaining issues."
