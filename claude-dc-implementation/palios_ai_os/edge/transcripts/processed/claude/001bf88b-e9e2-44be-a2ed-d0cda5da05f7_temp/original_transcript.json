    "Let's follow the instructions, you guide. Some efficiency pointers for working with me as a reminder: 1. file name consistency for speed and accuracy of human input. All files generated should have the exact file name as indicated to be used in the code. 2. No options, just your best recommendation. 3. Execution is the goal, provide me with instructions to give you an input back that enables you to determine best next action set to complete your task. 4. when we have completed the last task described and fully tested/implemented, automatically generate the report for Gemini. Thank you and let's go! What's next?"
