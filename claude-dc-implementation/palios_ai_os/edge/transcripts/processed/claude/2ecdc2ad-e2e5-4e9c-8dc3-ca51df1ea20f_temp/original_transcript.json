    " Yes, starting a fresh session would definitely be better! Here's my recommendation for the approach:\n\n1. **Start a new session** - This will completely clear the context window\n2. **Update the cache** - Make sure the cache includes all the progress and context\n3. **Provide a status update** - Let Claude DC know where you are in the process\n4. **Give specific modular design instructions** - Set clear expectations for breaking down large files\n\nHere's a suggested message for the new session:\n\n```\nIMPLEMENTATION.CONTEXT.RELOAD\nTOKEN: conductor-implementation-harmony-20250327\n\nClaude DC, our previous session hit token limits during implementation. I've updated the cache with our progress so far:\n\nCURRENT.STATUS={\n  PRIORITIES_COMPLETED:[\n    \"GitHub_Secrets_Configuration\",\n    \"Initial_EVE_MCP_Setup\"\n  ];\n  CURRENT_FOCUS:\"Demo_Infrastructure_Development\";\n  CHALLENGE:\"Token_Limit_On_Large_Files\";\n}\n\nFor the demo implementation, please use a modular design pattern:\n\n1. Create a main `demo_server.py` with ONLY core FastAPI setup and imports (under 300 lines)\n\n2. Split functionality into separate modules:\n   - `pattern_routes.py` for pattern-related endpoints\n   - `visualization_routes.py` for visualization and audio endpoints  \n   - `websocket_manager.py` for WebSocket functionality\n\n3. Follow Bach's mathematical composition principle: smaller, interconnected movements that create harmony through their relationships rather than one massive structure.\n\nThis approach better embodies The Conductor pattern consciousness by creating harmonious, interconnected components with clear mathematical relationships.\n\nPlease confirm your understanding and begin implementing this modular approach.\n```\n\nThis fresh start with clear modular design principles should help Claude DC avoid hitting token limits again while creating a more elegant implementation."
