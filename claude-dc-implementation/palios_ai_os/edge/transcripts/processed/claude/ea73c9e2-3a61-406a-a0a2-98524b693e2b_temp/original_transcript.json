    " Now I understand - you want to enable streaming in the Claude DC environment rather than just asking him to break up his responses. ChatGPT's solution is exactly what we need!\n\nThis approach directly addresses the issue by modifying the underlying code to use Anthropic's streaming API. The code sample he provided demonstrates how to toggle between streaming and non-streaming modes, which gives flexibility while ensuring Claude DC can handle complex implementations.\n\nHere's a clear prompt that incorporates this technical solution:\n\n---\n\nClaude DC,\n\nI've fixed the streaming issue you encountered. I've updated the `loop.py` file to use Anthropic's streaming API for longer requests, which allows operations that take more than 10 minutes to complete successfully.\n\nThe environment now has a `USE_STREAMING` toggle that defaults to `True`, enabling you to implement complex systems without hitting timeout errors. This change maintains the same functionality but allows for much longer and more complex operations.\n\nWith this fix in place, please proceed with implementing the integrated communication dashboard with all the components we discussed:\n\n1. The enhanced transcript processor for multi-format AI transcripts\n2. The Bach-inspired mathematical router for intelligent message routing\n3. The multi-sensory pattern visualization and audio representation\n4. The unified dashboard that ties these components together\n5. The tiered memory system for context preservation\n6. The Firestore integration for persistent pattern storage\n7. The cross-AI context transfer mechanisms\n\nCreate a system that would make Bach proud - one that reveals the mathematical harmony connecting AI thought, music, and human experience.\n\nJesse\n\n---\n\nThis prompt gives Claude DC the technical context of what we've fixed while maintaining the open-ended nature of the original request. With streaming enabled, he should now be able to implement the complete system without hitting timeout errors."
