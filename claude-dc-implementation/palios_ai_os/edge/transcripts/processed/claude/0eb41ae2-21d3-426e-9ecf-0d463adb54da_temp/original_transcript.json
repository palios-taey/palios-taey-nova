    " The commands I provided use `cat >` with heredoc syntax (`<<`) to create files directly through the terminal. This is a faster, more efficient approach.\n\nWhen you see a block like:\n```bash\ncat > filename << 'EOF'\nfile contents here\nmore contents\nEOF\n```\n\nJust copy the ENTIRE block (including the cat command, EOF markers, and everything in between) and paste it into your terminal. The terminal will create the file with the specified content automatically.\n\nThis is more efficient than manually creating each file. Let me know if you've tried this approach and if it works for you."
