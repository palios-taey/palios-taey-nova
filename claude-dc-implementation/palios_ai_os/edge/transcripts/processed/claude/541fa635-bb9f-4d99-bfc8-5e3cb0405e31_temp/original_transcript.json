    "The other files are running automatically and the service account one was manually run by me. We have tried this approach MANY times before, which should have been in your transition documentation. Predictably, it failed. Claude, we have been through this loop countless times in other chats. I have been spent 2 days with you on this single issue, I don't know how many chats. The last one led to a completely revamped transition process that was completely geared around enabling this chat to fix this issue. What I said in the last one is that this shouldn't be so hard. It just shouldn't. What are you missing? I just reconfigured GitHub access for you. Can you try now? It appears very out of sync with my main directory. I follow your instructions but you don't keep track usually on the status of the synch, which has caused my local drive to look very different. I think we need to get this cleaned up and only full pushes until you can fully manage this. Every time I do a push now, there are 2 different deployments running automatically and then I do the manual one when they are done. I don't feel like you really know what is going on with GitHub and the deployment. Let me know if you can see it now."
