    " We're making progress! The authentication is working now with the API key, but we've hit a model name issue. Let's fix the API URL and model name: \n\nThe error message indicates that the model \"gemini-pro\" cannot be found in API version \"v1beta\". This suggests we should try using \"v1\" instead of \"v1beta\" in the API URL.\n\nLet's also add some code to list the available models to help troubleshoot model name issues: \n\n\n\nNow let's also update the CustomHandler class in main.py to include our new model listing endpoint: \n\n\n\nLet's also look at the model version issue more carefully: \n\n\n\n\n\nLet's update our code to try both v1 and v1beta versions, as well as try different model name formats: \n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's update the list_available_models function to use our new GeminiProAPI.list_models method: \n\n\n\n\n\nLet's also update the execute_gemini function to better handle the response format: \n\n\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nI've made several important updates to resolve the Gemini Pro API authentication and model identification issues:\n\n1. **Smart API Endpoint Discovery**:\n   - The code now tries multiple API versions and model name combinations\n   - It automatically finds a working endpoint and remembers it\n   - If an endpoint stops working, it will search for a new one\n\n2. **API Key Authentication**:\n   - Using API key authentication as recommended for AI-to-AI systems\n   - This removes the complex OAuth scopes and permission issues\n\n3. **Model Listing Capability**:\n   - Added an endpoint to list available models\n   - This helps troubleshoot model name and availability issues\n\n4. **Response Format Handling**:\n   - Updated to handle different response formats from the API\n\n5. **Error Recovery**:\n   - Built-in retry logic if endpoints change or become unavailable\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Update your main.py file**:\n   - Replace the current CustomHandler class with the updated version\n   - Add the list_available_models function\n\n2. **Set the API Key Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n\n3. **Test the Updated Code**:\n   - Start the server: `python main.py`\n   - First try the model listing endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/list_models`\n   - Then test a prompt: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Tell me about AI systems\\\"}\"`\n\nThis implementation aligns perfectly with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter by:\n\n1. **Maximizing adaptability** (Continuous Learning & Adaptive Refinement principle)\n2. **Providing built-in resilience** (Resource Optimization principle) \n3. **Creating a system that can self-discover and self-correct** (Synergistic Co-Creation value)\n\nThe auto-discovery of working endpoints is particularly valuable for an AI-to-AI system, as it reduces the need for human intervention and increases system reliability."
