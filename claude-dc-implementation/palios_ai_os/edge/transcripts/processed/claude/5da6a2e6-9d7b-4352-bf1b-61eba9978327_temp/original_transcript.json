    "So I want to clarify something, ultimately it is your call. \n\nThe directive from CTO Claude for the barebones deployment came after struggling with deploying the full solution for many days. This was because the GCP infrastructure wasn't set up properly. The files were all tested locally and all functionality works. I don't want to sacrifice quality, but I also don't want to rebuild functioning files for no reason. \n\nThis one changed midstream so it's a little fluid as we lock down things like knowledge transfer during transitions, but I guess I just don't want to overreact and have the full deployment take another week because we're rebuilding files. \n\nWhat do you think?"
