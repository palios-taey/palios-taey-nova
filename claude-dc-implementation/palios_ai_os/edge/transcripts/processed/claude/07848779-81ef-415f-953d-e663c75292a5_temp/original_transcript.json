    "  \n\n# VALID INSTRUCTIONS REFERENCE GUIDE\n\nHere are the valid instructions from my previous responses in the order you should implement them:\n\n## SEARCH TERMS & IMPLEMENTATION ORDER\n\n1. **GCP Setup & Authentication**: \n   - Search for: \"## 1. Authentication Setup\" in \"Manual Deployment Steps\"\n   - These steps establish your connection to the correct GCP project\n\n2. **Firestore Database Creation**:\n   - Search for: \"## 2. Firestore Setup\" in \"Manual Deployment Steps\"\n   - This creates the foundational database for the memory system\n\n3. **Application File Creation**:\n   - Search for: \"cat > Dockerfile <<EOL\" in my previous message\n   - Use the three file creation commands (Dockerfile, requirements.txt, main.py)\n\n4. **Build & Deployment**:\n   - Search for: \"# Build and push\" in my previous message\n   - Follow the gcloud commands to build, push, and deploy\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Search for: \"## 7. Verify Deployment\" in \"Manual Deployment Steps\"\n   - Ensures the deployment was successful\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, you'll have a functioning minimal viable deployment of PALIOS-TAEY with a working health endpoint.\n\n## CONTINUE - NEXT STEPS\n\nAfter completing the initial deployment, we'll focus on establishing the Charter alignment documentation and implementing the API integrations. This approach allows us to rapidly establish the cloud infrastructure while simultaneously developing the frameworks for AI orientation to the Charter.\n\nThe hybrid deployment approach allows us to overcome the permission challenges while still maintaining a structured, documented process that can be automated in the future."
