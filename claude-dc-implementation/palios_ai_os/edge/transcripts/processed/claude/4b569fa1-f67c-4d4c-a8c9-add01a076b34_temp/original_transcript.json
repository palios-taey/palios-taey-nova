    " Ah, I see the issue with the command formatting. Let's run these as single-line commands:\n\n1. First, verify project:\n```bash\ngcloud config set project ai-execution-system\n```\n\n2. Create the endpoint:\n```bash\ngcloud ai endpoints create --region=us-central1 --display-name=text-generation-endpoint\n```\n\n3. After this succeeds, we'll get an endpoint ID which we'll use in the deployment command.\n\nTry running these first two commands and share the output. I'll help format the next command based on the endpoint ID we receive.\n\nNote: If you get any permission errors, we might need to ensure the proper IAM roles are set up for your account."
