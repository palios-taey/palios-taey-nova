    " I see the issue now. The Firestore document structure is different than expected. Instead of having separate documents for each API key, you have a single document containing all the keys. Let me update the script to handle this structure.\n\n<antThinking>We need to modify the script to handle a single document containing all API keys rather than separate documents for each key.</antThinking> \n\nI've updated the script to:\n1. Handle a single document containing all API keys\n2. Print the first few characters of each key for verification\n3. Properly parse the structure we see in your Firestore\n\nRun the same command:\n```bash\npython connection_test.py\n```\n\nThis should now properly find and use your API keys. Let me know what output you get."
