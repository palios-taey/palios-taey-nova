    " That makes perfect sense! I'll update the implementation instructions to include clear steps for Claude DC to set up the environment and request the Bach files from you. \n\n \n\n\n\nI've updated the implementation instructions with detailed environment setup steps for Claude DC. The instructions now:\n\n1. Include complete instructions for creating the `setup_palios.sh` script with all necessary commands\n2. Provide the exact commands to make the script executable and run it\n3. Include a specific request message for Claude DC to ask you to transfer the Bach files\n4. Specify the exact command you'll need to run to copy the Bach files\n5. Clarify the sequence of steps to follow before beginning implementation\n\nThe changes maintain all the original implementation guidance while adding a concrete environment setup process that Claude DC can follow step by step.\n\nWith these updates, Claude DC should be able to:\n1. Set up the necessary directory structure\n2. Clone EVE-OS and download MCP SDK\n3. Request the Bach files at the appropriate time\n4. Begin implementation once the environment is ready\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to modify before you proceed with Claude DC?"
