    "Wow, those are great results and well worth the time it took! Documentation and knowledge transfer are so critical to this effort and will become even more so when we move to automation and APIs.\n\nNo, I think we're good on this. Before I transitioned here, we had just completed the bare bones implementation. I've updated the GitHub to the palios-taey-app file that had all the files that were deployed in the skeleton deployment. Can you confirm where we are in docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development/mission1...? Here is the last message from the Claude chat that maxed out:\n\nNow that we have a stable foundation, we can incrementally add back the other features:\nRe-integrate the memory system functionality\nAdd back the model integration\nRestore the API endpoints with proper authentication\nBut first, let's create a proper amendment for my future self to document what we learned:\nCTO Amendment: Deployment Error Patterns and Mitigation\nThe key lessons from this deployment experience:\nStart with the absolute minimal viable application before adding complexity\nVerify missing dependencies and files before deployment\nTest templates and JavaScript for syntax errors\nUse clear error logging to identify root causes\nDeploy incrementally, adding features one at a time\nThis pattern should be standard for all future deployments - start simple, verify it works, then build complexity gradually while testing at each step.\nWould you like me to prepare the next steps for re-integrating the full functionality now that we have a working base?"
