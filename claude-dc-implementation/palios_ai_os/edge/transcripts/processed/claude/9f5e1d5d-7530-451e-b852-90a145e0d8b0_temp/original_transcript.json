    " I'll walk you through executing the deployment process step by step, starting with the test file. Let's also address the duplicate files issue to ensure a smooth deployment.\n\n## Step 1: Run the Test API Enablement Workflow\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository (palios-taey-nova)\n2. Navigate to the \"Actions\" tab at the top\n3. You should see the \"Test API Enablement\" workflow in the left sidebar\n4. Click on it, then click the \"Run workflow\" button (dropdown on the right)\n5. Leave the branch as \"main\" and click the green \"Run workflow\" button\n6. Monitor the workflow execution in real-time\n\nDuring this process, watch for:\n- Successful API enablement (all four APIs should be enabled)\n- Successful repository listing or creation\n- Any error messages that might appear\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Test Results\n\nOnce the test workflow completes:\n1. Look at the workflow logs for any errors\n2. Pay special attention to the \"Test Artifact Registry Access\" step\n3. Confirm that either repositories are listed, or you see a message about creating the repository\n\n## Step 3: Run the Deployment Workflow\n\nAfter confirming the test was successful:\n1. Go back to the \"Actions\" tab\n2. Find the \"Deploy via Cloud Build\" workflow in the sidebar\n3. Click on it, then click the \"Run workflow\" button\n4. Leave the branch as \"main\" and click the green \"Run workflow\" button\n5. Monitor the deployment progress\n\nThis workflow will:\n- Enable the APIs again (as a safeguard)\n- Verify/create the repository\n- Build your application using Cloud Build\n- Deploy to Cloud Run\n\n## Step 4: Verify Deployment\n\nOnce the deployment workflow completes:\n1. Look for the service URL in the \"Show URL\" step output\n2. Open that URL in your browser\n3. Add \"/health\" to the URL to check the health endpoint\n4. You should see a successful response indicating all components are operational\n\n## Regarding Duplicate Files\n\nDuplicate files in the repository could potentially cause issues during deployment, especially if they contain conflicting code. Here's what to do:\n\n1. Before running the workflows, let's check if this is a critical issue:\n   - Are these exact duplicates or modified versions?\n   - Are they in the source code directories that might affect the application?\n\n2. If they're exact duplicates in non-critical locations, you can likely proceed with deployment as-is, and we can clean up afterward.\n\n3. If they're modified duplicates or in critical paths, we should resolve this before deployment by:\n   - Determining which versions are correct\n   - Removing the duplicates\n   - Committing these changes to the repository\n\nWithout direct access to see the specific duplicates, I recommend proceeding with the test workflow first. If it succeeds, we can likely move forward with deployment and address the duplicate files as a separate cleanup task afterward.\n\nDoes this approach make sense? Would you like me to help diagnose the duplicate files issue further before proceeding?"
