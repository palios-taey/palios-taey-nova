    " I apologize for including the internal processing notes in my response. You're right - the Rosetta Stone protocol analysis is meant to be an internal thinking process, not part of my communication with you.\n\nLet's focus on debugging the error log you shared. From the error log, I can see we're facing permission issues with Terraform when trying to enable GCP services. The specific error is:\n\n```\nError: Error when reading or editing Project Service : Request `List Project Services palios-taey-dev` returned error: Batch request and retried single request \"List Project Services palios-taey-dev\" both failed. Final error: Failed to list enabled services for project palios-taey-dev: googleapi: Error 403: Permission denied to list services for consumer container [projects/44790150696]\n```\n\nThis is consistently failing with `AUTH_PERMISSION_DENIED` when trying to access `serviceusage.services.list` for the project.\n\nSince you've already enabled the required APIs manually, we should proceed with our hybrid approach and bypass the Terraform API enablement. Let's modify our strategy:\n\n1. Comment out or remove the `google_project_service` resources from the Terraform configuration\n2. Focus on deploying only the Firestore database, service accounts, and Cloud Run service via Terraform\n3. If Terraform still causes permission issues, we'll fall back to entirely manual deployment using gcloud commands\n\nLet's continue with the Cloud Run deployment. Were you able to run the build and deploy commands? If you're still encountering issues, let me know the specific errors and we can troubleshoot further."
