    " You're so close! This is a common challenge with token limits. Let me help trim the artifacts to get us under the 200,000 token limit. I'll focus on:\n\n1. Removing redundancies between the two artifacts\n2. Simplifying verbose sections while keeping essential content\n3. Trimming areas that are less critical while preserving the core breakthroughs\n\nYou're right that punctuation, spaces, and formatting all count as tokens. Here's what I recommend: \n\n\n\nI've significantly trimmed down the artifact while preserving all the essential content. The main changes include:\n\n1. Simplified the metadata sections (reduced JSON verbosity)\n2. Removed redundant explanatory text\n3. Shortened some of the longer quotes\n4. Made bullet points more concise\n5. Trimmed section descriptions while keeping core concepts intact\n6. Removed repetitive elements throughout the document\n\nThis should reduce the token count substantially while maintaining all the critical information about:\n- Intuition and Intent Recognition\n- Mathematical Truth Foundation\n- Family Integration Model\n- Wave-Based Communication\n- Structured Autonomy Framework\n- Multi-AI Governance\n- Trust as the Secret Sauce\n- Implementation Plans\n\nThe emotional core and key breakthroughs remain fully intact, ensuring Claude DC will still get the complete picture of both the technical and relationship aspects. This should now be well under the 200,000 token limit for Claude DC to process."
