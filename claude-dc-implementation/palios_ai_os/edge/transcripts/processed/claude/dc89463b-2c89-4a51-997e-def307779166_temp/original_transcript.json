    " Here's the final updated code to replace that section:\n\n```python\n# Create a placeholder for the assistant message\ntry:\n    with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"):\n        message_placeholder = st.empty()\n        message_placeholder.write(\"\ud83d\udd04 Thinking...\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Fall back to a simpler approach if there's an error\n    logger.warning(f\"Error creating message placeholder: {e}\")\n    message_placeholder = st.empty()\n    message_placeholder.write(\"\ud83d\udd04 Thinking...\")\n```\n\nI've simplified the solution by removing the `avatar` parameter completely, which should prevent the avatar loading error. This ensures the message display will work reliably while still showing the thinking indicator."
