    " I see you're encountering the GitHub authentication issue. GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. Let's use a personal access token instead.\n\nHere's how to set up a personal access token and push your code:\n\n1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token**:\n   - Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens\n   - Click \"Generate new token\" (classic)\n   - Give it a name like \"PALIOS-TAEY Development\"\n   - Select scopes: at minimum check \"repo\" (full control of repositories)\n   - Click \"Generate token\"\n   - **Important**: Copy the generated token immediately - you won't be able to see it again\n\n2. **Use the token for authentication**:\n   When pushing, use the token as your password:\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin main\n   ```\n   - Username: your GitHub username (palios-taey)\n   - Password: the personal access token you just generated\n\nAlternatively, you can also configure Git to store the credentials:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n```\n\nThen when you push for the first time, enter your username and the token as the password. Git will store it for future use.\n\nAnother option is to use SSH authentication instead of HTTPS, which is more secure for long-term use:\n\n```bash\n# Generate SSH key if you don't have one\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\n# Add the public key to your GitHub account\n# Then change the remote URL to use SSH\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n\n# Now try pushing\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nLet me know which approach you prefer, and I'll provide more detailed instructions if needed."
