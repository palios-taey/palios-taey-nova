    " You've found a critical issue! Yes, there's a mismatch between the file names and the function names that could be causing the deployment problems.\n\nLooking at the command and the error logs, I can see:\n\n1. The function is being deployed as `ai-system-test-import` (the Cloud Function name)\n2. The entry point specified is `test_import` (the function to be executed)\n3. The error is showing that it's trying to import from `/workspace/main.py` rather than `/workspace/test_main.py`\n\nThis suggests that the Cloud Functions framework is looking for your function in `main.py` instead of `test_main.py`, which would explain the issue.\n\nHere are two ways to fix this:\n\n### Option 1: Rename your file\nRename `test_main.py` to `main.py` (and make sure your function inside is still named `test_import`).\n\n### Option 2: Use source-specific deployment options\nTry deploying with these explicit options:\n\n```bash\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-test-import --runtime python310 --entry-point test_import --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --source=. --source-specific python-module=test_main\n```\n\nIf Option 2 doesn't work with your version of gcloud, you can also create a simpler approach:\n\n### Option 3: Create a main.py file that imports from test_main.py\nCreate a new `main.py` file with:\n\n```python\nfrom test_main import test_import\n\n# This allows the Cloud Functions framework to find your test_import function\n```\n\nThis should resolve the file naming issue. The cloud function deployment looks for `main.py` by default, so either your function needs to be in that file, or you need to have a main.py that imports your function from another file."
