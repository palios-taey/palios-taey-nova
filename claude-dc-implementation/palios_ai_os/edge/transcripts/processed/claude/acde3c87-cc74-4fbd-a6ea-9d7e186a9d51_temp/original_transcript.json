    " It looks like there's an issue with the EOF marker in the heredoc. When using the heredoc syntax (`<< 'EOF'`), the terminal expects to see the closing `EOF` on a line by itself with no whitespace before or after it.\n\nLet me fix this for you with a simpler approach that will work better:\n\n```bash\ncat > docs/development/file_deduplication_strategy.md << 'EOF'\n# File Deduplication Strategy\n\nThis document outlines the strategy for identifying and resolving file duplications in the PALIOS-TAEY codebase.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe existing codebase contains multiple versions of the same files with slight variations, making it unclear which is the authoritative version. For example:\n- `memory_service.py`, `memory_service_v2.py`, `memory_service_new.py`\n- Multiple implementations of the same functionality with different approaches\n- Outdated files that should be deprecated\n\n## Identification Process\n\n### 1. Exact Duplicates\n\nFiles with identical content will be identified using MD5 hash comparison. This provides a quick way to find exact duplicates regardless of filename or location.\n\n### 2. Similar Files\n\nFor files that are similar but not identical:\n\n1. **Name-Based Grouping**: Files with similar base names are grouped together (e.g., `memory_service.py`, `memory_service_v2.py`)\n2. **Content Similarity Analysis**: Within each group, content similarity is measured using the Sequence Matcher algorithm\n3. **Threshold-Based Grouping**: Files with similarity above a defined threshold (default: 80%) are considered part of the same group\n\n### 3. Metadata Analysis\n\nAdditional metadata is collected to help determine the authoritative version:\n- Last modified timestamp\n- File size\n- Location in directory structure\n- Naming patterns (presence of version indicators like `_v2`, `_new`, etc.)\n\n## Resolution Strategy\n\n### For Exact Duplicates\n\n1. **Select the most recent version** based on modification timestamp\n2. **Prioritize files without version indicators** in the name (e.g., prefer `memory_service.py` over `memory_service_v2.py`)\n3. **Create symlinks if needed** to maintain backward compatibility during transition\n\n### For Similar Files\n\n1. **Identify the \"base\" implementation** - typically the newest file without version indicators\n2. **Perform a manual diff review** to identify unique features in each variant\n3. **Merge unique features** into the base implementation\n4. **Add comprehensive tests** to ensure all functionality is preserved\n5. **Document decisions** in a migration log\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Scanning Phase**: Run the deduplication script on both the GitHub repository and local files\n2. **Analysis Phase**: Generate a comprehensive report of duplicates and similar files\n3. **Decision Phase**: Review the report and make decisions on file selection\n4. **Migration Phase**: Implement the decisions, merging features as needed\n5. **Verification Phase**: Test thoroughly to ensure no functionality is lost\n\n## Tools and Automation\n\nThe following script has been developed to automate the identification process:\n- `scripts/file_deduplication.py`\n\nThis script can:\n- Identify exact duplicates using content hashing\n- Find similar files using sequence matching\n- Generate comprehensive reports with recommendations\n- Provide a clear view of all duplications in the codebase\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Run the deduplication script on the old and new repositories\npython scripts/file_deduplication.py ~/palios-taey-nova-archive ~/palios-taey-nova --output deduplication_report.json\n\n# Review the report and make decisions\n# This step is manual and requires developer judgment\n\n# Create a migration plan based on the report\n# Implement the migration plan with proper testing\n```\n\n## Migration Log\n\nA migration log should be maintained to document all decisions:\n\n| Original Files | Selected File | Reason | Features Merged | Date |\n|----------------|---------------|--------|----------------|------|\n| `memory_service_v1.py`, `memory_service_v2.py` | `memory_service.py` | Most recent, comprehensive | V2 tier migration | 2025-03-13 |\nEOF\n```\n\nAs an alternative, let's try a different approach. Instead of using heredoc, let's create the file using a text editor:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/development\nnano docs/development/file_deduplication_strategy.md\n```\n\nThen paste the content into the nano editor, save with Ctrl+O and exit with Ctrl+X.\n\nLet me know which approach works better for you."
