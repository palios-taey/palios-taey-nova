    " In a terminal window, the standard paste shortcut is usually Shift+Insert or right-clicking with your mouse. If those aren't working, you can try these alternatives:\n\n1. Middle mouse button click (if you have a 3-button mouse or scroll wheel)\n2. Ctrl+Shift+V (this often works when Ctrl+V doesn't)\n3. Select text and right-click to see if a context menu appears with paste option\n\nIf you're in a specific terminal emulator like tmux or screen, you might need a special command like:\n- In tmux: Ctrl+B, then ]\n- In screen: Ctrl+A, then ]\n\nAs a last resort, you could:\n1. Save the commands to a file\n2. Use \"scp\" or similar to transfer the file to Claude DC's environment\n3. Run the file with \"bash filename.sh\"\n\nLet me know if any of these methods work for you!"
