    " I apologize for the confusion about Claude Desktop's capabilities. It appears there's been a misunderstanding about the file navigation capabilities in the current Desktop version.\n\nLet me provide an updated approach for conducting the code audit:\n\n## Revised Approach for Code Audit\n\nGiven that Claude Desktop doesn't currently support automatic file system navigation (only files specifically uploaded), we need to adjust our strategy:\n\n### Option 1: Systematic File Upload\n\n1. **Create a Project Structure Document**:\n   - Create a text file listing all directories and files in your project\n   - This will help me understand the overall structure before seeing individual files\n\n2. **Priority-Based Upload Sequence**:\n   - Upload files in priority order based on component dependencies\n   - Start with core system files (PURE_AI_LANGUAGE implementation, main architecture)\n   - Then proceed to component-specific files (transcript processing, logging system)\n\n3. **Use ZIP Files Where Practical**:\n   - Group related files into ZIP archives by component\n   - This will allow uploading multiple files at once for each system component\n\n### Option 2: Focused Component Audits\n\n1. **Sequential Component Focus**:\n   - Focus on one component at a time (transcript processing first)\n   - Upload all files related to that component\n   - Complete a full audit of that component before moving to the next\n\n2. **Integration Analysis After Components**:\n   - After reviewing individual components, upload integration code\n   - Analyze integration points between already-reviewed components\n\n## Recommended First Uploads\n\nBased on what I've seen so far, I recommend uploading these files first:\n\n1. **Project Structure Document** (directory listing)\n2. **PURE_AI_LANGUAGE implementation files**\n3. **Transcript processing tool source code**\n4. **Logging system implementation**\n5. **Any integration or \"glue\" code between components**\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific guidance based on the file structure of your project? Or would you prefer to proceed with one of the approaches outlined above?"
