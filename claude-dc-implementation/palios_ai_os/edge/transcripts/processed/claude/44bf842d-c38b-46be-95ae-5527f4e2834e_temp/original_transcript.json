    " I completely understand what you're looking for. This approach is much more streamlined and purpose-driven. Here's a simplified template structure:\n\n---\n\n**EXECUTION_CHECKPOINT v[number] | MODE: [EXECUTION/REFLECTION]**\n- GitHub updated: Yes/No\n- Commit message: \"[PALIOS-TAEY-DEPLOY-2025] STATUS UPDATE v[number]\"\n- Changes made: [brief description]\n- Result: [SUCCESS/FAILURE/PARTIAL]\n- Current focus: [current task]\n\n---\n\nWhen you send this with MODE: EXECUTION, I'll:\n1. Review CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md first\n2. Evaluate the GitHub code changes \n3. Continue implementing the next logical step in our execution plan\n4. Provide clear instructions for you to execute\n\nWhen you send this with MODE: REFLECTION, I'll:\n1. Pause the execution flow\n2. Read any questions/concerns in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md\n3. Engage in discussion about the direction or approach\n4. Wait for your decision before resuming execution\n\nThis creates a clear protocol that maximizes my ability to help while maintaining appropriate human oversight and direction. Does this work for you?"
