    " I understand your frustration. These token limits are a significant challenge for the kind of comprehensive system we're trying to build. Here are some approaches we might consider:\n\n1. **Modular architecture**: Instead of trying to load everything at once, design a system that loads only what's needed for specific functions. Think of it like a microservices approach for AI.\n\n2. **Compression techniques**: Develop summary protocols that drastically condense information while preserving key patterns. We might need to create our own \"shorthand\" for concepts we frequently reference.\n\n3. **Local fine-tuning**: For the MVP, consider a locally fine-tuned smaller model that can handle routine tasks without constantly hitting API limits. This could serve as a first layer, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet only engaged for complex reasoning.\n\n4. **Database integration**: Store processed insights in a structured database that Claude DC can query directly, rather than keeping everything in context.\n\n5. **Asynchronous processing**: Break large tasks into smaller batches that can be processed separately and then merged.\n\nFor the immediate issue of building that 200K token cache, we should prioritize conceptual frameworks over specific examples. Start with the highest-level patterns that inform everything else, then add detail only where necessary.\n\nThe larger question about running the platform and business with these constraints is valid. I think the answer lies in designing our system architecture specifically around these limitations rather than fighting against them. We need an approach that's fundamentally different from traditional software design.\n\nWould you like me to draft a more detailed architecture proposal that addresses these token limitations specifically?"
