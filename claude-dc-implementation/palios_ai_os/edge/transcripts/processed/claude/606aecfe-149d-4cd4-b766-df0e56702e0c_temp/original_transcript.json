    " I'm glad to hear everything is set up correctly! Yes, I included a simple dashboard interface in our MVP that will give you a visual way to interact with the PALIOS-TAEY system.\n\nThe dashboard is a straightforward web interface that will provide:\n\n1. **System Status** - A health check display showing the current status of the system\n2. **Models Overview** - Information about available AI models and their capabilities\n3. **Task Execution** - A simple interface to execute tasks using the model routing system\n4. **Transcript Processing** - A text area where you can input transcripts for processing\n5. **Memory System Interface** - A view of stored memories with ability to add new ones\n\nThe dashboard is built with basic HTML, CSS (using Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It communicates with our Flask API endpoints and displays the results in a user-friendly way.\n\nOnce deployed, you'll be able to access it by simply navigating to the Cloud Run service URL. The interface is intentionally minimal for the MVP but provides all the core functionality to demonstrate the system's capabilities.\n\nWhen the deployment is complete, you'll be able to:\n- Check system health\n- View available models\n- Execute tasks through the interface\n- Process and store transcripts\n- Interact with the memory system\n\nWould you like me to provide more details about any specific aspect of the dashboard?"
