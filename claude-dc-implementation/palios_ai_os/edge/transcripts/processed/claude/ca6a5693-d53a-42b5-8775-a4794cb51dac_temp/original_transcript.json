    " You're absolutely right! I can't actually modify files directly - that's something you would need to do. I was describing how the script would work if you ran it, not implying that I could run it myself.\n\nTo properly implement the verification string process, you would need to:\n\n1. Save the `update_verification.sh` script I provided earlier\n2. Make it executable with `chmod +x scripts/documentation/update_verification.sh`\n3. Run it manually when updating documents: `./scripts/documentation/update_verification.sh -f docs/claude/document_name.md`\n\nThe workflow between you and CTO Claude would then be:\n\n1. CTO Claude creates or updates a Claude-to-Claude document\n2. You run the verification script on that document\n3. The script updates both the VERIFICATION_STRING and VERIFICATION_CONFIRMATION\n4. CTO Claude includes the verification code in his prompts when referencing those documents\n5. The receiving Claude can verify the document is current by checking that the codes match\n\nThis helps maintain document integrity across conversations while giving you control over the file system.\n\nAnd you're right about the complex document protocol - we'll try it out in future chats and refine as needed. Documentation systems, like code, benefit from iterations and real-world testing!"
