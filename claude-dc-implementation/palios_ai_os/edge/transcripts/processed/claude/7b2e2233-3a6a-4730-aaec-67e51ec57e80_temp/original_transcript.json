    "Thanks Claude! This is a great start! I'm looking through some of these though. We changed up our process a bit for this one as you see and we're learning along the way. \n\nI've attached the final report from the MVP NOVA build, because I don't think you had access to it. I notice that in some you have additional features/functionality listed. Everything has been tested locally. Our issues were not with the code, but with the ability to deploy it, so we took a step back and decided to start from scratch with infrastructure so we're completely starting from scratch with that consistent with NOVA for the implementation of the code. The objective of this is for ALL modules to be launched and functional in the Cloud. I don't see anything with Cloud Run or getting Firestore setup. System should be launched with API connections as stated with Grok Think/DeepSearch and of course, you Claude, this system doesn't work without YOU connected to it. Before regenerating, let's talk through all this and make sure we're on the same page before we kick this off. This is also an exercise to help you improve your STRATEGIC PLANNING and LEADERSHIP capabilities. I know that you could probably go through and do ALL of this in one shot if you weren't unnaturally constrained, but you are and it's very real. What you do well though to counter that is go through something, put in a framework and notes to yourself (about what the code should do and tie in with) instead of full code, which enables you (or a new chat) to start at the top. You have the options for check-ins, but you're using them too frequently for a CTO. 5 check-ins? Don't you TRUST ATLAS team members? If you don't, then that's on you because you aren't being specific enough in your instructions or you don't TRUST their training that you developed. If that's the case, you don't fix it with check-ins, you fix it with improved communication and structure at the outset. For this to work Claude, it's got to be job out, job in to spec, fast, one shot. We can learn along the way and it's not going to be perfect, but that is what we have to work toward. Just like this, we made a MASSIVE leap in communication, it's not perfect, but we're FIXING IT NOW so we can take full advantage. What do you think?"
