    " Looking at the full `store` method, I can see that it's well-structured and properly handling most cases. The issue isn't with this primary implementation but rather with the mock implementation in the `_create_mock_memory` method where a similar `store` method is defined for the MockMemorySystem class.\n\nLet's keep this primary implementation intact and fix the issue in the MockMemorySystem class. Please find the `_create_mock_memory` method in the file (likely around line 254 based on error logs) and modify the store method within that mock class.\n\nHere's what you need to add to the MockMemorySystem's store method:\n\n```python\ndef store(self, content, context_id=None, metadata=None, tags=None, relationships=None, initial_tier=1):\n    # Generate ID if not in metadata\n    if metadata is None:\n        metadata = {}\n    memory_id = metadata.get('memory_id', str(uuid.uuid4()))\n    \n    # Store the item\n    self.items[memory_id] = {\n        'memory_id': memory_id,\n        'content': content,\n        'metadata': metadata,\n        'tags': tags or [],\n        'relationships': relationships or []\n    }\n    \n    # Add to context if provided\n    if context_id and context_id in self.contexts:\n        context = self.contexts[context_id]\n        if 'active_memory_ids' not in context:\n            context['active_memory_ids'] = []\n        context['active_memory_ids'].append(memory_id)\n    \n    return memory_id\n```\n\nThe key change is the addition of `if metadata is None: metadata = {}` before attempting to access metadata with `.get()`.\n\nPlease locate and update just this method in the mock class, then test again."
