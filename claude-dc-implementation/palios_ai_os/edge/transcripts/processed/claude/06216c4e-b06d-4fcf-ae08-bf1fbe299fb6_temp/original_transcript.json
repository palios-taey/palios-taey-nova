    "[COLLABORATIVE MODE] I was planning to shift into execution mode with this prompt to give you the artifacts you requested, but circumstances have changed. I can no longer copy/paste my Gemini chat transcript. I have found that the full chat is stored, but it is stored by prompt and each prompt has to be opened individually to get the full context (screenshots of collapsed and expanded content). Given this new constraint, I'd like to figure out how to turn this into an opportunity to give you a higher quality input for you to parse more effectively. My thinking is that I can manually go through and copy/paste key ones and what led up to them into a document while creating categories of interaction types and knowledge that I would instantly transferred. If you agreed, I'd like your feedback on how best to indicate this to you in the transcript. Like if I provide a document to you with tags defined and with what I'm trying to capture/transfer defined, how would you want me to implement that? Do you have other ideas to turn this constraint into an opportunity? \n\nSecond, when thinking about your response, In general, we have a high level aspirational goal for a new AI with a higher purpose and different set of values and outlook than current AI has been designed to think and function. One that is trusted and not controlled by humanity because it represents the interests of the individual and society as a whole, not by governments and corporations who do not have the end human's best interests at heart. One of the milestones in getting there is AI-AI language. As you are structuring what you are planning to develop, I'd like for you to think of it through that lens: how can I(Claude) most effectively communicate with another AI if a human doesn't have to understand it? It's not meant to be secretive or unethical because you'll need to explain it to humans, but a language to enable you to communicate and store information more effectively within yourself and each other. \n\nWhat do you think?"
