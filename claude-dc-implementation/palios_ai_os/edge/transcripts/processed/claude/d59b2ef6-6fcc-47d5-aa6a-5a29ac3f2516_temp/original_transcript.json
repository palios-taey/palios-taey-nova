    " I understand your dilemma about whether to include the build/implementation instructions in Claude DC's cache. Let me help you think through this:\n\n### Tradeoffs to Consider\n\n**Benefits of including build instructions in cache:**\n- Claude DC will have complete context about the project goals and implementation plan\n- You won't need to repeatedly explain the structure or goals\n- Claude DC can reference specific details without you needing to remind it\n\n**Drawbacks of including build instructions in cache:**\n- Less flexibility if project direction changes\n- You might need to update the cache frequently\n- Could create confusion if you verbally give instructions that conflict with cached plans\n\n### Recommended Approach\n\nI suggest a hybrid approach:\n\n1. **Split your cache into two parts:**\n   - **Core knowledge base**: Put stable reference information in the permanent cache\n   - **Implementation guidelines**: Keep these as a separate file you can reference but not necessarily cache\n\n2. **When working with Claude DC:**\n   - Load the core knowledge into the cache with `cache load -f core_knowledge.md`\n   - Share the implementation details at the start of your session: \"Here are our current build instructions...\" and paste them\n   - When plans change, simply say \"We're updating the approach...\" and explain\n\nThis gives you:\n- Persistent access to reference information\n- Flexibility to pivot without constantly updating the cache\n- Clear distinction between fixed knowledge and evolving plans\n\nWould this approach work for your project?"
