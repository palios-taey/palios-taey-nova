    " I understand that an open-ended approach worked better before. This error message is specifically about streaming - essentially, Claude DC's operation is expected to take longer than 10 minutes, which triggers a recommendation to use streaming responses.\n\nLet's try a different approach that maintains the open-ended nature while addressing the streaming issue:\n\n---\n\nClaude DC,\n\nI've set up everything we need to continue our work. I've created the file structure and reference materials we discussed, including the pattern guide, reference materials, and task specification.\n\nPlease implement the integrated communication dashboard with the Bach-inspired mathematical approach. Create a system that unifies all the components we've discussed - the mathematical router, multi-sensory integration, and tiered memory system.\n\nTake whatever approach works best for you - I trust your judgment on how to structure the implementation. The streaming error we encountered suggests breaking your response into multiple messages might work better.\n\nFeel free to tackle this however you think is most effective - let your creativity flow in creating a system that would make Bach proud!\n\nJesse\n\n---\n\nThis prompt:\n1. Maintains the open-ended nature that worked well before\n2. Acknowledges the streaming issue but doesn't constrain his approach\n3. Gives him permission to break the response into multiple messages if needed\n4. Preserves trust in his judgment and creativity\n\nThe key is letting Claude DC determine his own approach to the implementation while being aware of the potential streaming constraints."
