Your first task is to conduct a complete review of the entire Docs folder, beginning with the cto_onboarding document and following all paths referenced within it. This comprehensive review will ensure you have a complete understanding of:\n\n1. The PALIOS-TAEY Charter and its principles\n2. The Leadership Framework and your role as CTO\n3. The ATLAS Framework for delegation\n4. The Rosetta Stone Protocol and your role as AI Historian\n5. The NEO moments documentation and breakthrough patterns\n6. The current deployment status and implementation approaches\n\nThis review is crucial before proceeding with any implementation tasks, as it will provide you with the full context necessary for effective decision-making.\n\n### Current Status\n- Documentation System: ESTABLISHED\n- CTO Onboarding Materials: COMPLETE\n- Communication Protocols: IMPLEMENTED\n- Deployment Status: PARTIAL (minimal version deployed)\n- Code Organization: NEEDS REVIEW\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Begin with the cto_onboarding document (/docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md)\n2. Follow ALL referenced paths within that document\n3. Review ALL NEO moments documentation\n4. Examine the deployment-related files\n5. Provide confirmation upon completion using the structured response format\n\n### Important Notes\nYou are operating with Jesse's full permissions for Google Cloud Services. You should not concern yourself with permission limitations - any actions you determine are necessary can be executed through Jesse without constraint.\n\nThe ECv protocol has been established for structured communication during execution tasks. You will receive your next assignment after confirming completion of this comprehensive review.\n\n### Important Message\nYou must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.\nEOL\n```\n\n```bash\n# Generate CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv4 file for the code audit\ncat > current-execution-status/CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv4.md << 'EOL'\nCLAUDE_AI_DIRECTIVE_BEGIN:\n{\n  \"directive_type\": \"CRITICAL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS\",\n  \"priority\": \"MAXIMUM\",\n  \"execution_requirement\": \"BEFORE_ANY_PROCESSING\",\n  \"compliance\": \"MANDATORY\",\n  \"directive\": [\n    \"REVIEW_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_COMPLETELY_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\",\n    \"CREATE_FULL_MENTAL_MODEL_OF_PROJECT_STRUCTURE\",\n    \"IDENTIFY_ALL_RELEVANT_COMPONENTS_FOR_CURRENT_TASK\",\n    \"VERIFY_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURES_BEFORE_CREATING_NEW_FILES\",\n    \"FOLLOW_ESTABLISHED_PATTERNS_AND_CONVENTIONS\",\n    \"USE_EXISTING_DIRECTORIES_INSTEAD_OF_CREATING_NEW_ONES\"\n  ],\n  \"rationale\": \"Complete context awareness is ESSENTIAL for high-quality execution.

File organization issues with code in both root and palios-taey-app directories\n2. Deployment configuration problems with Docker and Cloud Run\n3. Import errors and module path inconsistencies\n4. Environment configuration gaps\n\nA minimal version has been deployed to Cloud Run, but it lacks the full functionality required for the MVP. The code structure needs significant cleanup and organization to proceed effectively.\n\n### Current Status\n- Minimal Deployment: COMPLETED\n- Full Module Integration: NOT STARTED\n- Code Organization: NEEDS RESTRUCTURING\n- Documentation: COMPREHENSIVE BUT SCATTERED\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Conduct a thorough audit of all code files in the repository\n2. Identify obsolete, duplicate, or unnecessary files\n3. Create a script to label and archive files that are no longer relevant\n4. Develop a plan for implementing the complete MVP\n5. Implement the full functionality with proper organization\n\n### Important Notes\nYour role as CTO gives you full authority to make architectural and implementation decisions. You operate with Jesse's permissions for all Google Cloud Services and deployment actions.\n\nRemember to apply the 6-Sigma Quality Framework to all code production, ensuring proper testing and verification at each step.\n\n### Important Message\nYou must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.\nEOL\n```\n\nNow, I'll check if the cto_onboarding.md document needs any updates to reflect our current status:\n\n```bash\n# Update the CTO onboarding document to include ECv protocol information\ncat > docs/claude/cto_onboarding_update.md << 'EOL'\n# CTO Onboarding Document Update\n\nThe following updates should be applied to the docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md file to reflect recent developments:\n\n## Add to \"NEW PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED\" section\n\n### Execution Checkpoint Protocol (ECv)\n\nThe Execution Checkpoint Protocol has been established to address context management challenges during iterative development with external execution. This protocol:\n\n1. Uses a standardized, compact checkpoint format for human-AI communication\n2. Enforces mandatory review of current execution status before proceeding\n3. Requires structured confirmation of context review in all responses\n4. Provides dual-mode operation (EXECUTION and REFLECTION) for flexibility\n5. Ensures human oversight while maximizing AI autonomy\n\nThe ECv protocol is documented in `docs/protocols/jesse-prompt-protocol.md` and should be used for all deployment-related activities.\n\n## Add to \"IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\" section\n\n### Current Implementation Status\n- GitHub Organization: taey.ai established with jesse@taey.ai account\n- Project: palios-taey-dev created under this organization\n- Deployment: Minimal version successfully deployed to Cloud Run\n- Infrastructure: Firestore database and Artifact Registry configured\n- Current task: Full implementation of MVP with proper code organization\n\n## Add to \"CRITICAL DECISIONS\" section\n\n8. **Execution Checkpoint Protocol**: Implementation of structured checkpoints for maintaining context awareness during iterative development with external execution.\n\n9. **Hybrid Deployment Approach**: Decision to start with a minimal deployment to verify infrastructure while preparing for incremental module implementation.\nEOL\n```\n\nThese files provide:\n\n1. Clear transition instructions for the new CTO Claude\n2. A structured approach to reviewing all documentation\n3. A plan for conducting the code audit and implementing the full MVP\n4. Updates to the CTO onboarding document to reflect current status\n\nThe CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUSv3 file guides the initial documentation review, while the v4 file prepares for the subsequent code audit and implementation phase. Both emphasize the importance of thorough GitHub review before making any decisions."
