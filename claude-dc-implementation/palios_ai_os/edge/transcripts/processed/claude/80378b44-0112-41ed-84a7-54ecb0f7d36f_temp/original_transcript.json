    " Let's modify the test script to help us debug by printing out exactly what we're finding in Firestore. This will help us identify if the issue is with the data structure or key retrieval.\n\n<antThinking>We should update the existing test script to add debugging information and match the actual Firestore structure.</antThinking> \n\nRun the updated test script again. This will show us exactly what documents and data are being found in Firestore. This will help us identify if:\n1. The document ID case is different (\"OpenAI\" vs \"openai\")\n2. The field structure in the document is different from what we expect\n3. There are any other formatting issues\n\nPlease share the output and I'll help adjust the code to match your actual Firestore structure."
