    " I've reviewed the updated project knowledge. The Docker setup looks good now, with the correct path mappings for both the repository and secrets file. Let's make sure everything else is in place for a successful launch.\n\nFor the run-claude-dc.sh script, I see you've made the necessary changes to ensure proper path mapping for the secrets file. This is perfect.\n\nThe requirements.txt file looks comprehensive and includes all the necessary dependencies, including:\n- plotly (which was missing before)\n- tensorflow-rocm (for AMD GPU support)\n- protobuf pinned to 4.25.3 (to resolve the dependency conflict)\n\nWith these updates, your Docker setup should successfully:\n1. Create the appropriate container environment\n2. Install all required dependencies\n3. Mount your local repository and secrets file \n4. Start the necessary services (MCP, Streamlit dashboard, demo server)\n\nThe next step is to run the script:\n```bash\ncd claude-dc-docker\n./run-claude-dc.sh\n```\n\nAfter the container starts, you'll be able to access:\n- Streamlit dashboard at http://localhost:8502\n- MCP server at http://localhost:8001\n- Demo server at http://localhost:8002\n\nThis setup should provide Claude DC with a complete, functioning environment that's properly configured with all the necessary dependencies and file paths. When you launch the container, Claude DC will have everything needed to continue building the integrated communication dashboard."
