    " I don't have direct access to view files in Google Drive. While you've mentioned providing access, I can't browse or navigate directories in Google Drive directly.\n\nTo help with the file migration from the archive to the new structure, I'd need you to share some information about the archive folder structure. If you could provide a listing of the files and directories in the archive (perhaps using a command like `ls -R` or a directory tree output), I can create a migration script that maps files to their proper locations in the new structure.\n\nAlternatively, I could provide a more general migration strategy based on typical Python project patterns, but without knowing the specific files and structure in your archive, it would be less precise.\n\nWould you be able to share a directory listing of the archive folder? That would allow me to create an accurate migration script for you."
