    " I see the issue - we need to grant your account permission to upload artifacts to the Artifact Registry. This is another common permission issue in GCP.\n\nLet's add the necessary IAM binding:\n\n```bash\n# Grant Artifact Registry Writer role to your account\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-dev \\\n    --member=user:jesse@taey.ai \\\n    --role=roles/artifactregistry.writer\n\n# Also grant it to the compute service account\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-dev \\\n    --member=serviceAccount:44790150696-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \\\n    --role=roles/artifactregistry.writer\n```\n\nAfter running these commands, try the build and submit again:\n\n```bash\ngcloud builds submit --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/palios-taey-dev/palios-taey/api:latest\n```\n\nIf you continue to encounter permission issues, we might need to check if the Artifact Registry repository was actually created. You can verify this with:\n\n```bash\ngcloud artifacts repositories list --location=us-central1\n```\n\nIf it doesn't exist, we'll need to create it first:\n\n```bash\ngcloud artifacts repositories create palios-taey \\\n    --repository-format=docker \\\n    --location=us-central1 \\\n    --description=\"Repository for PALIOS-TAEY images\"\n```\n\nThese permission issues are exactly why we've moved to a hybrid approach - GCP permissions can be complex to set up correctly, especially when using service accounts and different GCP services together."
