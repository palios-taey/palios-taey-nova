    " It looks like Claude DC is having an authentication issue with the API key. This error suggests that the API key being used is invalid or has expired.\n\nHere are a few potential solutions:\n\n1. **API Key Rotation**: The API key might have been automatically rotated or expired. Claude DC might need a new API key.\n\n2. **Environment Variable Issue**: The environment variable storing the API key might not be properly set.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting**: If you've been making many requests, you might be hitting rate limits, though the error would typically be different.\n\nSince you're seeing a specific \"invalid x-api-key\" error, I recommend asking Claude DC to try the following:\n\n```\n# Check if the API key environment variable is set\necho $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | wc -c\n\n# If the above returns a very small number (like 1), the variable is empty\n# You might need to set it again or obtain a new key\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could try using Claude DC's built-in commands without relying on the API:\n\n```\n# Try downloading directly using curl\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/yourfile.md > temp.md\n\n# Check if the file downloaded successfully\nls -la temp.md\n\n# Then load it into cache\ncache load -f temp.md\n```\n\nThis approach bypasses the API authentication that's causing the error and uses Claude DC's built-in capabilities instead."
