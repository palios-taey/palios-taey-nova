    " I see the issue now. Thanks for sharing the test results. This is an authentication error with Workload Identity Federation. Let's fix this immediately.\n\nThe error shows a mismatch between the token audience and the expected audience. This is a common issue with Workload Identity Federation configuration. I'll access the repository and provide a corrected workflow file. \n\nI see we need to modify our approach. Since direct GitHub access isn't available, I'll create a corrected workflow file that addresses the audience issue. \n\nNow let's also update the deployment workflow with the same fix: \n\n\n\nLet's create an alternative authentication workflow that uses a service account key file instead of Workload Identity Federation, which gives us a more direct authentication method: \n\n\n\nBased on the error message and my analysis, here's the path forward:\n\n## Authentication Fix Plan\n\nWe have two options to resolve the authentication issue:\n\n### Option 1: Fix Workload Identity Federation (Recommended)\n\n1. **Update the workflow files** as I've done in the artifacts above, adding:\n   - `token_format: \"access_token\"`\n   - `create_credentials_file: true`\n\n2. **Fix the audience format** in Google Cloud:\n   - This requires accessing the Workload Identity Pool configuration in GCP\n   - We need to ensure the audience format matches exactly what's expected\n\n### Option 2: Use Service Account Key Authentication (Alternative)\n\n1. **Create a service account key** in Google Cloud Console:\n   - Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts\n   - Find `github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com`\n   - Create a new key (JSON format)\n\n2. **Add the key as a GitHub Secret**:\n   - In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions\n   - Add a new repository secret named `GCP_SA_KEY`\n   - Paste the entire contents of the JSON key file\n\n3. **Use the service-account-auth.yml workflow** I've created\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **First, try the updated Workload Identity workflows**:\n   - Update both workflow files with the changes I provided\n   - Push them to GitHub\n   - Run the test-api-enablement workflow\n\n2. **If that fails, use the service account key approach**:\n   - Follow the steps above to create and add the service account key\n   - Push the service-account-auth.yml workflow to GitHub\n   - Run this workflow instead\n\nWould you like me to provide more detailed instructions for any of these steps? Or do you want to proceed with Option 1 first and see if it resolves the issue?"
