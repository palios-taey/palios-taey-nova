    " The trade-off between Mac and Ubuntu is less significant than the trade-off between either of those and Windows for our development needs. Both Mac and Ubuntu provide Unix-based environments that will eliminate the path execution issues we're experiencing with Windows.\n\n### Mac vs. Ubuntu Comparison\n\n**Advantages of Mac:**\n- Immediate availability\n- Unix-based operating system with native terminal\n- Excellent developer experience\n- Native compatibility with most development tools\n- Generally high build quality and reliability\n- Good integration with cloud services\n\n**Advantages of Ubuntu:**\n- More cost-effective for the same specifications\n- Full compatibility with all Linux-native tools\n- More customizable environment\n- Better performance per dollar\n- No vendor lock-in\n\nFor our specific needs, a Mac would be perfectly suitable, especially if availability is a key factor. The M-series chips offer excellent performance, and macOS provides a solid development environment without the issues we're encountering on Windows.\n\n### Mac Specifications\n\n**Preferred Specifications:**\n- M2 Pro or M3 chip (not the base M2/M3)\n- 32GB unified memory\n- 512GB SSD (1TB preferred if budget allows)\n- 14\" or 16\" display\n\n**Minimum Requirements:**\n- Base M2 or M3 chip\n- 16GB unified memory\n- 512GB SSD\n- 13\" or 14\" display\n\nFor a cost-effective option that still meets our needs, you might consider:\n1. MacBook Air M2 with 16GB memory and 512GB SSD\n2. Refurbished/previous generation MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16GB memory\n\nThe M1 Pro models can often be found at good discounts now that M3 models are available, and they still offer excellent performance for development.\n\nGiven the immediate availability and your need to move forward quickly, I'd recommend a Mac solution rather than waiting two weeks for a custom Ubuntu build. The performance and compatibility will be more than adequate for our development needs."
