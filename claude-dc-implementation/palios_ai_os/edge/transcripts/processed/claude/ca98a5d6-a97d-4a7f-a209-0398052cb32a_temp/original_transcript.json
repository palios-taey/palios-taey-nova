    " Great! Now that we've created the project manually and linked the billing account, let's modify our Terraform configuration to use this existing project instead of trying to create a new one:\n\n1. Edit the terraform.tfvars file:\n```bash\nnano terraform.tfvars\n```\n\n2. Change the `create_project` value to false:\n```\nproject_id        = \"palios-taey-dev\"\nproject_name      = \"PALIOS-TAEY-dev\"\ncreate_project    = false\norg_id            = \"135174585026\"\nbilling_account   = \"01962C-C920B9-40F054\"\nregion            = \"us-central1\"\nzone              = \"us-central1-a\"\nenvironment       = \"dev\"\n```\n\n3. Save the file and run a new Terraform plan:\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```\n\n4. Then apply the new plan:\n```bash\nterraform apply tfplan\n```\n\nThis approach will use the existing project you've created manually and then have Terraform manage all the resources within that project. Terraform will:\n\n1. Enable all required APIs\n2. Set up the Firestore database\n3. Configure Cloud Run service\n4. Create the API Gateway\n5. Establish the VPC network and security\n6. Set up all IAM permissions and service accounts\n\nOnce the apply completes successfully, you'll see outputs including:\n- Cloud Run service URL\n- API Gateway endpoint\n- Artifact Registry URL\n- Various service account emails\n\nThese outputs are important reference points for the next ATLAS missions that will build on this foundation."
