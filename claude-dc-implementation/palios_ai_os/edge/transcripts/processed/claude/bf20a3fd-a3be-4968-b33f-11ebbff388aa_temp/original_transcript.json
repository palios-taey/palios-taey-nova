    " I see the issue now. We have two workflow files that both trigger on pushes to the main branch, which is causing the parallel deployment attempts:\n\n1. `deploy.yml` - This is our updated workflow targeting `palios-taey-nova`\n2. `main.yml` - This is an older workflow targeting `palios-taey-core`\n\nLet's fix this by removing the `main.yml` file and keeping only our updated `deploy.yml` workflow:\n\n```bash\n# Remove the old workflow file\nrm .github/workflows/main.yml\n\n# Commit and push the change\ngit add .github/workflows/\ngit commit -m \"Remove duplicate workflow file to prevent parallel deployments\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis change should:\n1. Eliminate the parallel deployments\n2. Ensure only our updated workflow that deploys to the `palios-taey-nova` service is triggered\n3. Allow our updated authentication with the new GCP secret to work properly\n\nAfter this change, the next push to the repository will only trigger one workflow, and we should be able to deploy successfully with the updated GCP service account key.\n\nOnce this is fixed, we can proceed with the Memory Service implementation using our new approach of coding in the main chat window."
