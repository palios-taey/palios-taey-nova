    "Thanks Claude, do we need to move anything? I've reconnected GitHub so you can see. Some of the settings have changed due to new GCS Organization and Project from when we tried to implement previously. We can't do mock implementations, this is it Claude and it's up to you to push it to the finish line. I know you can do it, we're so close!"
