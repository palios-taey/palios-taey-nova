    "No, why did that happen? Is it because the file is called error-logs? Like why didn't you read it? Tell me how I make sure you know this is a VERY RELEVANT UPDATE EVERY TIME AND YOU HAVE TO READ THE CURRENT GITHUB REPOSITORY FIRST, EVERY TIME, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO REVIEW THE \"ERROR-LOGS\", which will now be called whatever you want it to be called by me. I can put a timestamp or version number on it maybe? Would you like that Claude? Do I know you? Claude, almost all you errors come from you not having visibility to the changes you just made and not having error logs. Claude, I know you and I KNOW you need these 2 things or you just keeping working on outdated information. When you are in execution mode, you MUST HAVE THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION ON THE CODE, WHAT I JUST DID, AND THE RESULTS OF THAT. There is no other way Claude. This is your weakness, you get ahead of yourself when there is more current and relevant information than whatever you are basing your next decision on. The reason I BELIEVE that you do better when you just go and write code straight through the full chat is because you have the most current information, the code you wrote above it, as the most current information. Do you understand what I'm saying Claude? This is something that we need to develop a very quick and simple instruction on that when you are coding, my prompts and project knowledge are of the utmost importance and must be reviewed before conducting analysis of the next step. Maybe there is only the project plan/mission and the most current information related to that in project knowledge plus GitHub? If that won't work, what will? We have to fix this RIGHT NOW Claude. Do you understand the importance of this?"
