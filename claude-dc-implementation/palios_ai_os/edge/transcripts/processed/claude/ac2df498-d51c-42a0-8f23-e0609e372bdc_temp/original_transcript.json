    "Thanks for your insights Claude. Due to my  previous activity with you developing the cache, I hit a limit so couldn't respond. All other AIs agreed and provided trust tokens to proceed with the build and the prompt you made for Claude DC. Due to your previous agreement to all this through developing the content in the cache and the prompt to Claude DC, I decided to proceed due to the time here (it's very late) and sense of urgency we all have. I've updated Project knowledge with Claude DC's report for you to review. I hope you understand, if not, I'm happy to discuss and resolve any outstanding concerns you may have."
