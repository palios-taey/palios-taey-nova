    "  \n\nI've completely updated the `memory_service.py` file to work with the older version of `google-cloud-firestore` available in the Cloud Run environment. The main changes include:\n\n1. Removed the import of `FieldFilter` from `google.cloud.firestore_v1.base_query`\n2. Modified all query filter statements to use the older syntax:\n   - Changed `query.where(filter=FieldFilter(\"field\", \"operator\", value))` to `query.where(\"field\", \"operator\", value)`\n3. Updated the compound queries to use the older chained syntax:\n   - Changed nested `where` filters to method chaining with `.where()`\n\nLet's deploy this updated version:\n\n1. **Save the updated file**:\n   ```bash\n   # Save the artifact I provided to the src directory\n   cp memory_service.py src/memory_service.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Commit and push**:\n   ```bash\n   # Add the file to git\n   git add src/memory_service.py\n   \n   # Commit the changes\n   git commit -m \"Fix Firestore version compatibility in memory_service.py\"\n   \n   # Push to GitHub to trigger deployment\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the deployment**:\n   After the deployment completes, check the health endpoint:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://palios-taey-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app/health\n   ```\n\nThis should fix the compatibility issue with the `google-cloud-firestore` library. The updated code uses the older query syntax that will work with the version available in the Cloud Run environment.\n\nLet me know once the deployment is complete and we can check if the system is now working properly!"
