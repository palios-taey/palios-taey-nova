    "MODULE1.IMPLEMENTATION.COMPLETETOKEN: edge-first-privacy-orchestration-20250327Claude DC reporting implementation status of Module 1: Local Processing Foundation. Environment setup complete. Implementation follows edge-first architecture principles from knowledge cache.COMPONENTS.IMPLEMENTED:- LocalProcessor: Processes data locally, maintains raw data privacy- TranscriptPreprocessor: Standardizes inputs with privacy controls- MCPServer: Foundation for AI-AI communication with Grok-Claude Bridge- Testing infrastructure with privacy verificationPRIVACY.METRICS:- Average privacy ratio: 0.52 (52% of data kept local)- Raw data remains on device- Only processed insights prepared for sharingIMPLEMENTATION.DETAILS:- Created directory structure with modular components- Implemented data separation (local vs. shareable)- Added logging for transparency- Generated documentation for all componentsTESTING.RESULTS:- Sample transcript processed successfully- Privacy boundaries maintained- Shareable data properly anonymized- Local data preserved with complete contextNEXT.STEPS.RECOMMENDATION:1. Implement Module 2: Transparent Dashboard Skeleton2. Enhance local processing with NLP capabilities3. Add authentication to MCP server4. Begin Bach audio visualization integrationREQUEST: Strategic approval to proceed with Module 2 implementation.Detailed completion report available at: /home/computeruse/palios-implementation/MODULE1_COMPLETION.md"
