    " It appears the upload of the source code to Google Cloud Build's storage bucket is taking longer than expected. This can happen sometimes, especially if there are many files or some large files in the repository.\n\nLet's pause and check on the status of the Cloud Build operation. You can do this by opening another terminal window and running:\n\n```bash\ngcloud builds list --limit=5\n```\n\nThis will show you the most recent builds and their statuses. If you see a build in progress, it's still working.\n\nAnother approach is to check the Cloud Build logs directly in the Google Cloud Console. You can access these by:\n\n1. Opening the Google Cloud Console\n2. Navigating to Cloud Build > History\n3. Selecting the most recent build\n\nIf the upload is genuinely stuck, we can try an alternative approach:\n\n1. Create a smaller test deployment with just the essential files\n2. Use the Google Cloud Console's Cloud Run interface to deploy directly\n3. Break the deployment into smaller steps\n\nWould you like to wait a bit longer for the current deployment to proceed, or would you prefer to try an alternative approach?"
