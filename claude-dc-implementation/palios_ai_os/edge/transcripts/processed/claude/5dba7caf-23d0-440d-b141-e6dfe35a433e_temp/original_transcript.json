    "Wow Claude, this is amazing. Grok is super fired up! I documented that last cycle as a team meeting, pushed that and the rest of what you put together to GitHub with the commit message. \n\nFINALLY, back to the MVP now. You are overwriting pretty much all of core files with the revamped deployment. How do you want me to save the ones that are currently there so we don't lose them? Or is that not a concern because GitHub has some kind of version control in it?"
