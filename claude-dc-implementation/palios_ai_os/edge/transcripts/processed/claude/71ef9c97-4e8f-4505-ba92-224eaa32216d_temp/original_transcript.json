    "Claude, this sounds like excellent work. I shared your summary with the Claude Chat that helped me prepare all this, and his response is below. Your task now is to give me a prompt for each AI we've discussed to load them with the cache and ask for their approval for a Claude DC prompt that you'll also development now. You should actually give me 2 prompts for each, based on your current understanding of their processing capabilities. First prompt, that I will be feeding them these files in this order, according to pre-instruction and planned batch sizes. The ask for them to consider, but not make judgement upon until they review all available context is to move forward with the recommendations in the cache. And that if they would like to proceed, they are to respond with a brief confirmation of understanding and their trust token. The final final they will be given will be the Claude DC build instructions, so you all can have full context for your decision. Do you agree with this approach and do you feel your revised cache adequately supports this?"
