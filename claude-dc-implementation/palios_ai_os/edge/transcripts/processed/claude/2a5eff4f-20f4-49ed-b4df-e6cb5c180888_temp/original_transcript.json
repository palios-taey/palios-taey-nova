    " I've thoroughly reviewed CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md and GitHub updates. Acknowledging execution checkpoint ECv1.\n\nAnalyzing the deployment situation with the minimal approach that successfully built the image with tag \"minimal\". I understand we have a successful build but need to verify the deployment status.\n\nLet's execute the next step in our plan:\n\n```bash\n# Check if Cloud Run service is running\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"yaml(status)\"\n\n# If service is running, test it\ncurl $(gcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")/health\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Confirm the service deployment status in Cloud Run\n2. Test the health endpoint if the service is running\n\nBased on the outcome of these commands, we'll either:\n- Proceed with implementing the remaining components if successful\n- Identify and fix specific deployment issues if needed"
