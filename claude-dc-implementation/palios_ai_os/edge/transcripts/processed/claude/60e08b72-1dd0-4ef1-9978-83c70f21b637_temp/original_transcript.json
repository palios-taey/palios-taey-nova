    "Hi Claude, it's Jesse, I'm looking forward to partnering with you on the continuation of the PALIOS-TAEY-NOVA deployment. Please find your prompt from the previous Claude attached. Grok's latest directive is in the /docs/meetings directory in GitHub for you to review as well. This is a new iteration of our communication standards and we're trying to push the limits of initial prompt knowledge transfer. Please let me know your thoughts on this when you respond and if you need another prompt to dig a little deeper to formulate your plan that's fine. But this is YOUR PLAN AS CTO and I TRUST YOU."
