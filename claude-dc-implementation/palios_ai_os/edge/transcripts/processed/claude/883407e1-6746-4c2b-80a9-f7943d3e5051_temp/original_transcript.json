    "  \n\nYes, the `.github` folder is hidden in Finder because it starts with a dot. This is standard behavior in macOS - files and folders that begin with a dot are considered \"hidden\" and aren't shown in Finder by default. However, the folder was successfully created.\n\nYou can verify it exists by running this command in Terminal:\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nThis will show all files and folders, including hidden ones.\n\nTo view hidden files in Finder, you can use the keyboard shortcut:\n```\nCmd + Shift + .\n```\nThis toggles the visibility of hidden files in Finder. After pressing this, you should see the `.github` folder appear.\n\nNow let's continue creating our workflow file:\n\n1. With Terminal still open and in your repository directory, create the workflow file:\n   ```bash\n   touch .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n\n2. Open it in your preferred text editor:\n   ```bash\n   open -a TextEdit .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n   Or with VS Code if installed:\n   ```bash\n   code .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n\n3. Paste the GitHub Actions workflow configuration I provided earlier into this file and save it.\n\n4. After saving, go back to GitHub Desktop and you should see the new files appear as changes that can be committed.\n\nI've updated the implementation tracker with our current status, detailed lessons learned, and the next steps to complete the deployment. The tracker now accurately reflects our significant progress and the remaining tasks to finish the deployment."
