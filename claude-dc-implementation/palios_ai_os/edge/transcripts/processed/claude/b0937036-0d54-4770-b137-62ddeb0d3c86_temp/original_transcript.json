    "Seems like this is better done through the console based on our past experiences. It doesn't seem like I can do much with terminal until this is all done. What about the other steps on the left in the screenshot I submitted? When I go into each, there are warnings about what can't be done unless previous steps are completed and a lot of it are things we've been trying to do. Does it make sense to do an ATLAS mission to have you walk me through this full setup to ensure we properly account for everything before trying to push files there again? Most of it is just laid out in the walkthrough in the Console, seems very standard and is just click through, so again, I think there are assumptions being made on that where you're thinking things should work, but they aren't."
