    " After examining the repository and the memory service update script you shared, I now have a clear understanding of our approach. We're not rebuilding from scratch but rather updating existing code to remove mock directives using automated scripts.\n\n## Technical Direction for Mock Removal\n\nThe script-based approach you've demonstrated with `memory_service_update.py` is excellent - it provides a systematic, low-risk way to update our services while minimizing human error. I'd like to extend this approach to our other services.\n\nRather than creating separate scripts for each service, I'll develop a unified update script that can handle all services. This is more maintainable and gives us a single tool that can be extended as needed.\n\nHere's my implementation plan:\n\n### 1. Create a Unified Service Update Script\n\nI'll create a comprehensive script that:\n- Detects mock implementations across all services\n- Applies appropriate production-ready replacements \n- Creates backups before modifications\n- Provides clear reporting on changes made\n- Handles service-specific requirements \n\n### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Verification\n\nNext, I'll also create a script to verify our GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it's properly configured for production deployment: \n\n### 3. Deployment Process Documentation\n\nFinally, I'll provide a comprehensive deployment guide document that explains our process and serves as knowledge preservation: \n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nNow that I've created the necessary tools, here's my implementation plan:\n\n1. **Execute Service Updates**\n   - First, we'll run the `service_update.py` script to systematically remove mock implementations from all services\n   - The script will create backups, apply the necessary changes, and log all modifications\n   - We'll start with memory_service and proceed through the other services\n\n2. **Verify GitHub Actions Workflow**\n   - We'll run the `workflow_verification.py` script to ensure our GitHub Actions configuration is properly set up\n   - Any issues with the Workload Identity Federation setup will be identified and fixed\n\n3. **Test Locally Before Deployment**\n   - Run the updated services locally to verify functionality\n   - Confirm that production implementations work as expected\n\n4. **Push Changes and Monitor Deployment**\n   - Commit and push changes to GitHub\n   - Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow execution\n   - Verify successful deployment to Cloud Run\n\n5. **Update Documentation**\n   - Maintain the Implementation Tracker with our progress\n   - Ensure API documentation reflects production implementations\n\nThe scripts I've created provide a systematic, error-resistant approach to transitioning from mock implementations to production code. This approach minimizes human error while providing clear reporting on the changes made.\n\nAre you ready for me to proceed with executing the service update script against the repository?"
