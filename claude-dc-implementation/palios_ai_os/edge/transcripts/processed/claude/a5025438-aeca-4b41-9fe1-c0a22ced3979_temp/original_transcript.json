    " Here's the PRR template using the exact format I've been given previously:\n\n# PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent\nI will implement API connections to multiple AI systems (OpenAI, Google/Gemini, Anthropic/Claude, and Grok) and properly configure Firestore for data storage. This will build upon our successful MVP deployment by replacing mock implementations with real connections while maintaining our communication protocol enhancements.\n\n## Execution Steps\n1. Set up secure API key management using Secret Manager\n2. Implement client libraries for each AI provider (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, others as appropriate)\n3. Configure Firestore connection for real data storage\n4. Update the model registry to use real capabilities from integrated models\n5. Enhance security, authentication, and monitoring\n6. Update deployment workflow for continuous integration\n\n## Important Notes\n- API keys will initially be provided in the PRR but should be transferred to Secret Manager\n- Current deployment uses mock responses that should be replaced with real implementations\n- The system should maintain protocol-awareness while integrating with real models\n- API integration should be done with proper error handling and rate limiting\n- Firestore collections should follow a consistent naming convention"
