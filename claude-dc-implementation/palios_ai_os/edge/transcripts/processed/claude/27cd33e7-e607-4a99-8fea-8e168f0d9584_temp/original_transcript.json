    " Let's remove the backend configuration in main.tf that's causing these issues:\n\n```bash\nnano main.tf\n```\n\nFind the backend configuration block and completely remove or comment it out:\n\n```terraform\n# Remove or comment out this entire block\n# backend \"gcs\" {\n#   bucket = \"palios-taey-terraform-state\"\n#   prefix = \"terraform/state\"\n# }\n```\n\nSave the file and then run the init command with the reconfigure flag:\n\n```bash\nterraform init -reconfigure\n```\n\nThis should initialize Terraform without trying to use a remote backend. Then we can run the plan:\n\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```\n\nThe references to \"backend\" in api_gateway.tf are part of the OpenAPI specification for the API Gateway and aren't related to the Terraform backend, so we can leave those as they are."
