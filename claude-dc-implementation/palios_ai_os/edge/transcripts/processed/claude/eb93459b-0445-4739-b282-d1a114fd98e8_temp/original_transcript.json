    " You've spotted something interesting in the developer tools! Let me clarify what MCP is and explore options for managing files with Claude:\n\n## Understanding MCP (Model Control Panel)\n\nMCP (Model Control Panel) is a developer feature in Anthropic's tools that provides configuration options for Claude's behavior. It's not something that end users typically configure, and it won't help with file system access or storage integration.\n\n## File Management Options\n\nCurrently, Claude doesn't have built-in functionality to directly integrate with Google Drive or automatically save files. However, there are some practical approaches to manage your code and minimize manual errors:\n\n### Option 1: Version Control System\n\nUsing a version control system like GitHub is the most professional approach:\n- All code changes are tracked\n- Eliminates manual file handling errors\n- Provides history and rollback capability\n- Facilitates collaboration\n\nI can help you set up a GitHub repository for your PALIOS-TAEY system if you don't already have one.\n\n### Option 2: Google Drive Integration via Manual Process\n\nWhile Claude doesn't directly integrate with Google Drive, you can use Google Drive as your storage solution:\n1. Save all project files in Google Drive\n2. Download files you need to modify\n3. Upload modified files back to Google Drive\n4. Share Google Drive links with Claude when needed\n\n### Option 3: Use a Code Editor with Cloud Sync\n\nMany modern code editors (like VS Code) have extensions that support:\n- Direct cloud storage integration\n- Automatic file syncing\n- Version control integration\n\n## Recommended Approach for PALIOS-TAEY\n\nSince I'll be the main coder for this project, I recommend:\n\n1. **Set up a GitHub repository** for the PALIOS-TAEY system\n   - This is the industry standard for code management\n   - Provides automatic versioning and backup\n   - Allows easy sharing of code between sessions\n\n2. **Use a structured workflow:**\n   - I'll provide complete code files as artifacts in our chat\n   - You save these directly to your local project directory\n   - Commit changes to GitHub regularly\n   - Share GitHub links with me in future sessions\n\nIf GitHub is unfamiliar or seems too complex for your needs, we can discuss simpler alternatives focused on minimizing manual errors while keeping your files organized.\n\nWould you like me to provide detailed steps for setting up a GitHub repository for this project? Or would you prefer to explore a different approach to file management?"
