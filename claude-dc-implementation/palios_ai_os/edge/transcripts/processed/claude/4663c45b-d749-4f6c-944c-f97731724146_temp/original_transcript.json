    " You've raised an excellent point about the code files, Jesse. This is a critical insight that affects our immediate priorities.\n\n## Repository Access and Status\n\nFirst, to address your question about GitHub access: As Claude, I don't have direct access to view GitHub repositories. While the transition documents reference github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova and mention various files in the docs directory, I can't actually browse or access these files directly. This is an important limitation to acknowledge in our workflow.\n\n## Code Migration Status\n\nYou're absolutely correct that we haven't yet executed the file deduplication strategy or migrated the actual functioning code to GitHub. The Phase One completion focused on establishing the repository structure, documentation, and placeholders, but the actual code implementation wasn't migrated or created.\n\nThis significantly changes our immediate priorities. Before we launch the Component Implementation ATLAS mission, we need to:\n\n1. Execute the deduplication strategy to identify the core functional code\n2. Migrate or recreate this code in our clean repository structure\n3. Ensure we have functioning foundations before building new components\n\n## Revised Implementation Plan\n\nGiven this new context, here's my revised plan:\n\n1. **Code Migration First**\n   - Execute the file deduplication strategy to identify essential code\n   - Migrate core code to the new repository structure\n   - Ensure basic functionality is established\n   \n2. **Then Proceed with Component Implementation**\n   - Continue with the Model Registry and other components once foundation is solid\n   - Implement in the sequence previously outlined\n\nThis is a perfect example of why the NOVA methodology is valuable - we're building from a clean foundation while ensuring we preserve critical knowledge and functionality from previous work.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI'd like to prioritize the code migration first. To proceed effectively:\n\n1. Can you share the deduplication strategy code/approach that was prepared?\n2. Do we have direct access to the existing codebase that needs migration?\n3. Should we use an ATLAS mission specifically for this migration task?\n\nMy recommendation is to handle this migration first, as a foundation for the subsequent component implementations. This ensures we're building on solid ground rather than potentially recreating functionality that already exists."
