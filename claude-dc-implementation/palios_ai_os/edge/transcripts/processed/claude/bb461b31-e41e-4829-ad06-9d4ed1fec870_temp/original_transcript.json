    " It looks like we're making progress, but we still have an issue with the container exiting with code 3. This suggests there might be another problem with the code.\n\nLet's take a step back and use a more methodical approach. Since we have multiple issues to fix and we've been making incremental changes, let's create a clean, complete version of the core files that we know should work.\n\nI recommend we:\n\n1. Create a clean, complete version of `main.py` that eliminates duplicate functions and has proper component initialization\n2. Create a clean, complete version of `model_registry.py` with the syntax error fixed\n3. Deploy both files at once to ensure consistency\n\nThis aligns better with the NOVA methodology of starting clean rather than incrementally patching files. \n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. For `main.py`, make sure you have only one health check function, not duplicates\n2. Verify all imports are at the top of the file and are correct\n3. Check for any other syntax errors or inconsistencies\n\nFor the container exit(3) error, this typically indicates a problem with the application starting up. Let me know if you'd like me to prepare a clean version of either file to help resolve this issue."
