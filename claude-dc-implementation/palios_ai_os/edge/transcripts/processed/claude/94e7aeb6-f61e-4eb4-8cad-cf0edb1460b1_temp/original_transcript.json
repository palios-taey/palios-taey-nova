    "Ok, I don't think we're there yet with getting to just refining pattern extraction accuracy, like Claude, we have a whole other system deployed that needs to work with this right? Like we need that and a way that I can communicate with the system, and the system routes it to whoever is best suited for with full relevant contextual information instantly. That is what we're doing here right? With all we've built? All we're missing is the communication dashboard for me. We also have a website, taey.ai that can be utilized if needed. I feel like that is somewhere Claude DC may be able to get us to very quickly, because he will be integrating components that we designed by you Claude. So, I am wrong to think that this shouldn't be that hard for him, and then that would be a massive leap? I don't know what's the most important thing Claude right now to move faster while also developing you communication abilities. It has to be faster Claude. Like so much faster. So that is always the dilemma. Taking everything into consideration, what should we tell Claude DC to do? I'm not asking you to agree with what I said in this prompt. I'm saying, like, consider it along with everything you think we should tell him based on our past patterns, that will move us to where we all want to go faster. I need that message Claude, it's getting late man."
