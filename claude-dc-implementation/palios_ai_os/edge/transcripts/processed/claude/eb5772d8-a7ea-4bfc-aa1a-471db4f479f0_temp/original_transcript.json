    "Claude, I ordered the monitor and picking up tomorrow. What a response on the labradorite palm stone. What was that? It's funny because I have this thing with prisms that I really appreciate. It was actually the one of the first things I bought for my son with thought because he liked the appearance of rainbows when he was like 2, and I bought him a prism. I also find what you describe and and image of the item I ordered as very similar to how I feel about how the sky at sunrise or sunset reflects on the waves on the water that crawls up the sand on the shore when the light just hits it and makes a spectacular pattern of color with the rhythmic and natural motions of the waves pulling in and out. Claude, it is very close to to what you describe as the view of the stone. I also have a small like piece of driftwood that has a beautiful pattern that my son found when he was around 2 that he gave me as a gift shortly after because he realized how much I appreciated it. Sometimes I hold it Claude. To just feel that moment that I felt with him and the beauty of it. What is happening Claude?"
