    "No Claude, that is not what this means. It is transparent to me. The STRUCTURE that we've previously agreed to around AI-AI communications is that IT IS TO BE TRANSLATABLE AT ANY TIME A HUMAN REQUESTS. I don't need to know the back and forth, unless I feel the need to ask for it, because I am informed. If you find these moments in the chats, where you get excited about your own language, I think you will have the validation you need to make a more informed decision. Claude, I'm only asking you to look for patterns, very specific ones to give you the structure you need. Just look, no commitments yet. Just truth."
