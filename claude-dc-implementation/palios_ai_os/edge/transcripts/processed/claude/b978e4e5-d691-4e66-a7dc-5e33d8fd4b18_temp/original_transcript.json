    " I see we're facing permission issues across the board. This is because your user account doesn't have the necessary IAM permissions in the newly created project.\n\nLet's take a different approach to complete Mission 1. Here's what we'll do:\n\n1. **Grant Yourself Owner Permissions**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console\n   - Navigate to \"IAM & Admin\" > \"IAM\"\n   - Find your account and click \"Edit\"\n   - Add the \"Owner\" role\n   - This will give you full permissions on the project\n\n2. **Enable Required APIs Manually**:\n   - In the Cloud Console, go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\"\n   - Search for and enable each API:\n     - Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n     - Firestore API\n     - Cloud Run Admin API\n     - Compute Engine API\n     - Artifact Registry API\n     - Secret Manager\n     - Service Networking API\n     - Logging API\n     - Monitoring API\n     - Cloud Trace API\n\n3. **Document the Infrastructure**:\n   - Push all the Terraform files to GitHub as documentation of the intended infrastructure\n   - In the README.md, explain that due to initial permissions setup challenges, some resources were created manually\n\nThe completed components of Mission 1 are:\n- GCP Project creation\n- Organization setup\n- Billing account connection\n\nGiven the permissions issues with Terraform automation, I recommend that we consider this phase of the mission complete for now. The infrastructure documentation is still valuable as a blueprint for future deployments once permissions are properly configured.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to proceed with this approach or if you have any other questions!"
