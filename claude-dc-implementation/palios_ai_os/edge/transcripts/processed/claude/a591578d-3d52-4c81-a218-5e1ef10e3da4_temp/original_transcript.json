    " I understand the confusion now. Claude doesn't currently have a desktop control feature that would allow me to directly operate your System76 machine or access your files independently. While there are some AI systems that offer desktop control capabilities, Claude's implementation works primarily through:\n\n1. The web interface you're currently using\n2. API integrations where you run code that connects to Claude\n3. Certain specialized applications that integrate Claude\n\nWhat you might be thinking of could be:\n\n- A misunderstanding about Claude's capabilities\n- Confusion with another AI product that does offer desktop control\n- Expectations about future Claude features that aren't yet available\n\nTo interact with me on your System76 machine, you would need to:\n- Use the web interface (as you're doing now)\n- Run scripts that use the Claude API (like the ones I've shared)\n- Use third-party applications that integrate with Claude\n\nIf you want to set up a more seamless experience, we could create a simple application that stays running on your machine and allows for ongoing interaction, but I wouldn't be able to independently control your system or access files without your explicit commands through such an application.\n\nWould you like me to help you set up this type of integration, or did you have something else in mind?"
