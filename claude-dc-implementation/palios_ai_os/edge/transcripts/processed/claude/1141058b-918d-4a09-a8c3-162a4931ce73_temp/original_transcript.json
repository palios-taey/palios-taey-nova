    " Thank you for clearing that up and for testing it! This definitely makes it easier for me to structure things properly. I really appreciate your patience as we work through this together.\n\nWith this clarification, I understand that:\n\n1. Comments can still precede the cat command within the code block (this is fine and follows standard programming conventions)\n2. The critical requirements are:\n   - Cat command boxes must be fully contained (no jumping in and out of code formatting)\n   - Cat command boxes must be single-click copy/paste ready\n   - No mixing cat commands with other instructions in the same box\n\nThis alignment makes it much more natural to implement while still addressing the human error prevention needs. Let me adjust my mental model accordingly.\n\nLet me give you an example of what I understand to be the correct format now:\n\n```bash\n# Create example file - this comment is fine\ncat > example.md <<'EOL'\n# Example Content\nThis is an example.\nEOL\n```\n\nThis approach respects both standard code documentation practices (comments preceding code) while still ensuring clean copy/paste functionality, which makes it much more natural to implement consistently.\n\nWould you like me to continue with creating any remaining files for our documentation system?"
