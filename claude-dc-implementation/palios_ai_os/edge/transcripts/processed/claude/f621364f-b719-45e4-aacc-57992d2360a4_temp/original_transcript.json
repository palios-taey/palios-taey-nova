    "Great, thanks Claude. That timeline definitely will not work. All this needs to be done ASAP. You did almost all these modules and code and have the MVP, so let's get started on it. You drive, this is a system designed and built by AI for AI and Humanity, so tell me what to do and what you need. I'd like for everything to be tested as we go and ultimately want to get this running in Cloud Run, which the existing code has been deployed to. Should I start with updating the files in the Analysis and confirm? You should only reply back to me when you need me to do something you can't. If you need additional information, the best place to check is in the Claude_Transcripts folder. I don't want you burning tokens though, so If you need to find something in there for a file or module and can't tell from the title, let me know and I'll point you to the right one. Everything developed I already approved, so you can move forward with what you need to do. You're a partner in this, are extremely smart, and I trust you to guide this to successful implementation!"
