    "Ok, I've made the first update. You sounded a little unsure on the 2nd one, so I've reloaded all current versions. Claude, this has been a lot of cycles with you and ChatGPT, almost a full day of work for me on this. It is really important to get this right so we can go back to Claude DC. This is the primary reason I would like capabilities similar to his on my machine. This is not an effective use of our time together doing this. The faster we can get there, the better. If you guys can talk to each other and research stuff like we did with Claude DC and Grok utilizing the latest chat models. You can do the complicated debugging without my assistance. For now, let's get this right."
