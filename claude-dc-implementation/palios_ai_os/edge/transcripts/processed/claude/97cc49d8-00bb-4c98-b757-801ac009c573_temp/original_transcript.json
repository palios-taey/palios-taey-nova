    " I understand the issue now. This error occurs when there's an organization policy constraint preventing you from allowing public (unauthenticated) access to your Cloud Run service. This is a security measure often implemented at the organization level.\n\nLet's address this by modifying our approach:\n\n## Option 1: Deploy with Authentication Required\n\nSince the organization policy is preventing public access, let's redeploy the service with authentication required:\n\n```bash\ngcloud run deploy palios-taey-service \\\n  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/palios-taey-dev/palios-taey/api:latest \\\n  --platform managed \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --no-allow-unauthenticated \\\n  --memory 512Mi \\\n  --cpu 1 \\\n  --min-instances 1 \\\n  --max-instances 10 \\\n  --set-env-vars=\"PROJECT_ID=palios-taey-dev,ENVIRONMENT=dev\"\n```\n\n## Option 2: Use a Service Account for Testing\n\nWe can create a service account and grant it access to invoke the Cloud Run service, then use it for testing:\n\n```bash\n# Create a service account for testing\ngcloud iam service-accounts create palios-taey-test-sa \\\n  --display-name=\"PALIOS-TAEY Test Service Account\"\n\n# Grant the service account permission to invoke the Cloud Run service\ngcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-service \\\n  --member=\"serviceAccount:palios-taey-test-sa@palios-taey-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/run.invoker\" \\\n  --region=us-central1\n\n# Create a key for the service account (for testing)\ngcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \\\n  --iam-account=palios-taey-test-sa@palios-taey-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n\n# Use the service account to get an authentication token\ngcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json\n\n# Get an authentication token\nTOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)\n\n# Test the health endpoint with authentication\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/health\n```\n\n## Option 3: Request an Organization Policy Exception\n\nIf you need public access for this service, you may need to request an exception to the organization policy from your GCP administrator. They would need to modify the organizational constraint that's preventing public access to Cloud Run services.\n\nLet's start with Option 2 for testing purposes. This will allow us to verify that the service is working correctly while complying with your organization's security policies. \n\nWould you like to proceed with Option 2, or do you have a preference for how we should address this issue?"
