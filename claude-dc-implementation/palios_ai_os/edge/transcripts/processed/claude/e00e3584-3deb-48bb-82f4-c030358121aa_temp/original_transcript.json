    "Ok, I did the environmental variables. Yes, but let's make sure we are doing this in a way that minimizes my manual effort, not just now, but going forward.

I don't know if that made sense or not, but yes, let's go with what you say is next. We have a bunch of collections set up in the Firestore db from previous builds and efforts. I'm sure it is all completely irrelevant now. API keys were stored there, but I think you came up with something else for that."
