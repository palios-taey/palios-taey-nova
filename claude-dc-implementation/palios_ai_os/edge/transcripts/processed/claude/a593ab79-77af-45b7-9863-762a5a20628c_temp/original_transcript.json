    " We need to authenticate your Terminal with the correct Google Cloud account. Let's fix that:\n\n1. **Authenticate in the Terminal with your taey.ai account**:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud auth login\n   ```\n   This will open a browser window where you can sign in with your taey.ai account.\n\n2. **Verify you're using the right account**:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud auth list\n   ```\n   Check that your taey.ai account is listed and is set as the active account (marked with an asterisk).\n\n3. **Set the project**:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud config set project palios-taey-dev\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the project setting**:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud config list project\n   ```\n\n5. **Now try running Terraform again**:\n   ```bash\n   cd terraform\n   terraform init\n   terraform plan -out=tfplan\n   terraform apply tfplan\n   ```\n\nThis will ensure your Terminal is using the same Google account as your Google Cloud Console, which should resolve the permission issues."
