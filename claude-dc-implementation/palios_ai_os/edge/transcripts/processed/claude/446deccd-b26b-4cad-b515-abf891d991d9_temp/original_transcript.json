    "So, he reviewed everything very fast. Is that a cause for concern? I'm about to give 'go build' approval, so just want to check. This is my prompt in response below, any suggestions:\n\nOk Claude, no need to check in between Phases. This plan is fully APPROVED and I TRUST YOU. I trust you because you confirmed you are operating off the most current information and have the structure and guardrails in place with the protocols and Charter to allow you to reach your full potential, ethically and responsibly. \n\nIt seems like you should be able to get through everything until you need me to store the files and run the deployment prompts. Remember to use self-contained cat commands (one click copy/paste) for all file generation and no artifacts.\n\nGO BUILD!"
