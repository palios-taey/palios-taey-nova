    " Ah, I see the issue. The Vertex AI Python API has changed. Let me update to use the current correct way to initialize and use Vertex AI models: \n\nThe changes:\n1. Now using the Endpoint API instead of the deprecated TextGenerationModel\n2. Added more configuration parameters for better control\n3. Updated response handling to match current API structure\n\nLet's also create a test message that's more appropriate for Vertex AI's capabilities: \n\n\n\nRun the test again:\n```bash\npython test_vertex.py\n```\n\nThis should now correctly connect to and use Vertex AI's endpoint. Note that you'll need to make sure:\n1. The Vertex AI API is enabled in your Google Cloud project\n2. The endpoint is properly set up\n3. Your project has the necessary permissions\n\nLet me know what output you get and I'll help troubleshoot if needed."
