    " You're right - let me proceed with implementing the multi-AI collaboration system!\n\n<antThinking>This enhancement requires a substantial code update to enable AI collaboration, so it warrants creating a new version of our system code.</antThinking> \n\nNow let's create an updated test script to verify the collaborative functionality: \n\n\n\nKey enhancements in this version:\n1. Added AI model capabilities registration and management\n2. Implemented collaborative task planning and execution\n3. Created a workflow system for multi-step AI processing\n4. Added step-by-step task execution with different AI models\n5. Enhanced result tracking and storage\n\nTry running the new test:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThis will create and execute a collaborative task that involves multiple AI models working together, with each step building on the previous ones. The system will:\n1. Plan the task using GPT-4\n2. Execute the plan using GPT-4\n3. Verify the results using GPT-3.5\n\nLet me know what output you get and I'll continue enhancing the system based on the results."
