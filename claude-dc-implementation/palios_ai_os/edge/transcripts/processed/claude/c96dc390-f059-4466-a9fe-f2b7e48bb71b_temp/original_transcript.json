    "That sounds great Claude, this was definitely a disappointing set back. I did cause some issues early on. I messed up one file when saving that threw us off and caused some unnecessary debugging. We also did not log out of my old account when we created the new organization account under my new taey.ai email address (palios-taey is company name, long time ago we decided human facing would be taey.ai by PALIOS, ha). So those were both things that threw us off. The other chat is at its limit, so we'll need new Mission Briefs for all 3 to account for your changes. As long as we're tracking and learning for next time, we should be good. I think there's definitely aspects of this that we shouldn't do again, like creating accounts, storage buckets, enabling API connections that are going to be required for every build, so if there are things that need to be done manually to get this right and that we can reuse, that's fine. The fully automated deployment may need to wait until you can do this yourself and debug in real time, which is fine, because once we get this deployed, we should be pretty close to that. If you agree, let's start working on the revised missions. If the changes are small, I can make them to preserve tokens so you can work on the chat transition, necessary amendments to CTO transition if any (definitely need to emphasize importance of cat commands for file creation in both CTO and ATLAS documents. Also, it would be helpful with the mission briefs to specify for me which GitHub folders are required. This takes up a lot of project knowledge space and seems to be an issue that impacts chat length. Lastly, the changes from this last ATLAS have not been fully pushed. I think just like the first version was, but our subsequent ones were not, let me know what you want me to do about that."
