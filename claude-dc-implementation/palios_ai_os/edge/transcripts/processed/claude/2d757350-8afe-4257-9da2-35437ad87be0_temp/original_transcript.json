    " That error indicates we have a permission issue with the Cloud Run service. Let's fix this by making the Cloud Run service publicly accessible:\n\n```bash\n# Make the Cloud Run service publicly accessible\ngcloud run services set-iam-policy palios-taey-service --region=us-central1 policy.yaml\n```\n\nFirst, create a policy.yaml file:\n\n```bash\ncat > policy.yaml <<EOF\nbindings:\n- members:\n  - allUsers\n  role: roles/run.invoker\nEOF\n```\n\nOr you can use this simpler command which directly adds the invoker role to all users:\n\n```bash\ngcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-service \\\n  --region=us-central1 \\\n  --member=\"allUsers\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/run.invoker\"\n```\n\nThis will allow unauthenticated access to your Cloud Run service, which is appropriate for a dashboard that you want to access without authentication for development purposes.\n\nAfter running this command, try accessing the URL again, and it should work. If you're still having issues, it may be worth checking the logs to see if there are any errors in the application itself:\n\n```bash\ngcloud logging read \"resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=palios-taey-service\" --limit=10\n```\n\nLet me know if this resolves the issue!"
