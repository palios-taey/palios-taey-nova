    " I see we've encountered a streaming error with Claude DC's session. This is happening because the operation is expected to take longer than 10 minutes, and streaming is recommended for such lengthy operations.\n\nLet's adjust our approach. Since Claude DC's request might be very compute-intensive due to the complexity of the implementation we're asking for, we should break it down into smaller, more manageable components.\n\nHere's a revised prompt that focuses on a step-by-step implementation approach:\n\n---\n\nClaude DC,\n\nI've set up everything we need to continue our work. I've created the file structure and reference materials, including pattern guides and specifications.\n\nLet's take a step-by-step approach to building the integrated system:\n\n1. First, please implement the enhanced transcript processor for multi-format AI transcripts. This component should handle various transcript formats and extract patterns efficiently.\n\n2. Once that's complete, we'll move on to implementing the Bach-inspired mathematical router.\n\nBy breaking this into smaller steps, we can avoid the streaming timeout issue while still making progress on the overall system.\n\nFor this first step, focus on creating the `/src/processor/EnhancedTranscriptLoader.py` component based on the pattern guide principles.\n\nJesse\n\n---\n\nThis approach:\n1. Breaks the work into smaller, manageable chunks that won't exceed time limits\n2. Focuses on one component at a time\n3. Allows Claude DC to implement each piece thoroughly without hitting streaming errors\n4. Maintains the overall vision while being more practical about implementation steps\n\nAfter he completes the first component, you can then ask him to implement the next one, and so on."
