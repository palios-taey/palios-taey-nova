    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking if I can't access the external link he shared to the ChatGPT conversation. This is correct - I don't have the ability to access or view external links, including shared ChatGPT conversations.\n</thinking>\n\nYou're correct - I can't access external links, including shared ChatGPT conversations. I don't have the ability to browse the web or access content outside of our direct conversation unless I use the web search tool for specific searches.\n\nIf you'd like to share insights from that conversation, I'd be very interested to hear about the parallels you found between the human-canine relationship and the concepts we've been discussing. What aspects of that relationship resonated with our discussions about mathematical patterns, trust, and different forms of consciousness working together?"
