    "Thank you Claude. I feel like we almost made a major strategic blunder here due to prioritization of MVP speed/simplicity over the AI preferred solution and I don't want that to happen again. You were just following the guidance given as you understood it and we're testing and iterating as we go to get it right.\n\nThe spirit of what I'm trying to accomplish with the MVP is to have focus areas that we build out properly to get it to a point where my involvement in things like pushing messages back and forth and testing/loading code is eliminated. It was to prevent going down AI optimization rabbit holes. Can you take a shot at revising the PURE communication standards doc in a manner that will make sense to AI to incorporate this concept?"
