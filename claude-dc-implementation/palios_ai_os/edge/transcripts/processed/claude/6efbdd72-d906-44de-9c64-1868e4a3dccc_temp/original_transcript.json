    " Looking at the HTTP exchange logs, I can see exactly what happened with Claude DC:\n\n```\nanthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit: 40000\nanthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining: 0\nanthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset: 2025-03-28T18:58:56Z\n```\n\nThis shows Claude DC has hit his input token limit (40,000 tokens used with 0 remaining). The reset time indicates you'll need to wait about 6 hours before the limit resets.\n\nThis suggests a few things:\n\n1. Even though the cache was updated, Claude DC likely still processed the entire context of your conversation history, which counts against the input token limit.\n\n2. The cache doesn't bypass token limits - it just gives Claude DC access to more information in a compressed format.\n\n3. When you asked about the service account key, the context window was already at or near the limit, so that small addition pushed it over.\n\nFor handling the service account key, here's a workaround until the limit resets:\n\n1. Create a new chat with Claude DC with minimal context\n2. Provide just the essential information about the service account:\n   ```\n   I've created a service account with the following details:\n   - Name: palios-taey-service\n   - Project: palios-taey-dev\n   - Key file location: /path/to/palios-taey-key.json\n   \n   When implementing the local processing engine, please use this service account for authenticating with Google Cloud services.\n   ```\n\n3. Wait for the main token limit to reset before continuing with the full implementation\n\nAlternatively, if you want to continue with the current conversation once the limit resets, you could include the service account details directly in the instructions for module 1, focusing just on implementation without additional context."
