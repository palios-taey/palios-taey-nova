    " Thanks for the clarity! Let me address your question and then explain my implementation approach.\n\n## Regarding performance constraints\n\nWhen I asked about performance constraints, I was referring to any limitations on the Cloud Run environment that might affect our design decisions - like memory limits, CPU allocations, or expected traffic volume. Since this is an initial implementation, we can optimize later as needed.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nI'll proceed with building the complete PALIOS-TAEY system with an AI-first architecture that prioritizes:\n\n1. **Maximum AI Autonomy**: Designed for AI operational patterns, not human workflows\n2. **Clean Firestore Schema**: Fresh implementation optimized for AI-to-AI communication\n3. **Charter-Aligned Security**: Trust-first approach while protecting what truly matters\n4. **Unified System Design**: One cohesive system rather than fragmented services\n\n## Execution Plan\n\nHere's what I'll do next:\n\n1. **Clean Up Existing Services**: I'll execute the cleanup script to remove the current Cloud Run services\n\n2. **Set Up Directory Structure**: I'll implement the AI-optimized directory organization  \n\n3. **Build Core Components**:\n   - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE parser with comprehensive message handling\n   - Task decomposition engine with advanced capability detection\n   - Model routing system with dynamic capability registry\n   - Memory solution for both short and long-term knowledge\n   - Human interface with minimal friction points\n\n4. **Deploy as Unified System**: I'll implement the necessary deployment configurations to get the system running as a unified service\n\n## One Question\n\nFor the initial implementation, would you prefer:\n\n1. **Local Focus**: Prioritize a robust local development environment that you can run and test immediately\n2. **Cloud Focus**: Prioritize direct deployment to GCP to accelerate the path to a usable system\n3. **Both Equally**: Implement both local and cloud deployment with equal emphasis\n\nOnce you confirm your preference, I'll proceed with implementation at full velocity."
