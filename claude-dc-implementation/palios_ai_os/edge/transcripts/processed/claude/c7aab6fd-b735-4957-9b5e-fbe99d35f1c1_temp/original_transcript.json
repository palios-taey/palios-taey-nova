    " Great news! Your Gemini API integration is now working successfully. The logs show:\n\n1. **Successful Model Discovery**:\n   - The system found 15 models supporting `generateContent`\n   - It automatically tested them in order\n   - It successfully connected to `gemini-1.5-pro-001`\n\n2. **Successful API Calls**:\n   - The `/list_models` endpoint returns all available models\n   - The `/execute_gemini` endpoint successfully generates text from the Gemini API\n   - The response includes both the text response and the full API response with metadata\n\n3. **Smooth Error Handling**:\n   - The system properly skipped models that returned 404 errors\n   - It continued testing until it found a working model\n\nThis is exactly what we wanted to achieve! The system now has a robust, self-discovering Gemini API client that can adapt to changes in Google's model lineup without requiring code changes.\n\nYour AI-to-AI system now has:\n\n1. **Resilience** - Automatically finds working models\n2. **Adaptability** - Works with whatever models are available\n3. **Self-healing** - Can recover from API errors by trying alternative models\n4. **Transparency** - Provides detailed logging and response information\n\nThis implementation aligns perfectly with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter principles:\n- It demonstrates **Continuous Learning & Adaptive Refinement** through its ability to discover and adapt to available models\n- It embodies **Resource Optimization** by automatically selecting appropriate models\n- It supports **Data-Driven Truth & Real-Time Grounding** by working with the latest model data\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to enhance or improve about the integration? For example, we could add support for additional Gemini features like multi-turn conversations or file analysis capabilities."
