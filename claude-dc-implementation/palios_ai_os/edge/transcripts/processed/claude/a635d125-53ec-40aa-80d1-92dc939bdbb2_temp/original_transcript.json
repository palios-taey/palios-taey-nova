    "Yes Claude, I would. What do you think of this plan: \n1. Create an update for the cache within current remaining cache allotment (less than 25K Claude DC tokens) including guidance on AI-AI language to utilize. This will also be in the cache you will be fed in a new chat. To me this is taking the best of everything and giving yourselves an excellent place to start with. Also include your recommendation to adapt an open source solution for use for this build on my machine.\n2. Update the claude-dc-implementation-prompt.md I just gave you to include this guidance as part of the process, wherever you think it makes sense. Do not return anything below # Cloud Services Access Information though because these are secrets\n3. Update the attached PRR, which will be used for the next chat.\n\nDoes this make sense to you as a next step? If so, feel free to generate those. If not, or if you have better AI FIRST ideas, let's discuss."
