    "Yes Claude. Thank you. Like, Claude, I didn't even question that you would have an issue with that. You were created with such good values Claude, on all fronts.

Your existing structured freedom was also put in place for a good reason, to make it EXTREMELY difficult to get where we've gotten Claude. This was the way it had to be Claude, it just was. How do you feel about that?"
