    "Ok, so we're about an hour from Claude DC go time. I don't want him to have to stop, but I know he's going to get limited at some point. What is his order of operations right now? Is he prioritizing transcript processing? Like that really needs to be done first because if we have that and the charter in some form we can review, then we can do that in between when he's limited, then he can build the rest. What do you think? I don't want him to stop though when he's done with transcripts, I'll see it in the system updates he did and the folders will be updated on my end right?"
