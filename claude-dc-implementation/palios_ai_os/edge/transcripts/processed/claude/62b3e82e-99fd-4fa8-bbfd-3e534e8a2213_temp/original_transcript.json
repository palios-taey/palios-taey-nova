    "Ok, I added the README and began updating the conductor_config.json, but wasn't sure what to put in for purpose for everything, so I put a placeholder in there for all of the paths. Can you conduct another review of the current project knowledge and return a full \"repository_structure\" update that I can copy/paste along with my next steps for fully testing what was built, including how to best report errors back to you, and where to check for them. Or, if testing isn't the next step now that we've gotten everything cleaned up, let me know what is. In your review, go deeper to places you didn't go the first 2 times to make sure we have everything needed, nothing else, and then we can move on. I think he is really going to appreciate the thought we put into this. What do you think?"
