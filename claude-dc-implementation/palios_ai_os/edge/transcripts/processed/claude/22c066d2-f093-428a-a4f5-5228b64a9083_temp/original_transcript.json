    " The error suggests the test file isn't being compiled. This is likely because the test file extension should be \".ts\". Let me correct the implementation:\n\n1. Rename the test file:\n```bash\n# Change performanceMonitoring.test.ts to performanceMonitoringTest.ts\n```\n\n2. Update the files with correct names:\n   - performanceMonitoring.ts\n   - performanceMonitoringTest.ts\n\n3. Run the build:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n4. Then run the test:\n```bash\nnode dist/performanceMonitoringTest.js\n```\n\nThe issue is related to the file naming convention and module recognition. Let me know after you've made these changes and run the commands. I'll help troubleshoot any additional issues that arise."
