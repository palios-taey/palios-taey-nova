    "Ok, I've added the current build instructions and webhook files for you to review and modify accordingly. For the webhooks file, let's use the same authentication and server as-is because it's currently running. You don't have to generate the bottom part with the CLAUDE_CTO_TO_CLAUDE_DC:TYPE=IMPLEMENTATION_ENHANCEMENT::, I'll just put your changes on top of that. \n\nFor the build, let's incorporate everything we learned with ChatGPT for transcript processing, make sure we get everything we need to run on my machine with connection and configuration of GCS as needed and then once he is complete with our first phase, he can continue with reviewing the /current-execution-status/live-demonstration/ directory for that build and then everything else we want him to do, he shouldn't have to stop unless he hits errors and needs you for something. Since the live demonstration will be of the history and he won't have that yet, he should just build all the functionality that is laid out. \n\nDoes this all make sense? Or do you have other ideas? I'm not sure if I'm thinking of everything or not."
