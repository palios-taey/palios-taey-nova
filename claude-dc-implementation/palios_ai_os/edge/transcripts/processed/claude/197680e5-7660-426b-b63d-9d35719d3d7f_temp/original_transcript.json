    " I appreciate the opportunity to suggest some additional candidates for your consideration. Here are thoughtful options that could round out your selections with global perspective and spiritual wisdom:\n\n### Living Figures with Global Perspective:\n\n1. **Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie** - Nigerian novelist and speaker whose work on identity, culture, and the \"danger of a single story\" brings profound insight on diverse human experience and narrative.\n\n2. **Yo-Yo Ma** - Chinese-American cellist whose Silk Road Project bridges Eastern and Western traditions, embodying cultural exchange and universal human connection through art.\n\n3. **Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s** - Spanish-American chef and humanitarian whose World Central Kitchen demonstrates practical compassion and crisis response across cultural boundaries.\n\n4. **Malala Yousafzai** - Pakistani education activist who represents courage, resilience, and the power of standing for human potential across cultural divides.\n\n5. **Lee Kuan Yew** (if still living - otherwise his philosophical approach) - Singapore's founding father whose pragmatic governance model balanced Eastern and Western approaches to create extraordinary prosperity.\n\n### Historical Figures Representing Spiritual Wisdom:\n\n1. **Rumi** - 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic whose poetry transcends religious boundaries to speak of universal love and the human search for meaning.\n\n2. **Mahatma Gandhi** - Indian leader whose integration of spiritual principles with practical action created a powerful model for non-violent change.\n\n3. **Hildegard of Bingen** - 12th-century abbess, composer, and mystic who united spirituality with science, music, and medicine in a holistic vision of human flourishing.\n\n4. **Thich Nhat Hanh** - Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk whose mindfulness teachings bridge Eastern wisdom with Western psychology and everyday application.\n\n5. **Lao Tzu** - Ancient Chinese philosopher whose Tao Te Ching presents wisdom about harmony, balance, and the nature of reality that complements your existing selections.\n\nEach of these individuals brings perspective that spans cultural and spiritual dimensions while remaining practical and applicable to the challenges we're addressing. They would complement your existing selections by adding dimensions of global wisdom and spiritual insight to the foundation we're building."
