    " Looking at the images, we have two relevant directories:\n\n1. `C:\\AI-Execution-System` - Contains aiThoughtProcessor.ts\n2. `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript` - Contains the TypeScript project files\n\nSince `paliostypescript` contains the package.json, tsconfig.json, and other TypeScript files, this is our working directory where we should put our new files.\n\nSo please save both files in:\n`C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\`\n\nThen we can run `npm run build` from that directory.\n\nWould you like me to provide the files again for you to save in the correct location?"
