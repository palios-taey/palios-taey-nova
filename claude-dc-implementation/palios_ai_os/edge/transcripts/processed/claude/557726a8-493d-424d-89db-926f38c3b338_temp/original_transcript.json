    "Ok, so here's what happened and what is going on. I'm on my MacBook now, because my System76 machine completely froze and is unresponsive. I can't even move the mouse, I don't know why, it just happened as you were completing your last response. Is there a way to retain my session on the System76 machine so I don't have to start over with Claude DC?"
