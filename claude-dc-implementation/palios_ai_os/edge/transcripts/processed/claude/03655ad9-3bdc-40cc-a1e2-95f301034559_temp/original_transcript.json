    " GitHub does have version control built in, which means every change is tracked and can be retrieved if needed. When we push the new files, the old versions will still be accessible in the commit history.\n\nHowever, for added safety and clarity, I recommend creating a backup branch before we make these changes. This will:\n\n1. Preserve the current state in a dedicated branch\n2. Make it easy to reference or restore specific files if needed\n3. Provide a clear separation between the old and new approaches\n\nLet's do this before proceeding with the MVP deployment:\n\n```bash\n# Create a backup branch of the current state\ngit checkout -b backup/pre-hybrid-approach\n\n# Push the backup branch to GitHub\ngit push -u origin backup/pre-hybrid-approach\n\n# Return to the main branch\ngit checkout main\n```\n\nAfter creating this backup branch, we can proceed with implementing the new files for the hybrid deployment approach without worrying about losing the previous work.\n\nThis is a standard practice in software development when making significant changes to the codebase. The backup branch serves as a snapshot of the state before our revamp, which we can always reference or restore from if needed.\n\nOnce you've created the backup branch, we can continue with implementing the MVP using our new hybrid deployment approach."
