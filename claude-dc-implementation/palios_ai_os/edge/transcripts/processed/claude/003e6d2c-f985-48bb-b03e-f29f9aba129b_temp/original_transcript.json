    " I'll help you deploy the AI Execution System to Google Cloud based on the information provided in the documents. Looking at your files, I can see this is part of the Milestone 2 focus from your MVP Action Plan Summary, specifically Project 2.1 for GCP App Engine/Cloud Run deployment.\n\nLet me design a comprehensive deployment plan for your AI system backend based on the documents you've shared:\n\n# GCP App Engine/Cloud Run Deployment Plan\n\n## 1. Project Assessment\n\nYour project appears to be a Python-based AI system with the following components:\n- Backend service (`ai-system-backend-v2`)\n- Firestore database integration\n- Various AI service integrations (OpenAI, Google Vertex AI)\n- Request handling and task management\n\nKey files I've identified:\n- `main.py` - Main application entrypoint\n- `updated_handler.py` - Core request handling\n- API service integrations, including `gemini_integration.py`\n- Configuration handling with `config_loader.py`\n- Rate limiting with `rate_limiter.py`\n\n## 2. Deployment Strategy\n\nBased on your requirements for a minimal, fast deployment for MVP Day 1, I recommend **Cloud Run** for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Flexibility**: Cloud Run supports containerized applications with fewer constraints than App Engine\n2. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand (including scaling to zero)\n3. **Cost-effectiveness**: You only pay for actual usage\n4. **Simplicity**: Straightforward deployment process\n\n## 3. Deployment Steps\n\nLet's create the deployment files and scripts: "
