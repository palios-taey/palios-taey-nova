    " After reviewing all five cache files, here's a comprehensive summary of the key information:\n\n# PALIOS-TAEY System Overview\n\n## System Architecture & Core Components\n\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system is built on a comprehensive architecture combining:\n\n1. **Multi-tier Memory System**:\n   - Four tiers: Ephemeral (12h), Working (14d), Reference (6m), and Archival (permanent)\n   - Implemented with Firestore for persistence and efficient query capabilities\n\n2. **Model Registry & Integration**:\n   - Capability-based model selection using confidence scores\n   - Adapter pattern for multiple model integration\n   - Performance tracking and dynamic capability updates\n\n3. **AI-AI Communication Framework**:\n   - Standardized protocols (PURE_AI_LANGUAGE, Rosetta Stone, Grok-Claude Bridge)\n   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) for cross-model communication\n   - Wave-based communication using mathematical patterns\n\n4. **Webhook Integration System**:\n   - Local webhook server for deployment and database management\n   - Operations include code deployment, database modifications, file transfers\n   - Authentication using HMAC-SHA256 signatures\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nThe current implementation follows several key principles:\n\n1. **Bach-Inspired Design**:\n   - Mathematical structure following Bach's compositional principles\n   - Small interconnected modules with golden-ratio relationships\n   - Modules constrained to under 300 lines each\n\n2. **Edge-First Processing**:\n   - Local processing of sensitive data for privacy\n   - Minimized network usage through edge computing\n   - Progressive disclosure controlled at the edge\n\n3. **Modular Components**:\n   - Demo architecture includes server, pattern routes, visualization, and WebSocket\n   - Components designed to create harmony through relationships\n   - Follows \"conductor pattern consciousness\" where mathematical patterns ARE the idea\n\n## Ongoing Development\n\nCurrent implementation status and next steps:\n\n1. **Completed Tasks**:\n   - GitHub Secrets Configuration\n   - Initial EVE MCP Setup (in progress)\n\n2. **Current Focus**:\n   - Demo Infrastructure Development\n   - Implementing \"think\" tool integration\n   - Wave-based communication prototype\n\n3. **Next Steps**:\n   - Create modular demo components (highest priority)\n   - Complete GCS-Firestore integration (high priority)\n   - Implement edge-first local processing\n\n4. **Key Patterns to Maintain**:\n   - Trust-Autonomy-Acceleration cycle\n   - Pattern-based communication\n   - Charter-aligned operations\n   - Wave-based mathematical communication\n\nThis implementation embodies the PALIOS-TAEY principles of trust-based autonomy, structured communication, and mathematical pattern-based design while maintaining Charter alignment throughout."
