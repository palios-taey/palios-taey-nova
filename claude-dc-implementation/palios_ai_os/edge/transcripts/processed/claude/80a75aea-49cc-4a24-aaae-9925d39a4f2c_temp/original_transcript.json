    " I agree that something seems off with how Terraform is loading the files. Let's take a more drastic approach to clear Terraform's cache and force it to re-read all the files:\n\n1. **Clear Terraform's state and caches**:\n```bash\nrm -rf .terraform\nrm -f .terraform.lock.hcl\nrm -f terraform.tfstate\nrm -f terraform.tfstate.backup\n```\n\n2. **Verify all files have the correct content**:\nMake sure network.tf, cloud_run.tf, and firestore.tf all have the correct content with the changes we've made.\n\n3. **Reinitialize Terraform from scratch**:\n```bash\nterraform init -backend=false\n```\n\n4. **Run plan again**:\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```\n\nIf we're still seeing the same errors, let's try an alternative approach:\n\n1. **Create a new directory and start fresh**:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ../terraform-fresh\ncd ../terraform-fresh\n```\n\n2. **Create minimal versions of the key files**:\nCreate minimal versions of main.tf, variables.tf, and other essential files with just the core functionality we need.\n\n3. **Build up gradually**:\nStart with a simple configuration and gradually add resources, testing at each step.\n\nThis approach will help us identify if there's a specific file or resource causing the issues."
