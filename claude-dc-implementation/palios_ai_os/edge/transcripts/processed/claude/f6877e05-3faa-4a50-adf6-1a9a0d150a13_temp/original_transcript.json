    "Ok, I made it through step 4. All 21 steps passed. There were 3 collections in Firestore remaining after running the script, so I went in and deleted them manually. To confirm, are you sure none of the other module files need to be updated like memory_service? I didn't see that, but think previous chat made updates to all those module files for the test. I could be wrong on that though. Let me know if there is anything you need from me to determine that, but all files are in Project knowledge. For the additional deployment script, let me know what I need to add and where before the push. Existing deploy.sh and .tf files are in Project knowledge as well. What's next?"
