    " I'd be happy to discuss how I (Claude) could integrate with your AI-system-backend-v2 project that now has Gemini integration. Since the system is designed with a modular approach to AI services, adding Claude would be a natural extension.\n\nHere's how Claude integration could work with your system:\n\n## Integration Approach\n\n1. **Create a ClaudeAPI Class**: Similar to your GeminiProAPI class, create a dedicated class for Claude integration:\n   - Handle authentication via Anthropic API key\n   - Implement message sending with appropriate formatting\n   - Support conversation history\n\n2. **Add Claude to Your AI Capabilities Registry**:\n   - Register Claude's capabilities (reasoning, text generation, etc.)\n   - Define task types best suited for Claude\n\n3. **Create Endpoint Handlers**:\n   - `/execute_claude` for basic prompts\n   - `/execute_claude_conversation` for multi-turn conversations\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **API Authentication**: Use API key authentication (similar to your Gemini approach)\n2. **Message Formatting**: Format messages according to Anthropic's API requirements\n3. **Response Parsing**: Handle Claude's specific response format\n4. **Model Selection Logic**: Update your task assignment logic to route appropriate tasks to Claude\n\n## Benefits of Adding Claude\n\nAdding Claude would enhance your system by:\n- **Model Diversity**: Provides redundancy and specialized capabilities\n- **Task Optimization**: Route tasks to the most suitable model based on strengths\n- **Response Comparison**: Compare outputs from different models for verification\n- **Fallback Mechanism**: If one service is unavailable, the system can use alternatives\n\nThe existing architecture of your system with its adaptive discovery, conversation management, and custom routing would make Claude integration relatively straightforward.\n\nWould you like me to outline some specific code examples for how the Claude integration would work with your existing system?"
