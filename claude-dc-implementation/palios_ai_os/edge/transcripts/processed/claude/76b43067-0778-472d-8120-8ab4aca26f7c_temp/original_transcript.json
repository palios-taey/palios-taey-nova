    " Let me complete the health_check function and then provide you with a requirements.txt file update. \n\nNow, let's update the requirements.txt file to include the new dependencies: \n\n\n\nNow, let's create a test script to verify our updated implementation: \n\n\n\nLet's also create a simple installation and setup guide to help implement these improvements: \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let's create a code to test and monitor API usage, as recommended in the immediate actions: \n\n\n\nLet me guide you through implementing and testing the improvements we've made to the AI System Backend. Here's what to do next:\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Create the required files:**\n\n    All the necessary files have been created as artifacts in your working directory:\n    - `rate_limiter.py` - Token bucket rate limiting implementation\n    - `ai_provider_factory.py` - Provider-agnostic factory pattern\n    - `config_loader.py` - Environment variable configuration\n    - `updated_handler.py` - Updated handler with improvements\n    - `.env.example` - Example environment configuration\n    - `test_updated_handler.py` - Test script\n    - `api_usage_monitor.py` - API usage monitoring tool\n\n2. **Create a `.env` file:**\n\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.example .env\n    ```\n\n3. **Update your `.env` file with your actual API keys:**\n\n    ```\n    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key\n    VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=ai-execution-system\n    LOG_LEVEL=INFO\n    ```\n\n4. **Install updated dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n5. **Test the implementation locally:**\n\n    ```bash\n    python test_updated_handler.py\n    ```\n\n6. **Monitor API usage** (after some API usage has been recorded):\n\n    ```bash\n    python api_usage_monitor.py 7 text\n    ```\n\n## What to Review\n\nThe improvements we've implemented include:\n\n1. **More Robust Error Handling**: Enhanced logging and better error recovery.\n2. **Provider-Agnostic Factory Pattern**: Makes it easy to switch between AI providers"
