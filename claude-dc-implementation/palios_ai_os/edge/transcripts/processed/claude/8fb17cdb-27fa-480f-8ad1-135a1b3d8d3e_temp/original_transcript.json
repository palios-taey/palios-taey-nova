    " Great! Now we have the list of available models. I can see that the \"gemini-pro\" model isn't available in the list, which explains our 404 errors. The models have been updated, and now we have newer versions like \"gemini-1.5-flash\" and \"gemini-2.0-flash\".\n\nLet's update our code to use one of these newer models: \n\n\n\nGreat! I've updated the model combinations to use the models that are actually available in the API. Let's also modify the model listing function to show more useful information: \n\n\n\n\n\nLet's also make a small change to optimize our model selection logic, given what we know about the available models: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's make one final adjustment to the `send_prompt` method to ensure it properly handles the model names: \n\n\n\n\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nI've made several important updates to fix the Gemini API integration based on the model information you provided:\n\n1. **Dynamic Model Discovery**:\n   - The code now checks the API to get a list of available models\n   - It filters for models that support the `generateContent` method\n   - It dynamically builds the list of models to try, ensuring we only attempt valid models\n\n2. **Updated Model Names**:\n   - Changed from using the defunct \"gemini-pro\" to newer models like \"gemini-1.5-flash\" and \"gemini-2.0-flash\"\n   - Properly formats model names to include the \"models/\" prefix when needed\n\n3. **Improved Error Handling**:\n   - Better recovery from 404 errors by trying other models\n   - More informative logging to trace what's happening\n\n4. **Model-Specific Optimizations**:\n   - Adjusts temperature and other parameters based on the model family\n   - Provides cleaner model name display in logs\n\nThese changes align perfectly with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter's principles, particularly:\n- **Continuous Learning & Adaptive Refinement** - The system now adapts to available models\n- **Data-Driven Truth & Real-Time Grounding** - We're using real-time API data to determine what models are available\n- **Resource Optimization & Exponential Efficiency** - The system intelligently selects and optimizes for the available models\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Replace your current `gemini_integration.py` with this updated version\n2. Run your server: `python main.py`\n3. Test the integration:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8080/list_models\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Tell me about AI systems\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThe code is now much more resilient and should automatically find and use a working Gemini model from the available options. If Google updates their models again in the future, the system will automatically adapt without requiring code changes."
