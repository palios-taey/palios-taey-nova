    "I checked with Grok, to better understand capabilities on its end, with the objective of retaining optimized AI output while minimizing human effort. This was his response. I feel this is consistent with Milestone 4 in the MVP doc. This is my last submission I'm allowed for 3 hours. My plan is to compile the Gemini transcript into a single doc. As I'm doing that, I can pull out some examples of debugging and we can resume with the plan you develop based on the response below. You decide what's next."
