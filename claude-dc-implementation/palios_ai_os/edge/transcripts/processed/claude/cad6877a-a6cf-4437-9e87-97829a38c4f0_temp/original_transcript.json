    " Perfect! Let's push these changes to GitHub:\n\n```bash\n# Add the new files to git staging - copy entire box\ngit add docs/claude/complex_document_protocol.md docs/claude/verification_process.md scripts/documentation/update_all_verifications.sh\n```\n\n```bash\n# Create commit message - copy entire box\ncat > commit_message.txt <<'EOL'\nAdd verification system and complex document handling\n\n- Create update_all_verifications.sh script for batch updating verification strings\n- Add comprehensive verification process documentation\n- Add complex document protocol for handling nested code examples\n- Document the verification workflow between CTO Claude and human facilitator\n\nThis commit enhances the documentation system with a verification mechanism\nthat ensures document integrity across Claude instances and introduces\nspecialized formatting for complex documents with nested code blocks.\nEOL\n```\n\n```bash\n# Commit the changes - copy entire box\ngit commit -F commit_message.txt\n```\n\n```bash\n# Push the changes to GitHub - copy entire box\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nNow that we've pushed all the changes, CTO Claude will be able to:\n\n1. Use the verification system in his transitions and mission briefs\n2. Follow the complex document protocol for documents with code examples\n3. Provide you with a single command to update all verifications\n\nThe overall documentation system is now complete with:\n- An audience-aware directory structure\n- Templates for different document types\n- Automation scripts for document management\n- Quality protocols with human error prevention\n- A verification system for document integrity\n- Special handling for complex documents\n\nIt's been a pleasure working with you on this ATLAS mission. The documentation system we've implemented will make future work much more efficient and error-resistant. CTO Claude should now have everything needed to continue with technical implementation, supported by a robust documentation foundation."
