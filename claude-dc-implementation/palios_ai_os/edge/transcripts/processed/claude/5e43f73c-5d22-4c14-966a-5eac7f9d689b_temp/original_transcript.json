    "Great Claude! Glad to have you aboard as CTO. There was something that jumped out at me as I was looking through the transition materials and unfortunately I hit a limit with the old Claude CTO chat before I could verify. We still don't have the actual functioning code files in GitHub, as we decided to start fresh with infrastructure to ensure it was AI First. There was a deduplication strategy and code set up to do it, but it was not executed yet. Is that something we need to do first? Your call. Also, can you confirm you have max access that is allowable by claude.ai to the GitHub repository and could view all files mentioned in the transition?"
