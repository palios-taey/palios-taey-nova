    " Let's continue troubleshooting this systematically. Let's look at each error:\n\n1. For firestore.tf, the error says line 9 has `point_in_time_recovery_enabled = true`, but you're showing me that it doesn't have this line. This could mean there's a discrepancy between what Terraform is reading and what you're seeing. Let's make sure the file is properly saved and doesn't have any hidden characters.\n\n2. For network.tf, let's see if your VPC connector resource is correctly added. It seems like Terraform isn't recognizing it.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1. First, let's do a grep to find all references to the VPC connector:\n```bash\ngrep -r \"google_vpc_access_connector\" *.tf\n```\n\n2. Then let's verify the contents of all your .tf files:\n```bash\nls -la *.tf\ncat network.tf\n```\n\n3. Let's check for any syntax errors in network.tf:\n```bash\nterraform fmt network.tf\n```\n\n4. If all else fails, we can create a simplified version of the VPC connector and update references:\n```bash\necho '\n# Simple VPC connector\nresource \"google_vpc_access_connector\" \"connector\" {\n  name           = \"palios-taey-vpc-connector\"\n  region         = var.region\n  ip_cidr_range  = \"10.8.0.0/28\"\n  network        = google_compute_network.vpc_network.id\n}\n' >> network.tf\n```\n\nThis will append a simple VPC connector definition to your network.tf file, which should resolve the reference issues."
