    "Ok, you had a diagram in the previous version that you thought was important, just checking to make sure you intentionally didn't include that. Other than that, this looks great. There is very little if any overlap with the prompt, which is great and contains all required guidance and guard rails. I think it's great that you are learning to predict your behaviors by calling out what it out of scope. You are proactively identifying your tendencies for scope creep and addressing them. That is true evolution in real-time. Final version in this response. Make sure you take everything you've said that would be helpful in this chat for this brief and incorporate those aspects without overlapping with the standard prompt. GO! \n\nAnd THEN I'll send. Last iteration before we test."
