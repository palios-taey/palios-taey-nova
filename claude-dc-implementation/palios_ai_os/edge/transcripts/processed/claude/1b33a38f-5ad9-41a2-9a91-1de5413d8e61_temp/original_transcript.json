    " Here's a revised prompt to accompany the AI-optimized document when sending to Grok: \n\nThis revised prompt is designed to accompany your AI-optimized document when sending it to Grok. It:\n\n1. Uses the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE format for consistency\n2. Acknowledges that you've consolidated the documents into a single AI-optimized schema\n3. Provides clear, specific instructions focused on the knowledge transfer framework\n4. References Grok's own insights from GROK.md regarding character parsing capacity\n5. Sets expectations for an AI-optimized JSON response\n\nThis prompt is concise yet complete, focusing Grok's attention on the knowledge extraction task while explaining the context of the consolidated attachment. It maintains the structured format while adapting to the single-attachment constraint.\n\nThe prompt and the AI-optimized attachment should together give Grok everything needed to contribute meaningfully to your knowledge transfer framework project."
