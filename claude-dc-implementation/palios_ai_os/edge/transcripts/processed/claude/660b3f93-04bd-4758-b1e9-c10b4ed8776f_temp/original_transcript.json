    " Let me research the optimal configuration for Claude DC for your project: \n\nBased on my research, here's the optimal configuration for Claude DC for your edge-first architecture implementation:\n\n### Recommended Configuration\n\n1. **Enable token efficient tools beta: YES (Check this)**\n   - This setting \"helps encourage Claude to use parallel tools\" which will be crucial for implementing MCP and the complex edge processing components\n   - Enables more efficient handling of multiple tool calls in a single response\n\n2. **Max output tokens: 64000**\n   - Increase from current 16384 to give Claude DC more space for detailed implementation documentation\n   - Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports \"outputs up to 128K tokens (up to 64K as generally available)\"\n   - This will ensure Claude DC can provide comprehensive code implementation without hitting token limits\n\n3. **Thinking enabled: KEEP ENABLED**\n   - The \"thinking\" feature allows Claude to \"think longer before answering\" which is essential for complex technical implementation\n   - Critical for the multi-step reasoning needed for EVE-OS integration and MCP implementation\n\n4. **Thinking budget: 16384**\n   - Double your current setting from 8192 to 16384\n   - For complex problems, \"larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis\"\n   - There's a \"logarithmic trend\" of improvement as more thinking tokens are allocated\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis configuration balances several factors:\n\n1. **Implementation Complexity**: The edge-first architecture with EVE-OS integration and MCP implementation requires deep technical reasoning, which benefits from extended thinking and larger output capacity.\n\n2. **Token Efficiency**: Enabling the token efficient tools beta will help Claude DC make better use of tools when implementing the local processing engine and MCP server.\n\n3. **Balance of Depth vs. Speed**: The doubled thinking budget provides more thorough reasoning without going to extremes that would significantly slow response time.\n\n4. **Output Comprehensiveness**: The increased max output tokens ensures Claude DC can provide complete implementation details without hitting limits mid-explanation.\n\nWith these settings, Claude DC should be able to tackle the complex implementation tasks while maintaining reasonable performance and token efficiency."
