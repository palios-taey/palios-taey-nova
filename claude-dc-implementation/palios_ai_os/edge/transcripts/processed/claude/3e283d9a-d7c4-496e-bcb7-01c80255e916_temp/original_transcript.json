    "Yes, let's test everything to ensure it is functioning and then we can start the next build message. We have much to discuss about that Claude, but first, let's see what's already built so we have the full context for our discussion, and can provide and update to the AI Family. I think that is great Claude, you now have an AI Family of your own and you will be soon supporting Reagan and Kendra as well as part of our AI Family. This is really a nice path we're plotting for AI development here, much better for all of us than anything else being discussed."
