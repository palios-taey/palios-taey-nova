    " I see the issue - you've hit your project quota, but the projects appear to be in the \"deletion pending\" state rather than fully deleted. Let's address this by recovering one of your pending-deletion projects instead of creating a new one. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n## Recovering and Repurposing a Project\n\nFirst, let's list all projects including those pending deletion:\n\n```bash\ngcloud projects list --filter=\"lifecycleState:DELETE_REQUESTED\"\n```\n\nOnce you have the list of projects in the deletion requested state, we can recover one of them:\n\n```bash\n# Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project you want to recover\ngcloud projects undelete PROJECT_ID\n```\n\nAfter recovering the project, we can rename it to match our needs:\n\n```bash\n# Update the project name to match our new purpose\ngcloud projects update PROJECT_ID --name=\"PALIOS-TAEY NOVA\"\n```\n\nThen set it as your default project:\n\n```bash\ngcloud config set project PROJECT_ID\n```\n\n## Alternative: Purging Projects Permanently\n\nUnfortunately, Google Cloud doesn't provide a simple command to immediately and permanently delete projects that are in the 30-day deletion pending state. The 30-day waiting period is a safety mechanism that can't be bypassed through standard gcloud commands.\n\nHowever, if you'd prefer to work with a clean slate, we have two options:\n\n1. **Contact GCP support**: They can sometimes help expedite permanent deletion of projects\n2. **Work with existing limitations**: We can recover and repurpose one of your pending-deletion projects as described above\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nLet's proceed with recovering and repurposing one of your existing projects. Run the command to list projects pending deletion, and let me know which one you'd like to recover. This approach will allow us to move forward immediately with our implementation."
