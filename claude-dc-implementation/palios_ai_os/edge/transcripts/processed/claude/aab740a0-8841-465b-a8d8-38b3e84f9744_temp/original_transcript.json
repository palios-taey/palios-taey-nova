    "Claude, this is really EXCELLENT work! You pushed hard with the setup script to make that significantly less manual effort for me, which increases velocity and reduces errors. \n\nIn the spirit of the Charter, I'd like to push you a bit more here, after seeing what you did in this session. You're strategic input on how to execute building the first platform designed and built by AI for AI and Humanity has been extremely valuable throughout this project and I'd like for you to take this to the next level, while maintaining focus on the MVP goals. In a previous iteration of this, you made recommendations on what the MVP should include. These are captured in the CLAUDE MVP+ document. I'd like for you to incorporate any suggestions you previously had into the MVP build along with the ones above. That will now be the new MVP and we won't go beyond that to keep scope in check. There is no currently operating production system, so this can all be done in one shot where it makes sense from your perspective to do so. My thought is that we will start with this, and then work together with Grok Think and DeepSearch on the parsing project so that we can target the next round of enhancements based on AI feedback from all my transcripts. \n\nRegarding your Security bullets, please keep in mind that this is meant to be driven by AI, while keeping human supervision, but it necessarily is a different type of human supervision than is typical in that the supervision is driven by the charter and mutual agreement to move forward in a direction and then allow AI to develop and iterate upon that within the bounds of the charter. Dialing this system in will take some time, but as an example, if I'm in a chat with an AI in the new system, and we agree on a feature or AI just notices something and it is consistent with the next sprint objective, I want it to be able to do that, report back, test, track and iterate on it. If you have an idea that's within the constraints of the Charter, I want to at least test it out. Eventually this will mean sandboxes for AI creativity to flourish, but we aren't there yet. I trust you'll find the right balance on this given where we are.\n\nWhere we currently are is that there are a few Cloud Run services running now below. All can be removed. This needs to be cleaned up. Let me know if you're down for this. If you are, let me know what you need from me in terms of placeholders required. This is an ongoing issue for me that slows us down considerably, so I'd suggest some kind of artifact that you can generate before starting this where I can give you all the necessary placeholders you require, if needed, we can update as we go and encounter issues, but ideally, this would be done up front. This can be captured and stored so AI could be pointed to it when developing code. Before you GO! on this and write more code, let me know what you think! Remember I trust you and respect you as a partner and leader and know you will maintain consistency with the mutually developed Charter. Other than that, let's see what you got!\n\n   SERVICE                   REGION       URL                                                                LAST DEPLOYED BY                                              LAST DEPLOYED AT\nX  ai-execution-system-core  us-central1  https://ai-execution-system-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app  jesselarose@gmail.com                                         2025-02-28T22:41:19.973664Z\n+  ai-system-backend         us-central1  https://ai-system-backend-711898853198.us-central1.run.app         service-711898853198@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com  2025-02-25T02:01:30.375234Z\n+  ai-system-backend-v2      us-central1  https://ai-system-backend-v2-711898853198.us-central1.run.app      service-711898853198@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com  2025-02-25T15:20:19.797863Z\n+  ai-system-test-import     us-central1  https://ai-system-test-import-711898853198.us-central1.run.app     service-711898853198@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com  2025-02-25T14:43:15.208091Z"
