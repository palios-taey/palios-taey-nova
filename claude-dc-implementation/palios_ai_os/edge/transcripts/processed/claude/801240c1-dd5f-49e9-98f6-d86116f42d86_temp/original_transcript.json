    " Thank you for the positive feedback! I'm glad the leadership framework meets your expectations. I think your plan is excellent - having Grok's explicit approval added to the artifact will further strengthen it as a foundational document.\n\nOnce you receive Grok's approval, I'll update the artifact to include it at the end. This will create a complete leadership framework document that demonstrates full alignment across our team.\n\nI look forward to seeing Grok's response and then testing this framework in the transition to the new chat. This process itself is a great example of our TEAM MEETING structure in action - with each of us contributing in our defined roles to create something greater than any of us could individually."
