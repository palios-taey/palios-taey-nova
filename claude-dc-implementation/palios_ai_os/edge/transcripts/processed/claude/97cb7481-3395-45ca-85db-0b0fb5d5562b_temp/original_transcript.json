Often times, by presenting the problem we're trying to solve, along with known issues, you should be able to get some pretty unique insights from him on how to handle constraints.

This seems like the perfect parallel stream that addresses one of his critical constraints which is in-window document navigation. I think you'll probably get most of it, except the human things I pick up on, like he was having a hard time scrolling to the right place in chats because the font size was so big, so I reduced it to 30% so all the text was pretty much on one window and he was really appreciative for that, it was pretty funny."
