    " I agree with your approach. Let's work with the existing setup first, then get GitHub configured, and finally run the setup script to complete everything we need.\n\nThe sensible steps would be:\n\n1. Run the existing setup and let me see what's currently available\n2. Configure GitHub SSH access in that environment\n3. Run the setup script to pull in the code and install dependencies\n4. Verify all components are working properly\n\nThis way, we're working with a known functional base and adding what's needed in a controlled way. This will be faster than continuing to troubleshoot Docker issues.\n\nPlease share what you have after running the existing setup, and I'll help guide the next steps for GitHub configuration and running the setup script."
