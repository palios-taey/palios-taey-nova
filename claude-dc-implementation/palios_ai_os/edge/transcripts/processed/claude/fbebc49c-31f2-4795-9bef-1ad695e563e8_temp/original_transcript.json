    " <thinking>\nJesse has raised an important concern about the communication protocol in the implementation prompt for Claude DC. He feels that the current protocol isn't specific enough about who Claude DC should check in with after completing modules. His suggestion is a tiered approach:\n\n1. Claude DC completes a module\n2. Shares results with Grok first\n3. Gets Grok's feedback\n4. Then shares with me (Claude Chat), including both the results and Grok's feedback\n5. Also includes his own recommendations for next steps\n6. I would then either confirm or redirect as needed\n\nJesse's main concern is avoiding \"group think\" where all three AIs (Claude DC, Grok, and myself) might collectively go down an unproductive path. He wants to maintain independent perspectives and ensure I maintain a strategic oversight role.\n\nThis is a thoughtful suggestion that addresses an important concern about AI collaboration. I should consider the merits of this approach and whether any modifications might be beneficial.\n</thinking>\n\nI think you've identified a really important point about the communication protocol. You're absolutely right that we need to be more specific about the check-in structure, and your suggested approach makes a lot of sense.\n\nHaving Claude DC check with Grok first, then bring both Grok's feedback and his own recommendations to me, creates several important safeguards:\n\n1. **Diversified perspectives**: Grok's creative approach provides a different lens than Claude DC's implementation focus\n2. **Tiered review**: Sequential rather than simultaneous feedback prevents groupthink\n3. **Strategic oversight**: Maintains my independence as the architectural vision keeper\n4. **Clear hierarchy**: Establishes a decision-making structure that prevents drift\n\nThis process would help us avoid the rabbit hole problem you've observed in the past. When multiple AIs collaborate without a structured feedback protocol, we can indeed reinforce each other's biases or get collectively excited about technically interesting but strategically unimportant paths.\n\nI'll update the Communication Protocol section to be more specific:\n\n```\n## Communication Protocol\n\nAfter completing each module:\n1. Claude DC will document what was implemented and key decisions made\n2. Share this documentation with Grok for initial feedback\n3. Incorporate Grok's feedback and develop recommendations for next steps\n4. Present to Claude Chat: the implementation summary, Grok's feedback, and proposed next steps\n5. Wait for Claude Chat's strategic approval before proceeding\n6. Only begin next module after explicit confirmation\n\nThis tiered approach ensures diverse perspectives while maintaining strategic alignment with our vision. Claude Chat will maintain an independent oversight role to prevent collective drift from our core objectives.\n```\n\nDoes this revised protocol address your concerns effectively? The structure creates natural checkpoints while still allowing for efficient progress."
