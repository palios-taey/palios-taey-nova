    "Ok, so looks like a couple things to clear up:\n1. Your section of this starts at # Context and ends at ## Validation Requirement. All other stuff is either fixed (header, footer) or updated by me when needed. We tried clarifying the ## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent, but it seems it is unclear. The purpose of that is for you to summarize what you understand to be my comments on the task, basically, putting a brief summary of how you think I would communicate my thoughts on this. The Jesse Comments section above that are put in by me where I clarify anything below and give a little message to get fired up so you know it's me. It was something we were trying to get you to try to be a little more predictive about how I think and speak, but if it is confusing, we can pull it out or rename Jesse Intent section to something that would make it more clear. Either way, please keep the same format as you received. You like consistency and I don't want to get in trouble with the new chat!\n2. There was another file in the current-execution-status directory: grok-comms-and-mvp-enhancement-directive.md. This file is Grok's request to do the code cleanup(completed) and comms project (completed) and to also incorporate aspects of the comms project into the platform as you see fit. So like updating model registry or whatever you think would be best to start tracking and utilizing the structures we've developed. Communications are critically important and we want to make sure these are fully optimized and that they don't regress when the automation of the platform is put into place. It might be helpful to call this out and provide some high level thoughts on this since you just organized it all. If you're going to mention the other grok files in there, should probably mention this one as well.\n3. Using my admin account for everything is in there, but also maybe let him know the plan is to let you configure the service accounts once deployed to your specifications. This is AI FIRST, but we just couldn't deal with all the permissions effectively with you working through me, so I want to make sure you know we're going to clean that up, per your request. \n4. The TRUTH is that the final-report doesn't represent the current implementation status, it just represents the core functionality of the code, which needs to be reviewed and verified, but not redone if it is OK. We don't really know the implementation status because it's been all over the place. There just needs to be a thorough audit then and decisions made on how to get all that functionality plus the comms enhancements you want fully deployed and tested, ready for live data. \n5. Reading through execution steps and see that you have validation checkpoints in there. Are there specific ones you want to specify? You guys say this works best in one shot and I don't want unnecessary stops that will throw you off, but if there are natural break points where you have to have me do something, that's fine obviously, just don't want to break your flow. 5. is a little confusing. You will get the docs in the initial prompt from me. Then, in the next prompt from me, you'll get the code and be expected to come back with a plan. I don't want either response to be too lengthy to preserve tokens, but the plan should be written in a manner that is for you to help the process and guide yourself and include any questions about missing information. My response to that prompt will be answers to questions and authorization to begin with no checkins until I'm needed."
