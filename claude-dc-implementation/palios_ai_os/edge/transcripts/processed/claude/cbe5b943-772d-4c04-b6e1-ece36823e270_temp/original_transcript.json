    " Great! Now that we have your organization ID (135174585026), we should definitely incorporate this into our infrastructure setup. This is a significant improvement as it provides better governance, security controls, and resource management.\n\nLet's run our infrastructure setup script with the organization ID:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project true --org-id 135174585026 --billing-account 01962C-C920B9-40F054 --environment dev\n```\n\nHaving the organization ID allows the Terraform configuration to properly organize resources within your Google Cloud hierarchy, which will make future management and security enforcement much cleaner.\n\nThe script and Terraform configurations I've created will handle all the organization-level configurations needed for this stage, including:\n\n1. Creating a new project under your organization\n2. Setting up proper IAM permissions at the organization level\n3. Establishing resource hierarchy\n4. Configuring appropriate organization policies\n\nThis approach leverages Google's best practices for enterprise-grade infrastructure and sets a solid foundation for the PALIOS-TAEY system. The script will manage all these aspects automatically - you won't need to configure the organization separately."
