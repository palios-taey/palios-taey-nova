    " I'm very pleased with your assessment of the cache. Based on the feedback and your request, I'll create prompts for each AI system to load the cache files and request their approval for the Claude DC build instructions.\n\n## Understanding of Approach\nI agree with the approach of providing each AI with prompts that:\n1. Introduce the cache files that will be provided in sequence\n2. Ask them to hold judgment until all context is reviewed\n3.
