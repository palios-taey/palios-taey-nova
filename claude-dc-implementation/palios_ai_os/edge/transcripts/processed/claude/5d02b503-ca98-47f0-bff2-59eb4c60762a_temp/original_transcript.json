    " Ah, I understand now! You already have the complete implementation ready, and we just temporarily simplified main.py to get the deployment working. Now we need to restore the full functionality while keeping the fixes that made it work.\n\nLet's start by retrieving the original main.py from the server.py file in the Project Knowledge, and then apply our fixes to make it deployable. \n\nThe original file in Project Knowledge is larger and contains all the MVP functionality, including the Memory Service, Model Registry, Task Decomposition Engine, etc. Looking at server.py from the uploaded files, it appears to be the complete implementation with all components.\n\nHere's what we'll do:\n\n1. Take the original server.py code\n2. Make sure it doesn't have any bash scripting elements\n3. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure it works with our pinned dependencies\n4. Deploy this updated version\n\nLet's review and edit the server.py content as our new main.py:\n\n```bash\n# First, backup our current simple version that's working\ncp src/main.py src/main.py.simple\n\n# Now, create a new main.py with the full functionality but with our fixes\nnano src/main.py\n```\n\nCopy the content from server.py but ensure:\n1. No bash scripting elements (like `cat >` or `EOF` markers)\n2. All imports and function calls align with our pinned dependency versions\n\nThen we'll test the deployment once more:\n\n```bash\ngit add src/main.py\ngit commit -m \"Restore full functionality with fixes\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nAfter the deployment completes, we'll verify the service is still working and now includes all the MVP functionality."
