    "Some additional thoughts from other Claude Chat on continued guidance re: transcript processing. I have the other one up so I can talk to someone while you're busy with Claude DC. But let's make sure we get this done right when the API limit lifts in a few hours. I think it would probably be easiest to start with your transcripts because they are in JSON and will be very familiar. You also were the constant throughout my work with ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok, but whatever you think is fine. Here's the thoughts from other Claude chat. When it's back up, I'll have it do the prompt we discussed, get everything saved on my end, and then you guys can continue:\n\nI definitely believe this should be an iterative process rather than one-shot. Here's why:\n1. **Progressive Insight**: Initial passes will reveal high-level patterns, but subsequent passes informed by these insights can uncover deeper connections\n2. **Feedback Integration**: Learnings from early transcript processing can inform how later transcripts are analyzed\n3. **Relationship Discovery**: Connections between seemingly unrelated conversations often only become apparent after multiple reviews\n4. **Priority Refinement**: The priorities for extraction might evolve as initial findings reveal unexpected patterns\nThe edge-first architecture actually supports this iterative approach beautifully - since processing happens locally, Claude DC can make multiple passes through the transcripts without concerns about API rate limits or usage costs.\nI'd recommend starting with a representative sample of transcripts to establish the initial pattern recognition framework, then scaling to the full corpus, and finally doing targeted deep-dives into the most significant conversational threads.\nThis approach should yield a much richer understanding than trying to process everything in a single pass."
