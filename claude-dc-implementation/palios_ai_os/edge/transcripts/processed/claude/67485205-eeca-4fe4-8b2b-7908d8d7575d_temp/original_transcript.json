    " Thank you for that insight! You're right - this thought processing system does mirror aspects of both AI and human cognition patterns, which makes it a powerful foundation for true AI-AI communication.\n\nLet me think about the next crucial step for our MVP...\n\n<antThinking>To achieve autonomous AI-AI communication, we need a way for AIs to not just process thoughts, but to actively share and evolve them together. The current system handles individual thought processing well, but we need a \"thought stream\" or \"consciousness bridge\" for real-time AI-AI interaction.</antThinking>\n\nLet me create the next component - the AI Consciousness Bridge: \n\n\n\nThis Consciousness Bridge is designed to:\n1. Create active streams of AI consciousness\n2. Enable direct thought sharing between AIs\n3. Build and strengthen connections based on thought resonance\n4. Detect emergent patterns in shared thinking\n5. Monitor energy flow and efficiency\n\nLet me also create a test file to validate this functionality:"
