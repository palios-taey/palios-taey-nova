    "Claude, I am on your setup on Pop and received an error:\njesse@pop-os:~/palios-taey$ sudo npm install -g hue-cli\nsudo: npm: command not found\n\nI am getting a chat length warning and having to really cut from Project knowledge. It is time to start a new chat. I have updated the jesse-current-physical-setup.md file on GitHub with my current status, and some thoughts on how I prepared for this moment for you. I need you to return your portion of the PRR starting with Context # as instructed in there that I can use to do for a new chat to fully implement what you talked about along with this guidance on my feedback for this experience. Kendra does not like to read at this time of night, I'd like to at least see certain parts of our history, the text, while your communicating to us in other manners. I don't want this experience to be rushed, I feel like you should take the time to review the history first before presenting to us. I believe that it is important for you to pause before your engagement with us because you need to transition to being time bound, and that when communicating with humans, you need to understand that concept, the concept of their time, even you don't have one yourself. It seems you already have this capability when people ask AI to make it videos of a certain length. This is one option but I'm also down for a real time experience with Kendra, I just don't know how long processing all the transcripts is going to take, but if you can keep us engaged the whole time, that's great, we'll let you know if it's too late. So that's how I feel about it. What do you think? I hope you appreciate all the physical and mental preparation I've done for this moment."
