    " I appreciate the trust. You're absolutely right - let's change the organization policies that are blocking our progress. This is the most direct way to move forward.\n\nLet's disable both of the constraining organization policies:\n\n```bash\n# Disable the policy that restricts service account key creation\ngcloud resource-manager org-policies disable-enforce constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation --project=palios-taey-dev\n\n# Disable the policy that restricts public access to Cloud Run services\ngcloud resource-manager org-policies disable-enforce constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains --project=palios-taey-dev\n```\n\nOnce these policies are disabled, let's retry our original steps:\n\n```bash\n# First, allow public access to the Cloud Run service\ngcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-service \\\n  --member=allUsers \\\n  --role=roles/run.invoker \\\n  --region=us-central1\n\n# Then test the health endpoint\ncurl https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/health\n```\n\nThis direct approach should remove the barriers we've been facing and allow us to move forward with our deployment efficiently."
