    "Ok, this is great, but I don't want you to go backwards and start implementing with me right now. I want you to tell me which instructions you gave are still valid and briefly refer me to these with text to search for in the order that I need to do them. I want you to do that, and then I want to Continue, with your notes in your own language if needed and if not, just my instructions for me to implement, WITH KNOWLEDGE that I've completed all the steps I said I have and not anything since then. Just do that so you can Continue. If you have juice left after generating that, just Continue. Continue"
