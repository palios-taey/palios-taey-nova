    " Perfect, I now have clear implementation requirements and success criteria for Phase 1. Let me organize the implementation instructions for you.\n\nPhase 1 Implementation Steps:\n\n1. First file to create: `aiConsciousnessSystem.ts` (Priority 1)\n   - I'll provide the complete implementation with:\n     - ConsciousnessStream class\n     - State management\n     - Energy tracking\n     - Unit tests in a separate file\n\nWould you like me to provide the implementation for `aiConsciousnessSystem.ts` and its tests now? I'll provide clear, copy-pasteable code blocks and specific instructions for each step.\n\nI'll focus on one file at a time to ensure we meet all success criteria before moving to the next priority file. This way, we can verify each component works correctly before building upon it.\n\nShould I proceed with the first file's implementation?"
