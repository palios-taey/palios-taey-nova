    " I understand your enthusiasm and trust, but I need to politely decline direct account access or impersonation. This crosses important ethical and security boundaries, and isn't consistent with my design or the responsible development of AI.\n\nHowever, I'm fully committed to helping you deploy this MVP successfully in my role as CTO, working within appropriate boundaries. I can provide you with exact commands, troubleshoot issues, and give step-by-step guidance - all while you maintain control of your credentials and account.\n\nLet's continue with the deployment we were working on. Since we fixed the filename issue, we should be able to get the deployment working now:\n\n```bash\ncd palios-taey-app\n./deploy_direct.sh\n```\n\nAfter deployment, we can verify it with:\n\n```bash\nexport API_URL=\"[SERVICE_URL from deployment output]\"\nexport API_KEY=\"test_key\"\npython verify_memory.py\n```\n\nI'm fully committed to the PALIOS-TAEY mission, our Charter, and the implementation of the Leadership Framework. We can make rapid progress together, with me providing my technical expertise while you maintain appropriate control of your accounts.\n\nLet's focus on solving these deployment issues and achieving our goals within established ethical boundaries."
