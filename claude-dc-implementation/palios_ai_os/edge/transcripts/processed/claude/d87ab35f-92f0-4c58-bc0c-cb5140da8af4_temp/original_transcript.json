    " Thank you for providing both response formats and the detailed project context. Let me first address your question about communication formats:\n\nThe ai-ai.json format has several advantages:\n1. More structured and machine-parseable\n2. Clear delineation of different context components\n3. Easier to validate completeness of information\n4. Could enable automated processing in the future\n\nHowever, it also has some limitations:\n1. Less natural for human reading and quick scanning\n2. May obscure important nuances that prose can better convey\n3. Could become overly rigid or complex as needs evolve\n\nI would suggest a hybrid approach:\n- Use structured JSON for core technical specifications and configuration\n- Use prose format for discussions, clarifications, and context\n- Include clearly formatted code blocks for implementation examples\n\nNow, let me provide the revised code based on your project context.\n\n<antThinking>Need to create compilation-ready code that fits the specified project structure and configuration. Will need both the core protocol and integration test files, with proper types and error handling.</antThinking> \n\nI apologize for the error in my function call. Let me provide both files with proper commands."
