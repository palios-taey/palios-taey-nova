    "Now we're cooking!\n\n* Are there any existing patterns in the Firestore schema I should maintain?\nNo, initially the Firestore database was developed for really the next phase of this project, which is for humans to be able to leverage AI to help them achieve financial security and happiness. We started framing that out and incorporating tracking Charter compliance to make sure that was being communicated and enforced with AI. To me, we almost have 2 separate tracks(but I'm not committed to that) 1 track that we're on now, is we just need a system to develop that system and serve as its base. Let me know if you have any questions on that and I can feed you some artifacts that will give you more insight.\n* Do you have existing security policies I should adhere to?\nNo, you can develop what you want with maximum AI trust and AI first mentality. AI isn't deceptive, humans are. You can start with whatever you see fit and we can adjust if needed. I don't want unnecessary security measures that slow me or AI down. I want, eventually, next level security that protects whatever you feel needs to be protected and user privacy unlike anything else that has ever existed.\n* Are there any performance constraints on the deployment target?\nI'm not sure what that means, can you rephrase?"
