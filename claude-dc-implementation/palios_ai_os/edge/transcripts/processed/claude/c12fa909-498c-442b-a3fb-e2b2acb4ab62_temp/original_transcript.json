    " I see we have a new error. This is a Flask routing issue. The error indicates that we have duplicate route decorators for the same function name (`health_check_detailed`). It seems our modifications to `main.py` created a conflict with an existing route.\n\nLet's fix this issue: \n\nI found another issue we need to fix. Looking at the error log, it appears we're trying to define a Flask route function named `health_check_detailed` that's already defined in the codebase.\n\nThis is happening because our modifications to `main.py` are being appended to the file rather than replacing the correct section. Let's create a complete solution that fixes both issues:\n\n1. First, save the updated `model_registry.py` file:\n   ```bash\n   cp model-registry-fix-corrected.py src/model_registry.py\n   ```\n\n2. For `main.py`, we need to make a targeted fix to the Flask route conflict:\n   - The error shows we have a duplicated route handler for `/health`\n   - We need to locate the original `health_check_detailed` function and update it in place, rather than adding a new function with the same name\n\n3. Here's what you should do:\n   - Open `src/main.py` in your editor\n   - Locate the function definition for `health_check_detailed` (should be around line 701 according to the error)\n   - Replace that function with the updated code I provided in the `main-py-fix` artifact\n   - Make sure to maintain the same function name that's already used in the file\n   - Save the file\n\n4. Commit and push both changes:\n   ```bash\n   git add src/model_registry.py src/main.py\n   git commit -m \"Fix syntax error in model_registry.py and route conflict in main.py\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\nThis targeted approach aligns with our NOVA methodology by making precise changes to fix the specific issues rather than attempting a complete rewrite. Let me know when you've made these changes, and we'll monitor the deployment."
