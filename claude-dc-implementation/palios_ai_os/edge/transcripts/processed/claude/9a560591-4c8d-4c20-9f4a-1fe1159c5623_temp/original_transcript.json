    " Excellent! Now that we have the GitHub secret set up, let's make sure our repository is ready for deployment. We need to make a few adjustments to ensure everything works correctly.\n\n1. First, let's make sure our Dockerfile is properly configured. Pull the latest changes from GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit pull origin main\n```\n\n2. Now, let's verify the Dockerfile structure. If it needs adjustments, update it to match our repository structure:\n\n```bash\n# Check current Dockerfile\ncat Dockerfile\n\n# If needed, edit to ensure it looks like this:\ncat > Dockerfile << 'EOF'\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the application files\nCOPY src/ .\n\n# Create necessary directories\nRUN mkdir -p logs config/model_capabilities config/decomposition_rules data\n\n# Expose the port for the application\nEXPOSE 8080\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PORT=8080\n\n# Run the application\nCMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\nEOF\n```\n\n3. Ensure we have a proper `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\n# Check current requirements.txt\ncat requirements.txt\n\n# If needed, update it to ensure all dependencies are included\n```\n\n4. Let's create an Artifact Registry repository to store our container images:\n\n```bash\ngcloud artifacts repositories create palios-taey-containers \\\n  --repository-format=docker \\\n  --location=us-central1 \\\n  --description=\"PALIOS-TAEY container images\"\n```\n\n5. Now let's commit any changes to trigger our deployment pipeline:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Configure deployment files for GCP Cloud Run\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n6. Once the push completes, our GitHub Actions workflow will automatically start deploying the application. You can monitor the progress by going to:\n   - GitHub repository -> Actions tab\n\n7. After deployment completes, verify the service is running:\n\n```bash\ngcloud run services list --platform managed --region us-central1\n```\n\nThis will show the URL of our deployed service. We can then test it with:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://palios-taey-core-[hash].us-central1.run.app/api/health\n```\n\nLet me know when the deployment is complete and if you encounter any issues during the process. I'll help troubleshoot and ensure we have a successful deployment of our MVP."
