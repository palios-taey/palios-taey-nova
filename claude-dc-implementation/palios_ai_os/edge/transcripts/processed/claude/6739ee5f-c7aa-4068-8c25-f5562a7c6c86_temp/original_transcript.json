    " This error means that Node.js and npm aren't correctly installed or added to your system PATH. Let's fix this:\n\n## Fix npm not recognized issue:\n\n1. **Verify Node.js installation:**\n   - Open Windows Command Prompt\n   - Type `where node` and press Enter\n   - If it doesn't show a path, Node.js isn't properly installed\n\n2. **Re-install Node.js properly:**\n   - If you already installed Node.js but it's not working, uninstall it first from Control Panel\n   - Download Node.js again from https://nodejs.org/\n   - During installation, make sure to check the option \"Automatically install the necessary tools\" AND \"Add to PATH\"\n   - Complete the installation and **restart your computer**\n\n3. **After restarting, open a new Command Prompt and verify:**\n   - Type `node -v` (should show version number)\n   - Type `npm -v` (should show npm version number)\n\n4. **If still not working, manually add to PATH:**\n   - Search for \"Environment Variables\" in Windows search\n   - Click \"Edit the system environment variables\"\n   - Click \"Environment Variables\" button at the bottom\n   - In the \"System variables\" section, find \"Path\" and click \"Edit\"\n   - Add these two entries (adjust the path if Node.js was installed elsewhere):\n     ```\n     C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\\n     C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\n     ```\n   - Click OK on all dialogs\n   - Restart Command Prompt and try again\n\n5. **Alternative temporary solution:**\n   - You can also run npm directly using its full path:\n   - Open Command Prompt and navigate to your project folder\n   - Try running: \n     ```\n     \"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm\" install firebase openai\n     ```\n   - And:\n     ```\n     \"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node\" test.js\n     ```\n\nLet me know if you need more specific guidance on any of these steps."
