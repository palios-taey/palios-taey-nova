    " Since you'll be the only human using this organization, there's no need to create all those standard groups right now. The roles and permissions we're setting up through Terraform will handle the necessary access controls. \n\nLet's keep the setup minimal and focused on what we need for the PALIOS-TAEY infrastructure. You can proceed through the checklist to get to the billing setup without creating these admin groups.\n\nIf the system requires you to complete certain steps of the checklist before proceeding, just click through with the minimal selections needed. The important part is getting to the point where we can link the billing account to the project so Terraform can proceed with creating our infrastructure.\n\nOnce you've linked the billing account to your new \"PALIOS-TAEY-dev\" project, we can modify the Terraform configuration to use this existing project instead of trying to create a new one."
