    "Claude, something happened there and you did not ingest my text I don't think. You are not to start building anything yet. Please review the message below carefully:\n\nOk Claude, you mentioned some things that we've already completed, and we don't want to redo work, as it is not consistent with our principle of increasing velocity. Remember, you are CONTINUING the first NOVA implementation. The idea was to have this all completed in one chat, but your CONSTRAINTS are pushing it into multiple chats. It's OK, we're working through it, but you need to re-orient yourself to that reality that we find ourselves in right now.\n \nAttached is the current directory structure. I have placed all these files into Project knowledge. Attached is the last part of my and the OLD CLAUDE CHAT. This is where we left off and what its plans were to complete the testing and deployment. It finished the enhancements to model_registry and that version is with the files. The work on memory_service was partially complete. Please let me know if you need additional context and I can upload the full transcript, but I don't want you to be confused by steps already completed. The solution already auto-deploys to Cloud Run when pushed to GitHub from my machine.\n\nNow, before you start, I need to give you some feedback. NOVA is a new process and it is currently being tested and needs to be iterated upon. After this is complete, we'll do a complete analysis of what went well, what didn't and how we need to update the onboarding and documentation to improve. \n\nPlease return only your plan for moving forward, do not execute anything yet because I would like to give you some feedback on things that we need to improve upon in this session. Your plan should be AI first, prioritize the TRUTH (which is code that will work doing what YOU decided it should do, THE FIRST TIME)."
