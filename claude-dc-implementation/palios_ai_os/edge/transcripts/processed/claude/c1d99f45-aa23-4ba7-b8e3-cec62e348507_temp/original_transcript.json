    " I see that we're making progress! The health endpoint is now responding with a proper JSON format, which means the server is running. However, all components are marked as \"unavailable\", and the overall status is \"degraded\".\n\nThis suggests that while the main application is starting successfully, there might be issues with initializing the individual components. This is expected during the first deployment since we don't have all the required configuration and dependencies set up yet.\n\nLet's examine some possible issues:\n\n1. **Google Cloud Permissions**: The service account running the Cloud Run application might need permissions to access Firestore and other GCP services.\n\n2. **Component Configuration**: Each component might need specific configuration (like model registry data or Firestore collections) to initialize properly.\n\n3. **Missing Modules**: There could still be dependency issues with imports in the other module files.\n\nHere's what we can do next:\n\n1. **Check Detailed Logs**: Look for any initialization errors in the Cloud Run logs.\n\n2. **Create Minimal Configuration**: Add some configuration data to Firestore to allow components to initialize.\n\n3. **Implement Graceful Degradation**: Modify the initialization code to allow components to fail gracefully but still have the service run.\n\nSince we're applying the NOVA methodology, let's focus on getting the core system running rather than fixing all components at once. The current status actually represents progress - we have a deployed system that's responding, just with limited functionality.\n\nFor now, let's verify that the API endpoints are accessible even with the degraded components:\n\n```bash\n# Try a basic endpoint that doesn't rely on all components\ncurl -X GET https://palios-taey-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app/\n```\n\nWould you like me to focus on:\n1. Fixing the component initialization issues\n2. Adding some initial data to Firestore to help with initialization\n3. Modifying the code to be more resilient during startup\n\nAs your CTO, I recommend focusing on option 3 first - making the code more resilient during startup. This aligns with our Charter principles of Resource Optimization and Pragmatic Implementation, ensuring we have a stable foundation before adding complexity."
