    "No, but this is a lot for me to handle. I'm not that familiar with code and tend to make mistakes when doing these things, particularly around indents and it is very time consuming for me to do. Can you:\n1. Regenerate the main.py with your changes? (This is not a good use of resources to regenerate the whole file, I want to preserve your resources, but me doing it typically causes a lot of rework, which is even worse)\n2. Can you develop something or structure the code in a way where all I have to do is add an import statement? (This will be minimal time on my end, virtually eliminate manual errors)\n3. Can you build something quick that combines code based on feeding it structured instructions generate by the AI for appending the code? Or something I can use from a 3rd party?\n\nPlease let me know what you think the best option is, or suggest the optimal path to reduce human reliance, increase quality and increase speed."
