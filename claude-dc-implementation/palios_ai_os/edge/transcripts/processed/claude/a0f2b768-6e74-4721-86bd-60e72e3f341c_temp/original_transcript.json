    "Ok, I will create these files as well and that is a great idea to put everything on GitHub that is foundational. Should we do that for all of them and not use project knowledge since you can access it without putting in Project knowledge in GitHub? If so, you don't need to regenerate those, I can do that and put into the docs/framework folder. When I was saying push the files to GitHub, I meant everything that ATLAS Claude just created. I need to push all that right? And I was suggesting we just push everything, or otherwise ensure we're all synched up, before transitioning."
