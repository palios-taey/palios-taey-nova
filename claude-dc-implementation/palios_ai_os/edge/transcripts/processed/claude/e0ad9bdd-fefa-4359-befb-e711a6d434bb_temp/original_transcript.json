    "Ok, please remember to use cat code boxes for all scripts. This is something that should have been covered extensively in the documentation along with the 6Sigma code quality checks. This is not occurring and it is very concerning. We spent an entire day revamping the documentation and its structure for you and instituting these policies to enable us to work better together. cat boxes force the naming convention you want to use that you make errors on when you generate artifacts and also reduce manual labor and errors.\n\n\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?"
