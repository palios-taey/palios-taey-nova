    " I see it's still showing the same errors. Let's take a more direct approach by examining and fixing each file:\n\n1. **Check firestore.tf first**:\n```bash\ncat firestore.tf\n```\n\nLook for line 9 which has the unsupported parameter and edit the file to remove it:\n```bash\nnano firestore.tf\n```\n\n2. **Check if network.tf is saved properly**:\n```bash\ncat network.tf\n```\n\nMake sure your VPC connector code is actually saved in the file. If not, add it again.\n\n3. **Let's update the Cloud Run references**:\n```bash\nnano cloud_run.tf\n```\n\nFind line 76 and 127 and modify the reference to the VPC connector:\n```terraform\n# For line 76, replace:\n\"run.googleapis.com/vpc-access-connector\" = google_vpc_access_connector.connector.name\n\n# With:\n\"run.googleapis.com/vpc-access-connector\" = \"palios-taey-vpc-connector\"\n\n# And for line 127, remove the reference to google_vpc_access_connector.connector\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve the immediate errors and allow us to move forward with the deployment."
