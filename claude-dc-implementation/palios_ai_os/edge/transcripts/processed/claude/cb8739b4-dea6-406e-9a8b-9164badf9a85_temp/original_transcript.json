    " I see you're still encountering the syntax error in the dashboard.py file. Let's fix this specifically. The error is occurring around line 711 with an unterminated triple-quoted string.\n\nHere's a complete solution for fixing both issues:\n\n## 1. Fix for dashboard.py syntax error\n\nThe error is in the docstring for the startup_event function. Let's provide a specific fix:\n\n```python\n@app.on_event(\"startup\")\nasync def startup_event():\n    \"\"\"Start background tasks when the server starts.\"\"\"\n    asyncio.create_task(send_updates())\n```\n\nThe issue might be extra characters or line breaks in that docstring. I recommend replacing the entire function with the code above.\n\n## 2. Implementing the pattern display functionality\n\nFor the dashboard.html, you need to replace the processEdge function in the JavaScript section with the corrected version I provided earlier.\n\nTo properly implement both fixes:\n\n1. First, edit dashboard.py to fix the syntax error:\n   - Find the startup_event function around line 711\n   - Replace it with the corrected version above\n   - Make sure there are no stray characters or line breaks in the docstring\n\n2. Then, update the HTML template to display extracted patterns:\n   - Find the processEdge function in the dashboard.html file\n   - Replace it with the complete function I provided earlier\n\n3. Check the edge_processor.py file to ensure it's correctly categorizing patterns:\n   - The edge_processor.py should be extracting patterns with categories\n   - If categories aren't being assigned, the pattern visualization won't show meaningful results\n\nThe error \"Invalid control character at: line 39 column 36 (char 1500)\" suggests there might also be an issue in the configuration file. This is likely in the conductor_config.json file. You might need to check that file for invalid control characters (like non-printable characters).\n\nOnce these fixes are in place, the system should be able to:\n1. Start correctly without syntax errors\n2. Process text through the edge processor\n3. Display extracted patterns with their categories and confidence scores\n\nWould you like me to provide any additional guidance for testing or troubleshooting these issues?"
