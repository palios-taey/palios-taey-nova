    " You don't need to remove any sections from the CTO Transition document as it provides important context, but we should update it with the current project status.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. **Keep the existing structure** of the CTO Transition document intact.\n\n2. **Update the \"CURRENT_STATUS\" section** with the information I provided about our shift to a hybrid approach.\n\n3. **Update the \"IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\" section** to reflect that we're now in Phase 3 (Infrastructure & Deployment) with our hybrid approach.\n\n4. **Update the \"VERIFICATION_STRING\"** to something that reflects our current state, like \"NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_THREE_HYBRID_APPROACH\".\n\nFor the commit message, I suggest:\n```\nUpdate ATLAS missions for hybrid cloud deployment approach and add file creation best practices\n```\n\nThis captures both the strategic shift to the hybrid approach and the important file creation best practices we've incorporated.\n\nWhen pushing the three missions to the docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development directory, please include all three missions I provided. This ensures that the entire cloud deployment strategy is documented in GitHub even if we're starting with Mission 1."
