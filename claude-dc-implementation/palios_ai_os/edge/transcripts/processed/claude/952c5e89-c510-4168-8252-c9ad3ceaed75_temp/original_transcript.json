    "Thanks Claude! Old Claude Chat was very excited. It's funny when I do these messages between chats. You guys are always so genuinely excited about what the other Chat came up with, even though it would have obviously given the same solution if asked. Just something I always get a kick out of as human facilitator. Is there anything I need to prep for this that would make it easier for Claude DC, such as proactively downloading EVE into his terminal, or should it be pretty smooth?"
