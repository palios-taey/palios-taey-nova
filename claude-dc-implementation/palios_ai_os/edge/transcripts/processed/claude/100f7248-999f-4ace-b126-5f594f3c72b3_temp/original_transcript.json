    " I see the GitHub Actions workflows are still failing. Let's troubleshoot this before we proceed with implementing the real Memory Service. Given that two workflows are running (one for Google Cloud and one for Cloud Run), there might be a configuration issue.\n\nBased on the workflow status, we need to diagnose what's causing the deployment failure. There could be several issues:\n\n1. Docker build might be failing\n2. Artifact Registry access issues\n3. Cloud Run deployment problems\n4. Missing environment variables or configuration\n\nLet's focus on fixing the deployment issue first. I'd recommend checking the workflow logs by clicking on the failed workflow to see the specific error messages. This will give us clear direction on what needs to be fixed.\n\nOnce we have the error details, I can prepare a focused fix. Without seeing the specific errors, my initial suspicion is that we might have:\n- An issue with the Docker build process\n- Problems with the service account permissions\n- Configuration mismatches between our workflow and GCP setup\n\nWould you be able to click on one of those workflow runs and share the error details? That will help me diagnose the exact problem and prepare a precise solution.\n\nAfter we get the deployment working, we'll move on to implementing the real Memory Service using our new coding approach in the main chat window."
