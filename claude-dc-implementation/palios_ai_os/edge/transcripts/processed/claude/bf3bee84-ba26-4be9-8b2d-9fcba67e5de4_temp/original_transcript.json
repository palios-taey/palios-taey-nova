    " It looks like we need to modify the script since it's requiring an organization ID even though you don't have one. For personal Google Cloud accounts, projects are created directly without an organization.\n\nLet's modify the `apply_infrastructure.sh` script to make the organization ID optional. Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. Open the script in a text editor:\n```bash\nnano scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh\n```\n\n2. Find the validation section that's checking for organization ID (around line 50-60). It should look something like this:\n```bash\n# Validate project creation requirements\nif [[ \"$CREATE_PROJECT\" == \"true\" ]]; then\n  if [[ -z \"$ORG_ID\" || -z \"$BILLING_ACCOUNT\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Error: When creating a new project, both org-id and billing-account are required\"\n    exit 1\n  fi\nfi\n```\n\n3. Change it to make the organization ID optional:\n```bash\n# Validate project creation requirements\nif [[ \"$CREATE_PROJECT\" == \"true\" ]]; then\n  if [[ -z \"$BILLING_ACCOUNT\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Error: When creating a new project, billing-account is required\"\n    exit 1\n  fi\nfi\n```\n\n4. Save the file and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)\n\n5. Now we also need to modify the Terraform code to handle project creation without an organization. Edit the `terraform/main.tf` file:\n```bash\nnano terraform/main.tf\n```\n\n6. Find the `google_project` resource definition. It should look like:\n```terraform\n# Create a GCP project if it doesn't exist yet\nresource \"google_project\" \"palios_taey_project\" {\n  count           = var.create_project ? 1 : 0\n  name            = var.project_name\n  project_id      = var.project_id\n  org_id          = var.org_id\n  billing_account = var.billing_account\n  \n  labels = {\n    environment = var.environment\n    project     = \"palios-taey\"\n    managed-by  = \"terraform\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Modify it to make org_id optional by using the `folder_id` attribute as an alternative:\n```terraform\n# Create a GCP project if it doesn't exist yet\nresource \"google_project\" \"palios_taey_project\" {\n  count           = var.create_project ? 1 : 0\n  name            = var.project_name\n  project_id      = var.project_id\n  billing_account = var.billing_account\n  \n  # Use org_id only if provided, otherwise the project will be created in the default location\n  org_id          = var.org_id != \"\" ? var.org_id : null\n  \n  labels = {\n    environment = var.environment\n    project     = \"palios-taey\"\n    managed-by  = \"terraform\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n8. Save the file and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)\n\nNow try running the script again without specifying an organization ID:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project true --billing-account 012796-3C9A41-E282F5 --environment dev\n```\n\nThis should now work for a personal Google Cloud account without requiring an organization ID."
