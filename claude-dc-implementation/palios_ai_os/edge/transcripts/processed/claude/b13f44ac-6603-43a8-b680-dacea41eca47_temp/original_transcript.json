    "Yes, Claude, you got it! Go ahead and take a stab at the first mission brief, if aligned, you can crank out the others. Actually what do you think works best for you? I pushed to have you do all of them at once because I wanted to push you to think through the whole thing. You'll also have to think like this when this is up and running to a certain extent right? Directive comes in with Grok, ATLAS plan, get all the parts completed, deploy, next. Some things will be able to be done in parallel. Think a new build with multiple modules like we're did here. If properly scoped out for ATLAS, these can be done in parallel, but combining them for testing must have all of them completed first, which is sequential. Tasks need to be broken down based on constraints. For now, that's a single chat. In the future that will be a single API response, so we've got to get this figured out and tight. What do you think about that and how does it apply to this ATLAS build?"
