    " No, Vertex AI needs separate testing. Looking at our code, while we have Vertex AI in our capabilities registration, we haven't actually implemented the Vertex AI processing - we're just raising a NotImplementedError when it's called. \n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add Vertex AI implementation and testing, or\n2. Continue building out the strategic planning component I mentioned earlier?\n\nThe Vertex AI would give us more model diversity and capabilities, but the strategic planning component would get us closer to your goal of having AI help with financial and happiness objectives. Your call on which provides more immediate value."
