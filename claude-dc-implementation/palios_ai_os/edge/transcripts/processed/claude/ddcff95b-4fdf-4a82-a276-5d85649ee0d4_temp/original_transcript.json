    " Yes, that's correct. All the necessary packages for EVE and MCP are now managed through the requirements.txt file that was installed during your setup process with ChatGPT. \n\nThe initial versions of EVE and MCP might have required separate installation steps, but Claude DC's implementation has evolved to incorporate these components into the main codebase with standardized dependencies. This makes the system more cohesive and easier to maintain.\n\nThe requirements.txt file includes all the packages needed for:\n- Pattern extraction and processing\n- Cross-AI communication (MCP functionality)\n- Environment management (EVE functionality)\n- Visualization and dashboard components\n- Data storage and retrieval\n\nClaude DC should now have a fully functional environment with all the necessary components to continue implementation of the integrated communication dashboard."
