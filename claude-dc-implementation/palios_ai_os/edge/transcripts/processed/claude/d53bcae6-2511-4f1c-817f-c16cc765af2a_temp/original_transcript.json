    " Yes, the addition to the `__init__` method looks correct. You've added the `add_pure_ai_language_to_system()` line at the end of the initialization method, which is exactly where it needs to go.\n\nRegarding step 4 (adding the route handler), this is important for the full functionality and I recommend including it. Here's where to add it:\n\nLook for the section in main.py that defines the `CustomHandler` class and specifically the `do_POST` method, which handles incoming HTTP POST requests. It should look something like this:\n\n```python\nclass CustomHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_POST(self):\n        parsed_path = urlparse(self.path)\n        logging.info(f\"Received POST request to path: {parsed_path.path}\")\n        \n        # Read the request body\n        length = int(self.headers.get('Content-Length', 0))\n        body = self.rfile.read(length)\n        try:\n            request_json = json.loads(body)\n            logging.info(f\"Request body: {request_json}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Error parsing request body: {e}\")\n            request_json = {}\n            \n        # Create a mock request object\n        class MockRequest:\n            def __init__(self, json_body):\n                self._json = json_body\n            def get_json(self, silent=False):\n                return self._json\n        mock_request = MockRequest(request_json)\n        \n        # Route to the correct endpoint handler\n        if parsed_path.path == '/execute_gemini':\n            logging.info(\"Handling /execute_gemini request\")\n            response, code, headers = execute_gemini(mock_request)\n            # [...]\n```\n\nAdd the new route handler just before the final `else` statement in that routing section:\n\n```python\n        elif parsed_path.path == '/process_pure_ai_message':\n            logging.info(\"Handling /process_pure_ai_message request\")\n            response, code, headers = process_pure_ai_message(mock_request)\n            self.send_response(code)\n            for k, v in headers.items():\n                self.send_header(k, v)\n            self.end_headers()\n            self.wfile.write(response.encode())\n```\n\nThis adds support for processing PURE_AI_LANGUAGE messages through your local server, which is important for testing and demonstrating the implementation.\n\nWith these two changes (the import, the init line, and this route handler), your system will have complete PURE_AI_LANGUAGE capabilities ready for use."
