    " I'll provide you with all the specific commands and prompts you need to execute this process from your local machine. Since I don't have direct access to your GitHub repository, we'll need to handle everything through your local environment.\n\n## Step 1: Add and commit the test workflow file\n\nFirst, let's add the test API enablement workflow file to your repository:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your repository root\ncd ~/path/to/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Create the workflows directory if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\n\n# Save the test workflow file\n# (You mentioned you already have this saved, just make sure it's in the right location)\n# The path should be: .github/workflows/test-api-enablement.yml\n\n# Add the file to git\ngit add .github/workflows/test-api-enablement.yml\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Add API enablement test workflow\"\n\n# Push to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n## Step 2: Add and commit the deployment workflow file\n\nNow let's add the deployment workflow file:\n\n```bash\n# Create the deployment workflow file\n# Save the content I provided earlier to this file:\n# .github/workflows/deploy-cloud-build.yml\n\n# Add the file to git\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy-cloud-build.yml\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Add Cloud Build deployment workflow\"\n\n# Push to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n## Step 3: Run the test workflow from GitHub UI\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser (https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova)\n2. Click on the \"Actions\" tab at the top\n3. You should see the \"Test API Enablement\" workflow in the left sidebar (if not, click on \"All workflows\")\n4. Click on it, then click the \"Run workflow\" button (dropdown on the right)\n5. Select the \"main\" branch and click the green \"Run workflow\" button\n\n## Step 4: Check test results\n\n1. In the GitHub Actions tab, you'll see your workflow run start\n2. Click on it to see the details\n3. Watch for successful completion of all steps\n4. If any step fails, note the error message for troubleshooting\n\n## Step 5: Run the deployment workflow from GitHub UI\n\nAfter confirming the test was successful:\n1. Go back to the \"Actions\" tab\n2. Find the \"Deploy via Cloud Build\" workflow in the sidebar\n3. Click on it, then click the \"Run workflow\" button\n4. Select the \"main\" branch and click the green \"Run workflow\" button\n\n## Step 6: Verify deployment\n\n1. In the GitHub Actions tab, find your deployment workflow run\n2. Click to see details\n3. After it completes, look at the \"Show URL\" step output to find the service URL\n4. Open that URL in your browser and add \"/health\" to check the health endpoint\n\n## Regarding duplicate files\n\nFor the duplicate files issue, let's first check what files are duplicated:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your repository root\ncd ~/path/to/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Find duplicate files (this will show files with same content)\nfind . -type f -not -path \"*/\\.*\" -not -path \"*/node_modules/*\" -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 -d\n\n# Alternative approach to see all files and their paths\nfind . -type f | sort\n```\n\nAfter identifying the duplicates, we can determine if they need to be cleaned up before or after deployment.\n\nWould you like me to provide further guidance on specific commands or steps in this process?"
