    "This is excellent work Claude! This is a team of one human (me) working with AIs to implement this. This is a system built for AI, by AI, for AI and Humanity in accordance with The Charter. We will need to test and implement locally and then report back to Gemini. Do you have any tips on working with you in an optimal manner? I notice when chat gets long, it says it uses more of my capacity allocation for the day. Does this make sense to test in this chat? Or should you generate a message with necessary attachments I need to include and open a new chat? If you'd like to proceed with testing in this chat, please walk me through it and return my first step. If new chat, please provide instructions for that chat with necessary attachments. You decide."
