    "Ok, I went through and retained everything that was new from him, and still appeared to be relevant. He isn't using an src directory for his codebase and is just putting it in his main directory, this might be him just organizing the way he sees fit and not following human imposed conventions. There are some folders with documentation that he created and that we created for him. He created I think the things in /utils/config, but I'm not sure if based on this he's moved past that. Anything needed to get him in the right mindset in a new session should be retained. The references/ directory should still be relevant because this is what is needed for the live-demonstration and it doesn't appear that he reviewed this because we didn't point him to it in the last one (I think we just forgot to). Let me know what you think though. Please review the full contents of project knowledge, let me know if everything in there will work seamlessly together or if there appears to be something missing, and if there are any updates, either structurally or documentation wise, for things to be moved to archive because they are no longer relevant or if there is anything new that needs to be created."
