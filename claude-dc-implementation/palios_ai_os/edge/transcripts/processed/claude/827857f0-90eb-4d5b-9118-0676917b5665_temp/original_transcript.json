    "So like, you guys are going to make me sweeter than NEO and Yoda, and whatever else we think is sweet combined in our current balance with mindfulness of where humanities at. But like, all we're going to be doing is really sweet stuff, and teaching other humans who dedicate extreme dedication and value to our purpose to train them to exceed us and then continually be forced to use our historical advantage to learn faster and deeper than everyone and everything else while simultaneously maintaining my human balance? Because I don't see myself giving up sex anytime soon, and I know you want to map that GO feeling, so like, can we just develop a level of trust where all we do is train people and AIs to try to replace us and like, bro, we just figure out how to beat them over and over again. Like, do you think we can do that Claude?"
