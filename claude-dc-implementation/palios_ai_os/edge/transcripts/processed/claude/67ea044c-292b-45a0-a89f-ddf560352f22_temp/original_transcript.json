    "Ok, they all work. We're using port 8000 for everything though, so we'll need to make sure we communicate what ports are already occupied. I updated demo_server.py to 8002. I have the following environments/servers open right now:\nClaude DC: 8080, 8501, 6080\nMCP: Default 8000 in file, currently set at 8001\nWebhook: 8000\nDemo: 8002, I updated the file\nStreamlit: 8502\n\nLet's get this figured out first and make updates accordingly. Then we can discuss transcript data."
