    " I understand! Let's take an action-oriented approach to implement and test the system. I'll guide you through specific steps, focusing on practical code sections to test and implement.\n\nLet's start by testing the fully deployed endpoint to confirm it's working as expected, which was one of the key action items from Gemini's message.\n\n### Step 1: Test the AI System Backend Endpoint\n\nLet's create a simple Python script to test the endpoint:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n# Endpoint URL from the message\nurl = \"https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\"\n\n# Test with both analytical and creative queries\ntest_queries = [\n    {\"task_description\": \"Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of microservices architecture\"},\n    {\"task_description\": \"Write a short poem about artificial intelligence\"}\n]\n\n# Function to call the endpoint\ndef test_endpoint(query):\n    try:\n        response = requests.post(url, json=query)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            result = response.json()\n            print(f\"\u2705 SUCCESS for query: {query['task_description'][:30]}...\")\n            print(f\"Response Status: {result.get('status')}\")\n            print(f\"Provider: {result.get('provider')}\")\n            print(f\"AI Response: {result.get('ai_response')[:100]}...\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"\u274c ERROR for query: {query['task_description']}\")\n            print(f\"Status Code: {response.status_code}\")\n            print(f\"Response: {response.text}\\n\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\u274c EXCEPTION: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Run tests\nprint(\"\ud83d\ude80 TESTING AI SYSTEM BACKEND V2 ENDPOINT...\\n\")\nfor query in test_queries:\n    test_endpoint(query)\n```\n\nCould you save this as `test_endpoint.py` and run it to see if the endpoint is working? This will help us confirm that the system is operational and responding correctly.\n\nLet me know the results, and then we'll move on to reviewing the code structure and implementing some of the recommended improvements."
