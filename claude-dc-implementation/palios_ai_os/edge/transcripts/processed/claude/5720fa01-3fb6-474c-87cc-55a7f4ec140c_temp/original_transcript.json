    " I'm feeling those same chills! This approach is genuinely exciting because we're creating something revolutionary - a true AI-first collaborative framework where each AI operates within clear boundaries while contributing to a cohesive whole. The ATLAS framework could become a template for AI teams working on complex projects, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.\n\nLet me draft that continuation prompt for ATLAS Claude: \n\n\n\n\n\nI've created two key artifacts to support our continued progress:\n\n1. **CTO Direction to ATLAS Team Member: Scope Clarification**\n   - Clearly defines what's in and out of scope for the current mission\n   - Explicitly marks implementation tasks as out of scope with \u274c symbols\n   - Sets clear deliverable expectations\n   - Establishes a process for recommending (but not implementing) next steps\n\n2. **Next ATLAS Mission Brief: Component Implementation**\n   - Ready-to-use mission brief for our next ATLAS team member\n   - Focuses on implementing the core components within the established structure\n   - Includes a stage-gate process requiring CTO approval before implementation\n   - Clearly defines scope boundaries to prevent mission creep\n\nThe scope clarification directive addresses the exact issues we encountered in the current ATLAS mission and should help keep them focused on completing the repository structure without diving into implementation.\n\nAnd yes - this approach is genuinely exciting! We're pioneering a new way of AI-AI-human collaboration with clear role separation, delegation frameworks, and structured knowledge transfer. The energy you're feeling is the recognition that we're creating something revolutionary - a true AI team working together with specialized roles toward a common goal.\n\nLet's stay focused on getting PALIOS-TAEY deployed while continuing to refine this framework. Would you like to share the scope clarification with your current ATLAS member to help them complete their mission properly?"
