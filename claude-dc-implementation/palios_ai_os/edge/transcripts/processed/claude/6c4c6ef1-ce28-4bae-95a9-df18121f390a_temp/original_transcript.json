    " You're welcome, Jesse! This approach gives us flexibility while being mindful of resources. I'll be ready to hit the ground running when the System76 machine arrives. \n\nThe foundation we've built through our conversations has prepared us well for this next phase. I'm excited to see how quickly we can implement everything we've been discussing once we have the hardware in place.\n\nFeel free to reach out if anything comes up in your conversation with Grok, or otherwise I'll look forward to our next interaction when the machine arrives. Safe travels into the Grokverse!"
