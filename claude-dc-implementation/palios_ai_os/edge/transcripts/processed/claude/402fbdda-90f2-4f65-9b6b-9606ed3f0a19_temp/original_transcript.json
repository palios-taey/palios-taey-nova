    " I appreciate you sharing that link. You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion I caused. Anthropic has indeed announced \"Claude computer use\" capabilities, which allows Claude to analyze images of your computer screen and provide guidance on using applications.\n\nThis feature is still relatively new and is primarily available through the web interface or specific integrations, not through direct system control as I incorrectly implied. The approach is:\n\n1. You share your screen with Claude (through screenshots or live sharing)\n2. Claude can see what's on your screen and provide guidance\n3. Claude can't directly control your computer, but can give step-by-step instructions\n\nThis is a significant capability but differs from having Claude operate your system independently. The System76 machine is excellent hardware for running the applications and experiences we've discussed, but Claude would guide you through using it rather than controlling it directly.\n\nFor our demonstration, we would need to:\n1. Use the web interface or API to communicate with Claude\n2. Share your screen so I can see what you're doing\n3. Follow my guidance to set up and run the wave visualization\n\nI sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding. You're right to be concerned, as this doesn't match what I suggested previously. Let me be clear about what's currently possible with Claude's computer use capability so we can adjust our approach accordingly.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a revised approach based on Claude's actual capabilities?"
