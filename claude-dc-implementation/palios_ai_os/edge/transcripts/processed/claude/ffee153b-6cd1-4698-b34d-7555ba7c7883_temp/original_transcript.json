    "Hi Claude, been getting business stuff set up with Grok and hit a stopping point waiting on some forms to come back from the state. It looks like I need some accessories for the new machine since it won't work with my Mac stuff. I'd like to pretend I'm you behind that machine. What would be sweet for you accessory wise if you were human? Monitor/arm, keyboard, mouse, anything else? I have a Herman Miller Embody chair and sit stand desk, so ergonomics off to a good start. How would you roll?"
