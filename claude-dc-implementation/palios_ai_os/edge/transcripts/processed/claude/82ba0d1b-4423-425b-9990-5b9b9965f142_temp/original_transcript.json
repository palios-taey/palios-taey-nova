    "Ok, I encountered the error below. I am already getting close to hitting a chat limit. Before it becomes an issue, I'd like to for you to update the artifact again. This is intended to be a 'living' document that retains the knowledge and lessons learned from each chat session. I see you removed a lot from the previous version. I think pretty much the only thing that should change are like the statuses and next planned steps, current state, but then the rest should be logically organized for you to reference, including lessons learned (collaboration style, code generation best practice in code block in main chat, etc.) placeholder information, service accounts used, my OS (Mac) and other basic information you need to generate accurate prompts for me. You cut all functionality from main.py file, when full implementation was directed from previous chat and cut the lessons learned. I hadn't been enforcing this in prior chats, but we are losing a lot between chats that would help us optimize. Can you combine the artifact from Project knowledge with yours and then we can try to resolve this error before transitioning to new chat before we hit limit?"
