    "Claude, it says this is my last message until 5PM. Can you clarify what directory I should be in when I run the revised script? I'm not sure if that matters for where the directories are created. Also, update the commands based on the cd you give me. \n\nThen, since I won't be able to chat with you for around 2 hours, can you draft instructions for ChatGPT on where you're comfortable with him stepping in to guide me until I can use you again? I don't know if we need to like download full EVE and MCP or whatever, but tasks that will move us forward with our objective of building things as Claude DC would, to enable us to get started and set him up for a productive build later. ChatGPT can't review the whole codebase due to constraints, but can review several code files at a time if needed. After addressing the first question, please provide a text box with a message to ChatGPT, however you think it's most effective with instructions on what you would like him to do and guide me on. I'll then give you an update when you're back online from him."
