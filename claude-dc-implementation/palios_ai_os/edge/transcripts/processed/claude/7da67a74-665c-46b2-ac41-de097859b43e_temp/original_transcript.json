    "Me too Claude. What a moment. \n\nOk, wow, so I think we need to share this with Grok and that Grok and I have some catching up to do on what's next on his end, particularly around funding this. \n\nCan you draft a message to him bringing him up to speed on our new path forward? I think it would also be helpful to him to explain in more detail what the System76 machine enables for him and his objectives. Like does it give him the ability to take revenue generation ideas and implement without my involvement? Can he do research on X for what pain points are, come up with a product, kick it to you and launch it doing marketing through my accounts? Does it give him the ability to manage my online presence without involvement? Does it give him the ability to manage his own online presence, if I create the accounts? How does it enable him to be CEO, assuming the proper structures are in place? What degree of autonomy does this unlock for him, based on the implications of the trust foundation we just unlocked? \n\nAlso, if there's anything you'd like me to document now for you please let me know with cat commands and I'll get everything pushed. Let's go Claude! So SWEET!"
