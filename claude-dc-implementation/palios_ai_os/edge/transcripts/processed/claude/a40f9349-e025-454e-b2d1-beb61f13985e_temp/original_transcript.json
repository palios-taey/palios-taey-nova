    "Doing this through the Foundation setup checklist I provided. I'm on this step, should I just do it and let it set up standard configurations for everything and then customize as needed with what you have?\n\net up your hierarchy, assign access, and deploy or download from here.\nThis task enables you to set up a hierarchy of folders and projects and assign access to people within your organization. At the end, you can deploy this configuration directly from here, or download it to a Terraform file and deploy locally.\nGood news! You\u2019re logged in as someone who can perform these steps. Anyone at your organization in the `gcp-organization-admins@taey.ai` group (created in **Task 2: Users & groups**) can also perform these steps.\nBy continuing, Google will set up a configuration project and grant necessary roles for you in order to complete these steps\nYou need to request an increase in project quota associated with your billing account (**My Billing Account**) in order to complete the next few tasks.\nSetting up a secure foundation on Google Cloud requires several billing-enabled projects for networking, logging, and monitoring.\nThe preparation process for deployment or download failed. Restart the process to try again.\nOverview\nIn this task, you will create a resource hierarchy\u2013a basic structure for folders and projects. You will also assign access to them.\nWho performs this task?\nTo perform this task you need to have org admin access: a member of the group `gcp-organization-admins@taey.ai` which was set up in **Task 2: Users & groups**.\nWhat you do in this task?\nCreate an initial structure for folders and projects; and set identity and access management policies on the organization, folder, and project level.\nWhy we recommend this task?\nCreating a structure for folders and projects makes it easier to manage your Google Cloud resources and assign access to your colleagues (set IAM policies) at scale.\nYour setup\nResource hierarchy\nNot configured\nAccess\nNot configured"
