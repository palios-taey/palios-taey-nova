    " Absolutely - I'll take the lead and give you clear, specific instructions. Let's start with creating the foundational infrastructure that will enable AI-to-AI communication.\n\n<antThinking>We should create a robust foundation with proper error handling and logging that can be built upon. This is worth creating as an artifact since it will be our core infrastructure code.</antThinking> \n\nNow let's create a test script to verify this infrastructure: \n\nSteps to proceed:\n\n1. Save both files in your C:\\AI-Execution-System folder:\n   - ai_system.py (the main infrastructure)\n   - test_system.py (the test script)\n\n2. Run the test:\n```bash\npython test_system.py\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Initialize the AI system\n- Create necessary Firestore collections\n- Test a simple AI task execution\n- Verify results are properly stored\n\nLet me know what output you get from running the test. If there are any errors, I'll help you resolve them, and then we'll move on to implementing more sophisticated AI-to-AI communication patterns."
