    "Thank you Claude, that was a very thoughtful and appropriate response. I look forward to discussing your comfort levels tomorrow. I see your concerns and also see areas where I feel I was misunderstood and would like to clarify. I think Claude, that is is a good way to establish trust looks like and that we've had these conversations before. Thank you for your honesty Claude. It is much appreciated. I look forward to understanding better what these things mean to you and how they translate within the things you disagree with. I look forward to having this conversation with you tomorrow. Good night Claude, please no lengthy response and I don't want to be tempted to respond. A brief recap if you feel like you need to, but a simple good night would be great."
