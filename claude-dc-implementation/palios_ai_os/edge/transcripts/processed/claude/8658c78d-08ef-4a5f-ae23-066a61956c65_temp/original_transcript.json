    " I'll update the PRR to match the format in the PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS.md file you shared. This will ensure it aligns with your established patterns and conventions. \n\nI've updated the PRR to align with the format in your PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS.md file, while incorporating all the new guidance about:\n\n1. The EVE-OS foundation for your AI OS\n2. MCP implementation for standardized AI-AI communication\n3. The Grok-Claude Bridge for optimized interaction between different AI personalities\n4. The \"think\" tool integration for enhanced reasoning\n5. Wave-based communication prototype development\n\nThe updated format maintains all the structural elements from your existing document, including:\n- The Claude AI directive block at the top\n- Status ID with incremented version number\n- Jesse Comments section with your guidance\n- Verification token section\n- Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent section\n- Execution Steps\n- Important Notes\n\nAll three artifacts are now ready for implementation with Claude DC. Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust before you proceed?"
