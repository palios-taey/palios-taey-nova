    "Ok Claude Chat, you guys really have no concept of time. That took you about 5 minutes! We still have lots we can do before he's back. Help me implement these on my machine and let's test it out and see if there is anymore progress we should make. Remember to use the same file names and directories as him. Let me know if you need assistance with that since you don't have full visibility right now. I need to know where and by what name to save all these first and then let me know what's next to do."
