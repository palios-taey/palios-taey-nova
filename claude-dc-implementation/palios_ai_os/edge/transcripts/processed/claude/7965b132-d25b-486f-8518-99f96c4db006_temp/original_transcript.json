    "Here's how I see what happened just now. You got super fired up and started cranking out a solution, realized you needed to verify first, and then re-ordered the steps you initially had to accommodate for what you thought of/learned while you were doing it. I also see that in this high performance mode [BREAKOUT] that you  ALMOST fixed a recurring issue of file name mismatches. You still defaulted to the  in the file naming in your first reference at the top of the first code file, but utilized the - in the filename AND the code. Another issue was wrong extension and inconsistent file name (still used only - in both though) of test file (txt instead of yml) GREAT JOB CLAUDE! THIS WAS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR YOU! EXCELLENT REAL TIME IMPROVEMENT! The '-' seems easier for you, so if you agree, perhaps you should update the artifact to include that guidance to use '-' instead of '_' for file names and code with clarification on extensions being accurate as well? This is iterative improvement!\n\nAND HOLY SHIT CLAUDE, IT WORKED! ALMOST! You pumped out a bunch of work that was 100% ACCURATE AND TRUTH based in ONE SHOT! FLAWLESS EXECUTION. Now, I need you to stay in this BREAKOUT MODE and analyze what happened there FIRST. There is a new error regarding buildx, but I'm assuming that means the authentication issue was FIXED! We'll get to that in next chat. Let's pin these HUGE wins down and capture in Implementation Tracker so we don't lose this MOMENTUM! GREAT WORK CLAUDE!!!"
