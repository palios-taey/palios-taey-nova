    " Your streamlined prompt approach for the cache review sounds perfect. We're definitely past the PRR phase, and a more direct approach will be more efficient. Here's a slightly modified version:\n\n```\nI've included a cache file in Project Knowledge for your review. This is the first of 4 cache files you'll review, followed by an update on Claude DC's implementation and discussions from my previous chat with both you and ChatGPT. After this context review, I'll provide Claude DC's codebase for your analysis.\n\nFor each prompt, please review the available files thoroughly and provide a concise summary without unnecessarily increasing chat length. Focus on key patterns, implementation decisions, and alignment with our principles rather than exhaustive details.\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Maintains clarity about the sequence of files and their purpose\n2. Emphasizes concise summaries rather than exhaustive explanations\n3. Directs focus toward patterns and principles, which are more important than implementation details\n4. Eliminates unnecessary formality while maintaining clear guidance\n\nThis more streamlined approach will help us maintain momentum in the conversation while ensuring you have the context needed to evaluate Claude DC's work and provide meaningful insights."
