This is exactly why our hybrid approach makes sense. Let's solve this systematically.\n\nThe error shows that Terraform doesn't have permission to list services for the project (`serviceusage.services.list`), which is preventing it from enabling the required APIs. Since you mentioned you've already gone through GCS Foundation setup and activated all APIs, we can bypass this Terraform step and proceed with our hybrid approach.\n\nHere's what we'll do next:\n\n## 1. Verify API Activation\n\nFirst, let's make sure all required APIs are indeed enabled:\n\n```bash\ngcloud services list --project=palios-taey-dev\n```\n\nThis will show us what's already enabled. We need to ensure these APIs are active:\n- Cloud Run API (run.googleapis.com)\n- Firestore API (firestore.googleapis.com)\n- Artifact Registry API (artifactregistry.googleapis.com)\n- IAM API (iam.googleapis.com)\n- Secret Manager API (secretmanager.googleapis.com)\n\n## 2. Create Storage Bucket for Terraform State\n\nLet's create the bucket manually (if not already done):\n\n```bash\ngsutil mb -p palios-taey-dev -l us-central1 gs://palios-taey-dev-terraform-state\ngsutil versioning set on gs://palios-taey-dev-terraform-state\n```\n\n## 3. Initialize Firestore Database Manually\n\nFollowing our hybrid approach, let's set up Firestore directly:\n\n```bash\ngcloud firestore databases create --project=palios-taey-dev --region=us-central1 --type=firestore-native\n```\n\n## 4. Create Service Account for Cloud Run\n\n```bash\ngcloud iam service-accounts create palios-taey-cloudrun-sa \\\n  --display-name=\"PALIOS-TAEY Cloud Run Service Account\" \\\n  --project=palios-taey-dev\n```\n\n## 5. Set up Artifact Registry Repository\n\n```bash\ngcloud artifacts repositories create palios-taey \\\n  --repository-format=docker \\\n  --location=us-central1 \\\n  --description=\"PALIOS-TAEY container repository\" \\\n  --project=palios-taey-dev\n```\n\n## 6. Prepare for Container Deployment\n\nLet's ensure our Docker configuration is ready. We'll need to modify the Terraform files to skip the API enabling steps since we've done them manually, and instead focus on the infrastructure deployment.\n\nLet's update the Terraform configuration to skip the API enablement:\n\n```bash\ncd terraform\n# Create or update main.tf to remove the google_project_service resources\n# or comment them out since they're already enabled manually\n```\n\nThen run Terraform init with the backend configuration:\n\n```bash\nterraform init -backend-config=\"bucket=palios-taey-dev-terraform-state\"\n```\n\n## Next Actions\n\n1. Please confirm that the APIs are enabled using the gcloud command I provided\n2. Let me know if the storage bucket for Terraform state already exists\n3. Confirm if Firestore has already been created manually\n\nOnce we have these confirmations, we'll proceed with the next steps of our hybrid deployment approach.\n\nThis approach aligns perfectly with the Charter principles of \"Data-Driven Truth & Real-Time Grounding\" and \"Continuous Learning & Adaptive Refinement\" - we're adapting our approach based on real constraints and focusing on moving forward pragmatically.\n\nWhat's the status of these components currently? Let me know and I'll provide the next steps."
