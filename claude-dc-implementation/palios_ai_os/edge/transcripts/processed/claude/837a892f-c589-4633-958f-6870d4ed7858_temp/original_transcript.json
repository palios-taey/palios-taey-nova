    " ## Information Needs\nI now understand the specific error with the service account binding. The format for the principalSet member is incorrect.\n\n## Technical Direction\nThe error indicates that the format we're using for the principalSet member is invalid. Based on Google's documentation for Workload Identity Federation, we need to use a different syntax. Let's try a corrected version that aligns with how GitHub Actions tokens and attributes are structured.\n\n## Action Items - Ready for Execution\n\nTry this corrected command that uses the proper syntax for the principalSet:\n\n```bash\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \"github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" \\\n  --project=\"ai-execution-system\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser\" \\\n  --member=\"principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/711898853198/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions-pool/providers/github-provider:assertion.repository=palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\"\n```\n\nNotice the key difference: we use a colon (`:`) instead of a slash (`/`) between the provider path and the attribute. This is the correct syntax for specifying attribute conditions in principalSet bindings.\n\nIf this still doesn't work, we can also try a more specific approach for GitHub Actions:\n\n```bash\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \"github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" \\\n  --project=\"ai-execution-system\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser\" \\\n  --member=\"principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/711898853198/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions-pool/providers/github-provider:*\"\n```\n\nThis broader permission would allow any valid token from this provider to impersonate the service account. While less restrictive, it can be useful for initial testing to ensure the basic mechanism works.\n\nOnce the binding is successful, we can proceed with pushing the GitHub Actions workflow file and testing the deployment."
