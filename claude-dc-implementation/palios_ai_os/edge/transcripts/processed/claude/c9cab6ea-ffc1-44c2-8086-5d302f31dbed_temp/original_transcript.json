    " ## Information Needs\nI understand we're hitting roadblocks with the command line approach for setting up service account bindings. Let's switch to using the Google Cloud Console for this step.\n\n## Technical Direction\nThe command line syntax for Workload Identity Federation is proving difficult. Google Cloud Console provides a more user-friendly interface for this configuration. We can use the IAM page to set up the binding visually, which is less error-prone than trying different command syntaxes.\n\n## Action Items - Ready for Execution\n\n### 1. Set up the service account binding using Google Cloud Console:\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n2. Navigate to \"IAM & Admin\" > \"Service Accounts\"\n3. Find and click on \"github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"\n4. Click on the \"PERMISSIONS\" tab\n5. Click \"+ GRANT ACCESS\"\n6. In the \"New principals\" field, enter the following:\n   ```\n   principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/711898853198/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions-pool/providers/github-provider\n   ```\n7. For the role, search for and select \"Workload Identity User\"\n8. Click \"SAVE\"\n\nThis approach uses the web interface to avoid syntax errors with the command line.\n\n### 2. After setting up the binding, create a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to test:\n\nOnce you've set up the binding through the console, save the GitHub workflow file that I provided earlier (`.github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudrun.yml`), commit it to your repository, and push to the main branch. This will trigger the workflow and test our authentication setup.\n\nIf we need to restrict the binding to only your specific repository later, we can add that after confirming the basic authentication works."
