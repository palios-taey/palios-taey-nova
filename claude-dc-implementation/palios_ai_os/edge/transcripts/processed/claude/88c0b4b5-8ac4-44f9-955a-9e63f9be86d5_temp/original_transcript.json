    "Ok, I completed the first step in app.py and updated that file in project knowledge. I added secrets.py to project knowledge. I think we already addressed this in there, but I'm not sure if Claude DC referenced this in his code at all. It seems like he implemented all new code and did not utilize any existing modules or code, but I don't know, did he reference anything previously created in his new files? After reviewing that file and the code, let me know what we need to do while minimizing steps for me to save time and reduce human errors."
