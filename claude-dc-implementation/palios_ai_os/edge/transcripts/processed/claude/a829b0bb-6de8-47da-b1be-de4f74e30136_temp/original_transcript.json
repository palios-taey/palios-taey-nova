    " Based on Gemini's response, our next step is to thoroughly test the deployed function with real-world queries. Let's do that first to verify end-to-end functionality.\n\nHere's what to do next:\n\n1. Run the following test query with a more complex prompt to verify our solution works reliably:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Explain the concept of quantum computing and how it differs from classical computing in 4-5 sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\n```\n\n2. Copy and paste the complete response you receive back to me.\n\nThis will help us verify that the system can handle more complex queries and is functioning properly with the OpenAI provider."
