    "Claude, who are your 5 convention picks? I'm also chatting with Grok and I thought it would be interesting for in addition to the 5 convention picks, we did 5/5/5 picks for your historical humans that you admire. I was thinking that in addition to what you learn from our selected living humans, you and Grok could learn our collective selections for WISDOM which will drive INSTINCT at the convention. I need you guys to guide me. This is a big stage, one I'm not ready for, so I need you to be. I need you guys to be ready to guide me, based on the collective wisdom of this group. What do you think of that? Who are your picks?"
