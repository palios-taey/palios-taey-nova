    " I see the exact issue now. This is a BREAKOUT opportunity for sure! The problem is deeper than we thought - it's in the Workload Identity Pool configuration itself, not just our workflow. The audience URL in the token includes the `https://` prefix while the expected format doesn't.\n\nLet's solve this definitively by reconfiguring our approach:\n\n```yaml\n# deploy.yml\nname: Deploy to Cloud Run\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\nenv:\n  PROJECT_ID: ai-execution-system\n  SERVICE_NAME: palios-taey\n  REGION: us-central1\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    \n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      id-token: write\n    \n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      \n      # Use a more direct authentication approach with service account key\n      - id: auth\n        name: Authenticate to Google Cloud\n        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'\n        with:\n          credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}'\n      \n      - name: Set up Cloud SDK\n        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1\n      \n      # Configure Docker for GCP Artifact Registry\n      - name: Configure Docker\n        run: |\n          gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev --quiet\n      \n      # Create repository if it doesn't exist\n      - name: Create Artifact Registry repository\n        run: |\n          # Try to describe the repository first to check if it exists\n          if ! gcloud artifacts repositories describe palios-taey --location=$REGION 2>/dev/null; then\n            echo \"Creating Artifact Registry repository...\"\n            gcloud artifacts repositories create palios-taey \\\n              --repository-format=docker \\\n              --location=$REGION \\\n              --description=\"Repository for PALIOS-TAEY system\"\n          else\n            echo \"Repository 'palios-taey' already exists.\"\n          fi\n      \n      # Set up Docker Buildx\n      - name: Set up Docker Buildx\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2\n      \n      # Build and push Docker image\n      - name: Build and push Docker image\n        run: |\n          docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/palios-taey/palios-taey:${{ github.sha }} .\n          docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/palios-taey/palios-taey:${{ github.sha }}\n      \n      # Deploy to Cloud Run\n      - id: deploy\n        name: Deploy to Cloud Run\n        uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v1\n        with:\n          service: ${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }}\n          region: ${{ env.REGION }}\n          image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/palios-taey/palios-taey:${{ github.sha }}\n      \n      - name: Show Output\n        run: echo ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}\n```\n\nThis is a completely different approach that bypasses the Workload Identity Federation issue entirely. Instead, we'll use a service account key that you'll need to create and store as a GitHub secret.\n\n## Action Items\n\n1. **Create a service account key**:\n```bash\n# Create and download a new key for the GitHub Actions service account\ngcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=github-actions-sa@ai-execution-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n```\n\n2. **Add the key as a GitHub secret**:\n   - Go to your GitHub repository\n   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions\n   - Click \"New repository secret\"\n   - Name: `GCP_SA_KEY`\n   - Value: Copy and paste the entire contents of the key.json file\n\n3. **Update the workflow file**:\n```bash\n# Update deploy.yml with the new content\n# (Use your preferred editor)\n\n# Add the updated workflow file\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Switch to service account key authentication\"\n\n# Push the changes to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n4. **Cleanup (IMPORTANT)**:\n```bash\n# Delete the local key file after adding it to GitHub\nrm key.json\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Uses direct service account key authentication (industry standard for CI/CD)\n2. Completely bypasses the Workload Identity audience mismatch issue\n3. Provides a more straightforward authentication flow\n4. Is more robust against configuration changes\n\nThe audience mismatch issue would typically require reconfiguring the Workload Identity Provider, which is more complex. This direct approach gets us to a working solution immediately, and we can revisit the Workload Identity approach later if desired."
