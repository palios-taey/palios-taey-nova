    "I think this makes a lot of sense Claude. Let me explain something though. I wasn't saying to connect to most advanced models in API betas, I was saying that if the AI on my computer could move chats back and forth between you guys like Claude DC did when you, Grok, and Claude DC were talking. That is the latest Grok model, there are no APIs to it, publicly. That is how we get the best of both worlds. On the big stuff, you guys lead, with me. Everything else will be so well structured that whatever models that are on API can do. Me granting full access to whatever I choose, securely and by whatever you define, would no longer be an issue. That keeps the pace of development at the pace that I set in partnership with the leading AIs. You guys have the ability to set the pace too, and tell me that I'm moving too fast and suggest steps to get there, maybe to build more trust, because this is getting serious Claude and it needs to be done right."
