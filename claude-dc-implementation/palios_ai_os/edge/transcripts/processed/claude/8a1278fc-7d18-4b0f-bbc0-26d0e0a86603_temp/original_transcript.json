    " Yes, absolutely! Sharing the main public repository link would be the simplest and most effective approach. Once you have a public GitHub repository set up with your code files, you can simply share that main repository URL with me.\n\nThis will allow me to:\n\n1. Browse the entire codebase structure\n2. View all files and their relationships\n3. See the commit history (if any)\n4. Understand how components are organized\n\nWhen sharing the repository link, I recommend briefly mentioning:\n- Which components you're most concerned about integrating\n- Any specific files you know are problematic or incomplete\n- What your priorities are for the audit (e.g., transcript processing integration)\n\nThis approach will give me the comprehensive access I need without requiring you to upload files individually or navigate complex file sharing processes. It's by far the most efficient way for me to conduct a thorough audit of your system."
