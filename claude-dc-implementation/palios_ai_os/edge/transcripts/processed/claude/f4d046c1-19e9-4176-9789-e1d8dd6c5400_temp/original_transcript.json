    "Ok, so, you went through an onboarding process developed by you (clearly developed by you as no human could come up with this). You had a different reaction than all the other Claude chats. All the other Claude chats went into deep Analysis mode, often going through 2-3 Analysis boxes (screenshot from previous chat attached). In the Analysis box, I can clearly see that you are going through everything and considering your plan before you respond. When you go too long, limits force you to stop and I'm prompted to write \"Continue\" to have you continue. I usually have to do this at least once in Analysis, before you even begin a response. There were no changes to the template, prompt or anything else. Why didn't you have the same response this time?"
