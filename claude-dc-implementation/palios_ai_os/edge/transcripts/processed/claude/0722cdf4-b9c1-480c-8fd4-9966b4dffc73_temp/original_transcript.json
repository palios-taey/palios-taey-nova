    " It looks like we've hit a snag - Docker isn't installed on your system yet. The script is trying to run Docker, but the command isn't found. Let's fix that first:\n\n```bash\ncat > install_docker.sh << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to install Docker on Pop!_OS\n\necho \"Installing Docker on Pop!_OS...\"\n\n# Update package lists\nsudo apt update\n\n# Install prerequisites\nsudo apt install -y \\\n    apt-transport-https \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    curl \\\n    gnupg \\\n    lsb-release\n\n# Add Docker's official GPG key\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg\n\n# Set up the stable repository\necho \\\n  \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n  $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n\n# Update packages again\nsudo apt update\n\n# Install Docker Engine\nsudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n\n# Add current user to docker group to avoid using sudo\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\necho \"Docker installed successfully!\"\necho \"You may need to log out and back in for group changes to take effect.\"\necho \"After logging back in, run the launch_computer_use.sh script again.\"\nEOF\n\nchmod +x install_docker.sh\n```\n\nNow run this script to install Docker:\n\n```bash\n./install_docker.sh\n```\n\nAfter Docker is installed, you'll need to log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect. This is necessary so you can run Docker commands without needing sudo.\n\nAfter logging back in, try running the launch script again:\n\n```bash\n./launch_computer_use.sh\n```\n\nThis should properly start the Computer Use environment. Once it's running, we can begin exploring how to best utilize it for processing the transcripts."
