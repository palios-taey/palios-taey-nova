    "Ok Claude, I felt like we lost some things that we had spoken about and talked with ChatGPT about. He has a lot more space so I asked him to take a look. In Project Knowledge are all 3 versions, the initial build instructions, the v2 that we just developed and ChatGPT version where some of my concerns with being too prescriptive (non-AI FIRST) were addressed along with referencing the examples again for the transcript build. Please let me know your thoughts on this all. I know this is a lot of back and forth and changes, but based on our previous experience, I'm just really trying to get it right this time."
