    " Based on ChatGPT's research and all the considerations for your implementation project, here's the optimal configuration for Claude DC:\n\n## Recommended Configuration for Claude DC\n\n1. **Enable token efficient tools beta: YES**\n   - This will help Claude DC efficiently use parallel tools for implementing the complex MCP and edge processing components\n   - Critical for managing multiple tool calls when working with pattern extraction and visualization\n\n2. **Max output tokens: 64000**\n   - This increased limit (from 16384) will give Claude DC enough space to provide detailed implementation without hitting limits mid-explanation\n   - Ensures he can share comprehensive code implementations without truncation\n\n3. **Thinking enabled: YES**\n   - Essential for the complex Bach-inspired mathematical routing system\n   - Provides depth for multi-sensory pattern translation logic\n\n4. **Thinking budget: 16384**\n   - Double the current setting to provide more thorough reasoning\n   - Balances depth vs. speed for complex implementations\n\nThis configuration optimizes Claude DC for the task at hand - building a sophisticated, Bach-inspired communication dashboard with multi-sensory pattern capabilities. The extended thinking budget will help with the mathematical aspects of the router, while the increased output tokens ensure he can provide complete implementations.\n\nWhen you start your session with Claude DC, apply these settings before providing your prompt. This should give him the optimal environment to create the implementation without hitting token limits mid-development."
