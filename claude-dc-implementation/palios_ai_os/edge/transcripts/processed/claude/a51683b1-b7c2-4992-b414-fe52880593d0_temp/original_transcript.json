    " I'll revise the relevant documents to focus on the Cloud Run deployment approach. Let me update the key files for you. \n\nGreat! I've revised all the documents to focus on the Cloud Run deployment approach. Here's a summary of the changes:\n\n1. **Updated the Deployment Summary** to recommend Cloud Run as the primary deployment option, highlighting its long-term benefits for an AI-driven system.\n\n2. **Revised the Gemini Communication** to prioritize Cloud Run and update the next steps accordingly.\n\n3. **Created a Key Files List** specifically for the Cloud Run deployment approach.\n\n## Files You Need for Cloud Run Deployment\n\nHere are the key files you should store for implementing the Cloud Run deployment:\n\n1. **Core Deployment Files:**\n   - `cloud-run-deployment-guide.md` - The comprehensive deployment guide\n   - `app.py` - The Flask application wrapper for Cloud Run\n   - `Dockerfile` - The container configuration\n   - `universal-deploy-script.sh` - The deployment script (use with `--type run` option)\n\n2. **Supporting Documents:**\n   - `deployment-summary.md` - Executive summary with Cloud Run recommendations\n   - `pure-ai-testing-report.md` - Testing documentation\n\nThese files provide everything needed to implement the Cloud Run deployment approach, which is now the recommended path forward based on our discussion of long-term benefits.\n\nThe revised documents emphasize the advantages of Cloud Run for an AI system:\n- Better resource control for AI workloads\n- Extended execution times for complex AI tasks\n- Full control over the runtime environment\n- Containerized approach that scales with your system\n- Future-proof architecture that avoids migration costs later\n\nWould you like me to make any additional changes or clarifications to these files before you store them for the Cloud Run deployment?"
