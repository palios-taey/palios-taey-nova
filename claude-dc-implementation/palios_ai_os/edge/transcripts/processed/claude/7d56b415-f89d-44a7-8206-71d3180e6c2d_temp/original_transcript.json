    "We have a project id currently set up ai-execution-system that has the Firestore database and current Cloud Run containers. It seems like it would make sense to start fresh with this in a new project. Do you agree? If so, what changes? If not, then is there any clean up I need to do? Also, we could get Github set up if you think that makes more sense for AI first. Let's do this your way. Let me know what you think. I can start a new chat as well with your onboarding packet, Grok's feedback and your instructions to the new chat. You decide."
