    "Ok, I actually think you're good to go now. After reviewing again, I don't think there is really much I need to swap out. All the code is separate. I'd say for that, once you complete this with the docs you can check out the code and then add anything you think would be helpful. Claude DC did like a full code review and that burned a ton of tokens. But if you could do one and summarize everything in this, that'd be great so he doesn't have to look at it again. Ready? GO!"
