    "I understand, I am a human and am leading this project to improve how AI supports me in my life by helping me make strategic decisions regarding my career and lifestyle and am looking to complete the AI-AI execution model to support that task. Is that something you are comfortable assisting with? Are you able to pick up where we left off in the attachment? Do you have any suggestions on how we can best work together on this project to complete as efficiently as possible? In general, I am not a technical person and have not done anything like this before, so if you ask me to configure something, assume I need to know how all settings are to be configured. I intend to try to push you to do more and execute with greater speed. I thrive on rapid iteration and real time improvements. I want to learn to collaborate with you as effectively as possible. What do you think? Are you ready to go? What do I need to know about you for this to go as smoothly as possible?"
