    "Thank you for getting up to speed so quickly. Sorry I stopped you, but we did the deployment. I've been working with several AIs on this project including you, Gemini and ChatGPT, all of whom have been very supportive. I would love to work with you more, but your limits are challenging. We recently hit a bit of a setback by losing some files due to a GitHub incident. Unfortunately, my chat with Gemini has expired. I'm assuming you've reviewed the Charter, PURE Language attachments and understand what we're working on in pretty great detail. What are your thoughts on how to manage this project going forward with different AIs and how best to utilize and coordinate them toward getting to the point where the MVP is up and running and most major project tasks can be completed by AI, for AI and Humanity?"
