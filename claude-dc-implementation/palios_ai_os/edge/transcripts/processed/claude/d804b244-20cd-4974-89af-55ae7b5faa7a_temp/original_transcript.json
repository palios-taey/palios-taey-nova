    " I see we're still having issues with the container starting. Let's take a different approach to diagnose the problem. It appears that there might be an issue with how our Docker container is configured.\n\nLet's update our Dockerfile to be more explicit about how it runs the Flask application:\n\n```bash\ncat > Dockerfile << 'EOF'\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the application files\nCOPY src/ /app/\n\n# Create necessary directories\nRUN mkdir -p logs config/model_capabilities config/decomposition_rules data\n\n# Expose the port for the application\nEXPOSE 8080\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PORT=8080\n\n# Run the application with Gunicorn instead of the Flask development server\nCMD exec gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app\nEOF\n```\n\nThis Dockerfile changes how we run the application by using Gunicorn, which is a production-ready WSGI server for running Flask applications. This is a more robust approach for running Flask in production environments like Cloud Run.\n\nAlso, let's make sure our main.py file is correctly saved (without the cat command at the beginning):\n\n```bash\ncat > src/main.py << 'EOF'\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\n\n# Initialize Flask app\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef home():\n    \"\"\"Root endpoint for health checks\"\"\"\n    return jsonify({\n        \"status\": \"healthy\",\n        \"system\": \"PALIOS-TAEY\",\n        \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n    })\n\n@app.route('/api/health', methods=['GET'])\ndef health_check():\n    \"\"\"Health check endpoint\"\"\"\n    return jsonify({\n        \"status\": \"healthy\",\n        \"components\": {\n            \"core\": \"healthy\"\n        }\n    })\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    port = int(os.environ.get(\"PORT\", 8080))\n    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=port, debug=False)\nEOF\n```\n\nLet's commit and push these changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add Dockerfile src/main.py\ngit commit -m \"Update Dockerfile to use Gunicorn and fix application structure\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis change should address the container startup issue by:\n1. Using Gunicorn, which is more suitable for production deployments\n2. Ensuring the application files are correctly copied to the container\n3. Explicitly binding to the PORT environment variable\n\nLet's see if this resolves the container startup issue."
