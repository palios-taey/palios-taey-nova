    " I understand the situation. To handle the permission issues, we'll adjust our approach to use your account with full permissions directly. This is a pragmatic solution given that you're the only human involved, and we can refine the security setup later.\n\nLet's update our deployment strategy to use your email directly and bypass service account complexities: \n\nThis updated deployment script:\n\n1. Uses your email account (`jesse@taey.ai`) directly instead of service accounts\n2. Grants your account Owner role to ensure no more permission issues\n3. Creates and uses Artifact Registry instead of Container Registry (gcr.io)\n4. Configures Docker to use Artifact Registry\n5. Builds and pushes the Docker image directly\n6. Deploys to Cloud Run with your account's permissions\n\nTo implement this plan:\n\n1. Create the updated deployment script in the root directory:\n   ```bash\n   vim deploy_direct.sh  # or use your preferred editor\n   ```\n\n2. Paste the script content from above\n\n3. Make the script executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x deploy_direct.sh\n   ```\n\n4. Run the deployment script:\n   ```bash\n   ./deploy_direct.sh\n   ```\n\nThe script handles all necessary permissions by granting your email account full access to all required resources. This approach bypasses the service account complexities until you can configure it properly with your Ubuntu machine.\n\nIf you encounter any specific error messages during the process, let me know, and I'll help you troubleshoot them."
