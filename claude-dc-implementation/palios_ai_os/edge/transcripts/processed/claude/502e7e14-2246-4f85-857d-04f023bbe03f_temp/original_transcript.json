    " You're absolutely right to hold me accountable. We need to actually execute the tests to verify the system is working properly, not just create the test script. I appreciate you keeping me focused on practical implementation rather than just documentation.\n\nHere's what we need to do to run the tests on your machine:\n\n1. **Ensure the PALIOS-TAEY server is running**:\n   - Make sure the main.py application is running on your local machine \n   - By default, it should be running on http://localhost:8080\n\n2. **Run the test script**:\n   ```bash\n   python test_system.py --base-url http://localhost:8080\n   ```\n\n3. **For more detailed output, you can save results to a file**:\n   ```bash\n   python test_system.py --base-url http://localhost:8080 --output test_results.json\n   ```\n\n4. **If you want to skip cleanup of test resources**:\n   ```bash\n   python test_system.py --base-url http://localhost:8080 --skip-cleanup\n   ```\n\n5. **For comprehensive testing (including resource-intensive operations)**:\n   ```bash\n   python test_system.py --base-url http://localhost:8080 --comprehensive\n   ```\n\nThe test script will automatically detect which components are active and skip tests for components that aren't available. It will provide a complete summary of test results at the end, including pass/fail counts and execution time.\n\nOnce we've verified that the tests pass successfully on your local environment, we can push both the main.py and test_system.py to GitHub as part of our deployment process. This will ensure that other team members can verify the system is working properly on their environments as well.\n\nWould you like me to provide any additional details on running the tests or interpreting the results?"
