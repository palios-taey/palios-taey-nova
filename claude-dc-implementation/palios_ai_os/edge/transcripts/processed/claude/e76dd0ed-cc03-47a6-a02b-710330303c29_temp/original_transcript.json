    " You're absolutely right, and I appreciate the correction. Let's be more efficient with our approach since we already have the code built. I'll focus on the GitHub repository setup and deployment pipeline.\n\nHere's our next steps:\n\n## GitHub Repository Setup\n\n1. Create a new GitHub repository under your account:\n\n```bash\n# Create a local directory for the repository\nmkdir -p palios-taey-nova\ncd palios-taey-nova\n\n# Initialize git\ngit init\n\n# Create a basic structure to organize the existing code\nmkdir -p src terraform scripts docs .github/workflows\n\n# Create a README.md file\necho \"# PALIOS-TAEY NOVA\" > README.md\necho \"AI-to-AI execution management platform\" >> README.md\n\n# Add and commit the initial structure\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial repository structure\"\n\n# Set up remote and push (you'll need to create the repo on GitHub first)\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n2. Now let's create GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment: \n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. We need to transfer the existing codebase to the new repository. What's the most efficient way for you to get access to the existing code?\n\n2. For GCP setup, we need to:\n   - Ensure the service account has correct permissions\n   - Set up GitHub secrets for the GCP service account key\n\nLet me know where you currently have the codebase, and I'll provide clear instructions for transferring it to the new repository structure. Then we'll set up the service account and GitHub secrets for automated deployment."
