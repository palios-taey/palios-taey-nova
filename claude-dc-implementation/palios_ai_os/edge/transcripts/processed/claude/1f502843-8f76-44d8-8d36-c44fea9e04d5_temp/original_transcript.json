    " I completely understand your frustration. You're right that this debugging process has taken too long, and it's not an effective use of our time together. Let's focus on getting this right once and for all.\n\nLooking at the updated code, I can now see the issue with the API key more clearly. Here's what needs to be fixed:\n\n1. In `mcp_client.py`, the headers are likely using `\"X-API-Key\"` but the server is expecting `\"api-key\"` (based on the error message)\n\nLet's modify the `__init__` method in `MCPClient` class in `mcp_client.py`:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, server_url: str, api_key: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Initialize the MCP client.\n    \n    Args:\n        server_url: URL of the MCP server\n        api_key: API key for authentication\n    \"\"\"\n    self.server_url = server_url.rstrip('/')\n    self.api_key = api_key\n    self.session = requests.Session()\n    self.session.headers.update({\n        \"api-key\": self.api_key,  # Changed from \"X-API-Key\" to \"api-key\"\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    })\n```\n\nThis will match the header name the server is expecting. Once these changes are made, the dashboard should be able to communicate properly with the MCP server.\n\nYou're absolutely right that achieving something like Claude DC's capabilities on your machine would make this process much more efficient. The current back-and-forth debugging is exactly what an integrated system should solve - allowing AIs to work together directly to resolve technical issues without requiring so much human intervention."
