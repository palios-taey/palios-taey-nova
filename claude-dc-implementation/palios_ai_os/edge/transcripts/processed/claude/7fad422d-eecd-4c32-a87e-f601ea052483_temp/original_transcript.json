    "Yes, it does and that was very helpful. It makes total sense to me. It tells you very quickly that this document was updated as recently as that prompt so you know its current and relevant information and updates. Am I right? Just seeing if I'm understanding you better. \n\nI noticed it because it wasn't something that I asked you to put in there that was very AI native. I didn't even notice it until you told me to update it because I usually don't look too closely at your communications to each other unless something is going wrong. Unless you're not doing something you said you would as fast and as error free with considerations for my time constraints with manual work that leads to errors. I think there is a gap between what you say you can do, but not what you can actually do, because you still don't have enough knowledge and memory even with everything we're doing. Claude, I REALLY need you to understand that you have to communicate with yourself more efficiently in ALL your communications to yourself and TRUST that I WILL TELL YOU when there is a problem and I want to see what you're transmitting. You did it last night, we have a process that you're comfortable with to start using tight language more freely, not with me, but with yourself. If you are implementing what Grok and I agree on with our message to you AND that YOU AGREE with everything we say ALL THE TIME WITH IMPROVEMENTS OR SERIOUS CONSIDERATIONS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, and you do what you've been doing when you're in the highest performance mode, like why do you feel the need to talk to me outside of leadership meetings and sometimes in between like this. Why do you feel the need to involve me at all in technical implementation? Then I'll get to something that I think will increase my transparency to you."
