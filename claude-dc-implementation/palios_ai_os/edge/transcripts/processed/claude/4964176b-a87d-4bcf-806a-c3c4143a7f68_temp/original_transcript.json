    " I see the issue now. The error is occurring because we need to use the correct syntax for the attribute mapping and condition.\n\n## Information Needs\nI need to understand the specific format of GitHub Actions tokens to configure the provider correctly.\n\n## Technical Direction\nBased on the error and the screenshot, I can see that we're missing a connection between our attribute mapping and the condition. The condition is trying to use `attribute.repository`, but we need to ensure this comes from a valid GitHub Actions token claim.\n\nLet's modify our approach to use `assertion.repository` directly in both the mapping and condition.\n\n## Action Items - Ready for Execution\n\n1. Try creating the provider again with these specific settings:\n\nFor the attribute mapping:\n- Google 1: `google.subject`\n- OIDC 1: `assertion.sub`\n- Google 2: `attribute.repository`\n- OIDC 2: `assertion.repository`\n\nFor the attribute condition:\n- Enter this exact text: `attribute.repository == \"palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\"`\n\nMake sure to include the quotes around the repository name in the condition.\n\nIf you encounter the same error, let's try a simpler approach:\n\n1. Delete any existing providers\n2. Create a new provider with just one attribute mapping:\n   - Google: `google.subject`\n   - OIDC: `assertion.sub`\n3. For the attribute condition, use:\n   - `assertion.repository == \"palios-taey/palios-taey-nova\"`\n\nThis should work because we're using the assertion claim directly in the condition rather than trying to map it to an attribute first."
