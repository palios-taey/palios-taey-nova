    " It looks like Terraform is still trying to access a remote backend storage bucket despite our attempts to disable it. Let's use a more direct approach:\n\n1. **Create a completely new main.tf** file without any backend configuration:\n\n```bash\ncat > main.tf.new <<EOF\n# main.tf - Main Terraform configuration for PALIOS-TAEY infrastructure\n\nterraform {\n  required_version = \">= 1.0.0\"\n  required_providers {\n    google = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/google\"\n      version = \"~> 4.80.0\"\n    }\n    google-beta = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/google-beta\"\n      version = \"~> 4.80.0\"\n    }\n  }\n  # No backend configuration here\n}\n\nprovider \"google\" {\n  project = var.project_id\n  region  = var.region\n  zone    = var.zone\n}\n\nprovider \"google-beta\" {\n  project = var.project_id\n  region  = var.region\n  zone    = var.zone\n}\n\n# Configure project metadata for organization info\nresource \"google_compute_project_metadata_item\" \"project_metadata\" {\n  project = var.project_id\n  key     = \"palios-taey-infrastructure-version\"\n  value   = \"1.0.0\"\n}\n\n# Set up resource locations and defaults\nresource \"google_project_default_service_accounts\" \"default\" {\n  project = var.project_id\n  action  = \"DISABLE\"\n}\nEOF\n\nmv main.tf.new main.tf\n```\n\n2. **Completely start over with Terraform initialization**:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf .terraform\nrm -f .terraform.lock.hcl\nterraform init\n```\n\n3. **Run the plan again**:\n\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```\n\nIf we're still encountering issues, we may need to consider an alternative approach, such as manually setting up the infrastructure components through the Google Cloud Console rather than trying to automate everything with Terraform at this stage."
