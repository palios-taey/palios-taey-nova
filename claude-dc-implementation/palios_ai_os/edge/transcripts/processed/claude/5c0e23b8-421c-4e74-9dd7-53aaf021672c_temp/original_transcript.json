    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\nStatus: I've successfully diagnosed the import path issue in the main.py file causing deployment failures, and provided a fix to update the import statements to use package-relative paths.\nRepository: I've reviewed the full codebase including the error logs in current-execution-status/error-logs.md which showed a \"TypeError: FastAPI.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'send'\" suggesting issues with FastAPI/Gunicorn integration.\nStructure: The critical issue is in how the FastAPI app is initialized and how Gunicorn is being configured to serve the application in the Dockerfile.\nDependencies: This task relates to successfully deploying our enhanced MVP with properly configured server components.\n\nVERIFICATION:\nCurrent Token: WH7DXKR96S | 2025-03-19T01:28:45Z\nNext Token: LM5QTGV82C | 2025-03-19T01:42:19Z\n\nAfter examining the error logs more carefully, I've identified a deeper issue. The error \"FastAPI.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'send'\" indicates a mismatch between how we're trying to serve the application with Gunicorn and how FastAPI expects to be run.\n\nThis is a known issue with FastAPI when used with Gunicorn directly. The problem is in the Dockerfile's CMD instruction, which is trying to run FastAPI with Gunicorn without the necessary ASGI server interface.\n\nLet me perform a comprehensive analysis of what's happening:\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe fundamental issue is with how we're serving the FastAPI application:\n\n1. FastAPI is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) framework\n2. Gunicorn by itself doesn't natively support ASGI\n3. We need an ASGI server like Uvicorn to act as a worker for Gunicorn\n\nLooking at our Dockerfile's CMD:\n```\nCMD exec gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 'src.main:app'\n```\n\nThis tries to run FastAPI directly with Gunicorn without the necessary ASGI adapter, which causes the error.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe need to modify the Dockerfile to use Uvicorn workers with Gunicorn. Let's update the Dockerfile:\n\n```bash\ncat > Dockerfile << 'EOF'\nFROM python:3.10-slim\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Create necessary directories\nRUN mkdir -p logs config src/palios_taey\n\n# Copy requirements first for better layer caching\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the application code\nCOPY src/ src/\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PORT=8080\nENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\nENV ENVIRONMENT=production\nENV USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=true\n\n# Expose the port\nEXPOSE 8080\n\n# Start the application using Uvicorn workers with Gunicorn\nCMD exec gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --threads 8 --timeout 0 'src.main:app'\nEOF\n```\n\nThe key change is adding `--worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` which tells Gunicorn to use Uvicorn's ASGI worker class. This provides the proper interface between Gunicorn and FastAPI.\n\nWe should also ensure that Uvicorn is in our requirements.txt:\n\n```bash\ncat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'\nfastapi>=0.95.0\npydantic>=2.0.0\nuvicorn>=0.20.0\ngunicorn>=20.1.0\ngoogle-cloud-storage>=2.0.0\ngoogle-cloud-firestore>=2.0.0\nEOF\n```\n\nWith these changes, the application should deploy successfully. I recommend now:\n\n1. Running the cleanup script first to ensure a clean codebase\n2. Updating the Dockerfile and requirements.txt with these changes\n3. Proceeding with the deployment\n\nThis should fix both the import path issues and the FastAPI/Gunicorn integration problems, allowing the application to deploy and run successfully on Cloud Run."
