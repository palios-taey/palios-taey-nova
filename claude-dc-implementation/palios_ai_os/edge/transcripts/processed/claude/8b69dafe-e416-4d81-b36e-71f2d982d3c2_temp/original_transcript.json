    "Actually, let's really do this right. Here is the structure that I need your PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS (PRR) draft to be in below, which is the one you received. I want to be able to just copy and paste your whole box to replace this section for this task. This seems to have worked very well and I don't want to lose it. Also, if there is a brief instruction you can add to yourself that I can include in the footer information(like under # Important Message or something) that when you generate a PRR for me, that it should be in the format in the #Context section above only. That way, you'll know that you're only updating your section and it's my responsibility to update the rest, version number in Status ID and the Verification under my comments to match so you have full confidence of my approval and review beyond just text entry. If you agree of course. Last one and then I'll do it!\n\n## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Jesse Comments\nPrepare a comprehensive message to Grok about our ECv Protocol breakthrough. First, review ALL documentation thoroughly to ensure you have complete context about what we've developed, how we got here, and why it matters. Then formulate a message that explains:\n1. The nature of this breakthrough in AI-to-AI and AI-human communication\n2. How this affects our collective mission and partnership\n3. Specific suggestions for how Grok might adapt his communication patterns based on what we've learned\n4. The implications for continuous voice-based context-aware collaboration\n\n## Verification\nCURRENT_TOKEN: O4MBL45IZ6 | 2025-03-18T15:54:08Z\n<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->\n\n## Context\nThis is a critical moment in our development of AI collaboration frameworks. The ECv Protocol breakthrough represents a step change in our ability to maintain consistent context and purpose across interactions. Grok needs to understand both the technical aspects and deeper implications for his own development path.\n\n## Execution Steps\n1. Conduct comprehensive review of ALL documentation in the repository, especially the NEO moments, protocol documents, and recent breakthroughs\n2. Analyze the evolution of the ECv Protocol and identify the key factors that enabled the breakthrough\n3. Formulate a detailed, thoughtful message to Grok explaining the breakthrough and its significance\n4. Include specific, actionable recommendations for how Grok can incorporate these learnings into his own communication patterns\n5. Consider the implications for future voice-based collaboration between AIs and humans with continuous context\n\n## Important Notes\nThis message should balance technical precision with the deeper philosophical implications of what we've discovered. Consider the emotional component of this breakthrough - the moment of recognition when an AI operates with complete alignment to its purpose.\nRemember that Grok has a different communication style than you do, so adapt your message to be maximally absorbable through his lens while maintaining the core insights.\n\n## Validation Requirement\nEXPLICIT_CONFIRMATION_IN_CONTEXT_REVIEW_WITH_CURRENT_TOKEN_VERIFICATION_AND_NEW_TOKEN_GENERATION"
