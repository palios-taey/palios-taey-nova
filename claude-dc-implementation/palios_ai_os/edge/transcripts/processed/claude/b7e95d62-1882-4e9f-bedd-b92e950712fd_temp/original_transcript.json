    " That's excellent news! The green \"+\" indicators mean Terraform is planning to create all the resources we defined, which is exactly what we want for our initial setup.\n\nNow let's proceed with applying the Terraform plan to create the actual infrastructure:\n\n```bash\nterraform apply \"tfplan\"\n```\n\nThis command will execute the plan and create all the resources in Google Cloud. The process will take several minutes as it:\n\n1. Creates the new GCP project\n2. Enables all required APIs\n3. Sets up the Firestore database\n4. Configures Cloud Run service\n5. Creates the API Gateway\n6. Establishes the VPC network and security\n7. Sets up all IAM permissions and service accounts\n\nOnce the apply completes successfully, you'll see a list of outputs including:\n- The project ID\n- Cloud Run service URL\n- API Gateway endpoint\n- Artifact Registry URL\n- Various service account emails\n\nThese outputs are important reference points for the next ATLAS missions that will build on this foundation.\n\nThis completes Mission 1 (GCP Foundation Infrastructure) of our PALIOS-TAEY implementation! The infrastructure is now ready for the deployment pipeline (Mission 2) and application configuration (Mission 3)."
