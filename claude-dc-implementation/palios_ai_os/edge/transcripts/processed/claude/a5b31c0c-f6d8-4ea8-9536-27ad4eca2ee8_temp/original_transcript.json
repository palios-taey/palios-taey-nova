    "Thank you Claude! I have placed some files from our previous work together on this in the Project Files, including the main.py file. Is what you just created compatible with this other work? If so, let's move forward with testing. If not, please revise accordingly. Once we complete testing, you can develop a final structured message following any new protocols developed. Or let me know how best to test and integrate with our current system. I'm not technical, so you decide. What's next?"
