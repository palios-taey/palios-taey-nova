    " I've reviewed your requirements.txt file. Here's what needs to be added to your Docker setup to ensure all dependencies are properly installed:\n\n1. Update the Dockerfile to use your actual requirements.txt:\n```bash\n# In your Dockerfile, ensure you're copying your requirements.txt file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n2. Make sure you add the tensorflow-rocm and protobuf pinning as we discussed earlier:\n```bash\n# Add to the end of your requirements.txt file\ntensorflow-rocm==2.14.0.600\nprotobuf==4.25.3\n```\n\n3. For the run script, ensure your paths are correct:\n```bash\n# Update the path in run-claude-dc.sh to match your actual path\n-v /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova:/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\n```\n\nThese changes should address the missing module error. The key is making sure we're using your exact requirements.txt file that includes all the dependencies Claude DC needs, including plotly for the dashboard."
