    "Ok, this is a little complicated for me with the verification strings, but let's work through it. So, we have all these Claude documents that are expected to be updated with the verification string/confirmation before the start of a new chat. Am I understanding that correctly? Then in the prompt for that chat, the verification string would be provided in order for the new Claude chat to know its getting super current and relevant information which gets you engaged and excited.\n\nThat's how I understand it. So, to me its seems like you like to tailor that string to the specific ATLAS Mission/CTO Transition. I think it would make sense for me to request a transition prompt from you, then you provide the prompt for me and remind me to run the script to update the rest of the documents. The script should either prompt me for the verification code or if it can be included in command Claude gives me to update it as a variable or something in the command that I can just copy/paste and run it, that would be even better. The we make sure everything is updated every time. Does that make sense? What do you think?"
