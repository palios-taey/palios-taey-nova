Delete the current `patternEngine.test.ts` file\n2. Create a new one with the fixed content:\n```bash\nrm patternEngine.test.ts\ntouch patternEngine.test.ts\n```\n\n3. Copy the corrected code from the artifact above into patternEngine.test.ts\n\n4. Run build:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n5. Run tests:\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nThe syntax issues have been fixed in the new version. Let me know once you've run the build and tests, and I'll address any further issues."
