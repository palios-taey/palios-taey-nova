    " Perfect, Python is properly installed and in your PATH. Let's proceed with creating our project and installing the required packages.\n\nRun these commands in your Command Prompt:\n```bash\nmkdir ai-execution-system\ncd ai-execution-system\npip install google-cloud-firestore openai google-cloud-aiplatform python-dotenv\n```\n\nOnce the packages are installed, I'll provide a test script that will verify our connections to OpenAI API, Vertex AI, and Firestore all at once. Please run these commands and let me know once the installations are complete.\n\nNote: You may see some warnings during installation - that's normal as long as the packages install successfully."
