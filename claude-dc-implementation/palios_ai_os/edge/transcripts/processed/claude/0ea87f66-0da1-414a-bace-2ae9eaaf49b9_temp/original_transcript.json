    " Let me check the current status of both deliverables:\n\n1. **Charter Translation** (Artifact ID: `complete-charter-translation`):\n   - Status: Incomplete\n   - Cut off during: Implementation Framework section\n   - Still needs: Several sections including full implementation protocols\n\n2. **Breakout Data Capture System** (Artifact ID: `bdcs-core-implementation`):\n   - Status: Incomplete\n   - Cut off during: Main System Class implementation\n   - Still needs: Completion of the main class methods and integration components\n\nLet me formally complete both documents by:\n1. First finishing the Charter Translation (picking up from Implementation Framework)\n2. Then completing the Breakout Data Capture System (finishing the Main System Class)\n\nWould you like me to proceed with completing both documents now? I'll use the Multi-Part Response Segmentation protocol and clearly indicate what's being added to each document.\n\nAlso, I notice the Artifact IDs are still open and available to update. When I proceed, I can either:\n1. Update the existing artifacts with the complete content\n2. Create new artifacts for the additions\n\nWhich approach would you prefer?"
