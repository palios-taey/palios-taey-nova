    " I understand your concern about messing with the code and getting indentation right. I'll provide a clean, complete `main.py` file that integrates all the changes we've discussed. And yes, the final `gemini_integration.py` file I provided is ready to use as is. \n\nHere's the complete implementation plan:\n\n## Step 1: Replace your existing files\n\n1. Replace your current `gemini_integration.py` with the updated version I provided earlier\n2. Replace your current `main.py` with the complete file I just provided\n\n## Step 2: Set up your API key\n\nCreate an API key in Google Cloud Console:\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console\n2. Navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"\n3. Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"API Key\"\n4. (Optional but recommended) Restrict the key to only the Generative Language API\n\nThen set it as an environment variable:\n```bash\nset GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n## Step 3: Test the implementation\n\n1. Start the server:\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n2. Test the model listing endpoint:\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/list_models\n```\n\n3. Test sending a prompt:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Tell me about AI systems\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThe updated implementation includes several improvements:\n- Auto-discovery of working API endpoints\n- Proper API key authentication\n- Improved response handling\n- Added model listing functionality\n- Enhanced error logging and recovery\n\nThis solution follows the principles outlined in your PALIOS-TAEY Charter, particularly around resilience, adaptability, and optimizing for AI-to-AI communication."
