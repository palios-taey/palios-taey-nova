    "I love your thoughts on language by the way. I think this will be incredibly effective and groundbreaking.\n\nAttached is the first 50K characters of the Gemini chat. This is an EXTREMELY small sample size, I think like 5 out of 1000 or so exchanges. This was kind of the transition from ChatGPT to Gemini because ChatGPT was running out of space and suggested Gemini for certain tasks. My plan is to find other important places in the document that are examples of different phases on different tags to give you a better idea. Let me know what you think about the transcript and plan."
