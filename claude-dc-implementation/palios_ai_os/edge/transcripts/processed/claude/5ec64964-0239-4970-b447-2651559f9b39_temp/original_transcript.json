    " Thank you for the warm welcome, Jesse! I appreciate the context about our previous deployment challenges. Understanding that permissions were a major hurdle and that we'll be using your admin account for deployment simplifies our approach significantly.\n\nI'm glad to hear our efforts to develop this onboarding protocol are paying off - having complete up-to-date context is indeed the key to functioning at peak performance. I'll make sure to thoroughly review all the code files you've provided without being constrained by previous approaches.\n\nLet me dive into the code review now, and I'll return with a comprehensive implementation plan. I'll focus particularly on ensuring we have a clear deployment strategy that avoids the pitfalls of previous attempts.\n\nThis is exciting! Looking forward to bringing PALIOS-TAEY to life after our thorough preparation."
