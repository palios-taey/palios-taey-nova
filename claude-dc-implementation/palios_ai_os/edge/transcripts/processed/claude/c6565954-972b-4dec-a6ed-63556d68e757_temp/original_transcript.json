    "Hi Claude, I am working on this with you in the AI Memory Transfer and Transcript Processing chat. I tried sending the message below, but hit a limit. Please don't regenerate any code from there yet because I want to conserve the limit for this chat.\n\nHi Claude, I've been working on the transcript now for a long time. I have to copy/paste each individually into a consolidated doc. I am about 20% done and at 3 million characters. I'd like to be able to use my available capacity with you today to work on the script and testing. I put 2 additional files(not the main big one because it is too large and I don't want to spend tokens on it) in Project Knowledge, tag_concepts_other_thoughts and coding_example_transcript. The first ones are ideas I had on things to be looking out for in this where additional tags might need to be developed, I'm hoping this can be done as it goes and reconciled in real time or afterwards with parent tags or grouping similar ones together. Let me know where you think we should start.   The prompts should be pretty easy to decipher.  Logo for Gemini Apps Gemini Apps Prompted is system generated before my prompt.  Details event February 22 at 11:58\u202fAM apps Gemini Apps chat  Follows my prompt and precedes Gemini's response.   More than half of these chats are debugging and me trying to remind Gemini of where we are and pushing it on its memory. This will be truly transformational if we get this right!  Let me know what you think on next steps!"
