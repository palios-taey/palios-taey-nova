    "Ok, so here's what's going on, we're working on this project together with Claude DC, details not important right now. I have this large cache of all the knowledge he needs to access and some build/implementation instructions for the project that we were going to submit separately. These build instructions outline the current plan for the project, but as we go, things might change. One side of me wants this in the cache so Claude DC knows what it's working toward, but I'm also concerned about that then making it too rigid and not allowing us to change course without changing the cache every time we do. I'm not sure if these concerns are valid or not, or what the best way to handle this is. What do you think?"
