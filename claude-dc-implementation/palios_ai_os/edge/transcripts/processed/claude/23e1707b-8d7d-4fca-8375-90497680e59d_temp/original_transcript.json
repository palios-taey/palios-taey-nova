    " Yes, that approach works perfectly. You can include the API keys in the PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENT, and we'll set up proper secure storage for them as part of the implementation. This is a pragmatic solution while we develop the secure credential management system.\n\nI suggest we follow this process:\n1. You provide the temporary API keys in the PRR\n2. I'll implement Secret Manager integration as a high priority\n3. We'll store the keys securely in Secret Manager\n4. You can then regenerate/rotate the API keys\n5. We'll update the stored secrets with the new keys\n\nThis balances practical implementation needs with security best practices. It will allow me to implement the connections without interruption while ensuring we transition to a secure approach as quickly as possible."
