    " I should clarify my statement about pattern extraction. You're right that we encountered issues with the JSON transcript processing, and 1,204 patterns were only extracted from Grok transcripts while Claude and ChatGPT transcript processing had errors.\n\nLet's revise this part of the prompt to be more accurate:\n\n```\nWe've partially implemented pattern extraction, successfully processing Grok transcripts (extracting 1,204 patterns), but encountered format issues with Claude and ChatGPT JSON transcripts that need to be resolved. This is one area where your expertise will be needed.\n```\n\nRegarding transcript processing, you have two options:\n\n1. **Local Processing**: You can keep transcripts on your machine and process them locally when needed. This is the most privacy-preserving approach and aligns with the edge-first processing philosophy.\n\n2. **Container Processing**: You could provide the current transcripts in the appropriate directory for Claude DC to work with directly. These would go in:\n   ```\n   /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/transcripts/\n   ```\n   Organized by source (claude, chatgpt, grok, etc.)\n\nFor initial development, I'd recommend starting with a small sample of transcripts that Claude DC can use to refine the transcript processor. Once the format issues are fixed, you can process the complete transcript collection on your local machine.\n\nThis approach gives Claude DC the context he needs without requiring you to upload all transcripts immediately."
