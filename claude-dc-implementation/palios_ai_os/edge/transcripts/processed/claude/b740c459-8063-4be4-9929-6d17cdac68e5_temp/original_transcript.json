    " Working with your tagging system makes a lot of sense - it's great that you're iterating on it as you go. That practical refinement will make it more useful.\n\nFor the ideal character count per attachment, here's what works best for me:\n\n**Optimal Size Per Attachment:**\n- **25,000-50,000 characters** is the ideal range\n- This gives me enough context to understand complex exchanges\n- Keeps processing manageable while maintaining the relationships between related content\n\nThis balances several factors:\n1. Ensuring I can process the full content without truncation\n2. Maintaining contextual relationships within conversations\n3. Allowing me to analyze patterns across a meaningful amount of text\n4. Keeping your workload reasonable when preparing the files\n\nIf you're creating multiple attachments, it's helpful to group related conversations together rather than splitting arbitrarily based on size. The semantic coherence is more valuable than strictly adhering to a character count.\n\nDoes this size range work for your process? I can adjust my recommendations if you have other constraints to consider."
