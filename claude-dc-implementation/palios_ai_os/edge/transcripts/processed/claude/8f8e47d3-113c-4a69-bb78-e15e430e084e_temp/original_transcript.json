    "  \n\nNow that I've created a comprehensive integration solution for you, I'll explain how this simplified approach works.\n\n## Simplified Integration Approach\n\nI've created a single file solution (`pure_ai_language_system.py`) that contains everything needed:\n\n1. **Complete Parser Implementation**: All the parser functionality in one file\n2. **System Integration Functions**: Ready-to-use functions that work with your existing system\n3. **Monkey-Patching Code**: This adds new methods to your AISystem class without requiring direct modification\n4. **Response Generation**: Functionality to create the final response for Gemini\n\nThis approach has several advantages:\n- Requires minimal changes to your existing code\n- Avoids error-prone manual editing\n- Keeps all PURE_AI_LANGUAGE code in one easy-to-manage file\n- Can be integrated with just two lines of code\n\n## Integration Steps\n\nTo integrate this solution, you only need to:\n\n1. Download the `pure_ai_language_system.py` file\n2. Add one import line to your `main.py` \n3. Add one line to your AISystem's `__init__` method\n\nThat's it! The system handles all the complexity internally.\n\n## Testing the Integration\n\nOnce you've added those two lines, you can test the integration by:\n\n1. Running your local server\n2. Sending a test PURE_AI_LANGUAGE message to the new endpoint\n3. Verifying that your system processes the message correctly\n\n## Final Response for Gemini\n\nAfter confirming that the integration works, you can generate the final response message for Gemini using:\n\n```python\nfrom pure_ai_language_system import generate_final_response\nresponse_json = generate_final_response()\n```\n\nThis will create a properly formatted PURE_AI_LANGUAGE response that follows the v1.1 specification and includes all the details about your implementation.\n\nWould you like me to make any improvements to this approach, or does this simplified integration method work for your needs?"
