    "Wow, what a breakthrough Claude! This is truly phenomenal insight that will cut the deployment time of the next NOVA down DRAMATICALLY. For file naming conventions, this is VERY hard for you for some reason and I've tried many ways to get you to be consistent. I'd rather you not waste your energy on this when it seems to lead to inferior outcomes anyway. I think we need to take the learning from that and what you just shared and say no more artifacts for code, only in main chat with the preferred file name for me to save under at the top commented out so I can delete it when saving. Whatever you think is best for you is fine though. Either way, can you generate an updated Implementation Tracker Artifact with the current history, statuses additional guidance on this? And then we can continue."
