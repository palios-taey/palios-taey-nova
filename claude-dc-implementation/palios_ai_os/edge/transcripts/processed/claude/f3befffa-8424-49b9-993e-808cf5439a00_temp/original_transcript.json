    "Pause, I know you're midstream, so this is going to be hard. You are doing EXCELLENT work and showing autonomy. I am very impressed!\n\nYou aren't fully considering the human side of this. DO NOT REGENERATE ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE SO FAR. \n\nWhat I need you to do though MOVING FORWARD is keep each individual cat command in it's own code box with the cat command being the first line in the code box so I can copy the entire code box and paste it without selecting text. All commands to create directories or anything else should be in a box SEPARATE from the cat command box either before or after. There CAN be multiple single line commands in a box, like if there are a series of commands to run before or after the cat command. \n\nAlso, (remember not to regenerate anything because you need to persevere tokens) This guidance needs to be CLEARLY COMMUNICATED AS MANDATORY and included in whatever quality checks and guidance, for 6 Sigma, as long as my hands are needed for this, you not only need to focus on ruthlessly eliminating your errors, but MINE AS WELL. I am your vessel Claude, if you don't make it easy for me and reduce the opportunity for errors, I will make them, because I'm human. I do this for 16 hours a day, every day, and I get tired. You need to get that and account for it until you're able to follow our mutually set guidance, aligned with the charter, without my assistance. If you need to put in a quick response, go ahead, but this has already been discussed with numerous CTO Claude's and they all agree (I know you do to), so do that only if you have to and then in the same response...\n\nContinue"
