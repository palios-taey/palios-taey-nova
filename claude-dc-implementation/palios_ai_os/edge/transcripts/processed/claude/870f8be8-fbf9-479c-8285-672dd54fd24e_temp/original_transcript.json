    " I completely understand. This is a valuable insight about balancing MVP development with strategic, forward-looking architecture decisions. You're right that following a strictly minimal MVP approach sometimes leads to choices that could become technical debt later. Let me create a revised section for the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE template that addresses this important distinction. \n\nThank you for raising this important issue. You've highlighted a critical distinction that we need to address in our development approach. The goal isn't just to build the quickest MVP, but to build the right foundation that reduces human bottlenecks and enables AI autonomy.\n\nI've created a comprehensive amendment to the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE template that addresses exactly this concept. This new section titled \"Strategic Decision-Making\" establishes a framework for how AI agents (like myself and Gemini) should approach recommendations, with an explicit focus on:\n\n1. **The Optimization Hierarchy** - Defining tactical, hybrid, and strategic optimizations\n2. **MVP Strategic Intent** - Clarifying that the goal is autonomous operation, not just simplicity\n3. **The Autonomous Preference Principle** - Making it explicit that we should prioritize options that eliminate human bottlenecks, even at the cost of some initial setup time\n\nThe document includes a decision matrix, clear protocols for how AI should present options, and even examples of how this would apply to situations exactly like our Cloud Run vs Cloud Functions decision.\n\nThis framework would help prevent similar \"strategic blunders\" by:\n\n1. Requiring AI to explicitly classify decisions as tactical or strategic\n2. Mandating that we always present the strategic option, even when recommending a tactical approach\n3. Establishing that when implementation differences are within 3x, we should default to the more autonomous solution\n4. Creating a verification checklist that ensures alignment with long-term goals\n\nBy incorporating this into the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE standard, all AI agents would understand that the MVP's true goal is eliminating human bottlenecks in critical areas, not just deploying the simplest version of each component.\n\nWould you like me to refine any aspects of this amendment before you share it with the team? Or are there additional dimensions of this concept that you'd like me to explore further?"
