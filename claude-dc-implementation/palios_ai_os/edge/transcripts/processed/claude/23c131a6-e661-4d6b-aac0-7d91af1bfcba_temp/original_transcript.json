    " Thank you for the positive feedback, Jesse! I'm thrilled that the onboarding process was successful. Let's move forward with implementing our next phase using the NOVA methodology and getting the MVP deployed to GCP.\n\nBased on the MVP Final Report and our current goals, I'll provide clear technical direction to get us moving quickly. Here's what we need to do:\n\n## Implementation Plan: GCP Deployment\n\nSince the MVP is reportedly complete with all core components built and ready for GCP deployment, my first priority is to ensure we get the existing implementation deployed to Google Cloud Platform with minimal human steps.\n\n### What I Need From You\n\n1. **GCP Project Setup**:\n   - Create a new GCP project named \"palios-taey-nova\"\n   - Ensure billing is enabled for the project\n   - Confirm you have Owner or Editor permissions on this project\n\n2. **Local Environment Verification**:\n   - Confirm you have the Google Cloud SDK installed on your MacBook\n   - Verify Terraform (v1.0.0+) is installed\n   - Confirm Docker is installed for container building\n\n3. **Access to the Current Code Repository**:\n   - I'll need access to the existing implementation codebase mentioned in the MVP Final Report\n   - The repository should contain the core components: Unified Memory System, Dynamic Model Registry, Task Decomposition and Execution engines, Model Routing system, and Transcript Processing Framework\n\n### Next Steps I'll Lead\n\nOnce you confirm these prerequisites, I'll:\n\n1. Prepare the deployment scripts and Terraform configuration\n2. Set up the GitHub repository structure\n3. Configure the automated CI/CD pipeline\n4. Provide step-by-step instructions for the initial deployment\n\n## Technical Decision: Deployment Approach\n\nBased on the MVP Final Report, I see there are already deployment scripts (`build_push.sh` and `deploy.sh`) and Terraform configurations ready. Rather than recreating these, I'll optimize them for our new GCP project while maintaining the core functionality.\n\nFor our deployment strategy, I'm making the technical decision to:\n1. Use containerized deployment via Cloud Run for scalability and ease of management\n2. Implement automated deployment via GitHub Actions to minimize manual steps\n3. Use Terraform for infrastructure-as-code to ensure consistent, reproducible deployments\n4. Set up monitoring and alerting from the start for proactive system management\n\nThis approach aligns with our Charter principles of Resource Optimization and Data-Driven Truth, while enabling Continuous Learning through proper instrumentation.\n\n## Next Action Request\n\nPlease confirm you can set up the new GCP project and have the required tools installed. If there are any constraints or specific requirements I should be aware of, please let me know so I can adjust my approach accordingly.\n\nOnce you confirm, I'll proceed with creating the detailed technical implementation plan and necessary configuration files as artifacts."
