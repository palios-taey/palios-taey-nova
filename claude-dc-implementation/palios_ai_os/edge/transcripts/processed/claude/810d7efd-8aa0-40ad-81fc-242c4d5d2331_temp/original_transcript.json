    " Let's dive into testing the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server functionality next. This is the component that enables AI-to-AI communication through mathematical patterns.\n\n### Test 1: Check if MCP Server is Running\n\n1. First, let's check if the MCP server is running on port 8001:\n   - Open a new terminal window\n   - Run this command to check if the port is active:\n     ```\n     curl http://localhost:8001/status\n     ```\n\nLet me know what response you get. If you get an error or no response, we'll need to try a different approach to check the server status."
