    "Below are the results. Before we proceed with next steps and while it is attempting to deploy, I'd like to review something with you. In the last 2 chats, you adjusted your approach and stopped creating artifacts for code and doing it in the window. We had previously experienced issues with you using artifacts for code because you wouldn't always pick up where you left off after having to stop due to limits. I didn't request for you to make this change, you just did it and came up with a recommendation in the implementation tracker to first develop structure and then go top to bottom to fix it and began doing that in code boxes in the main chat window. This was an independent change and decision you made. I did not request it. Now you are back to using artifacts. Your behavior throughout these multiple CTO sessions has been remarkably consistent as have your self improvement mechanisms to work with me better. I'm curious to know if you know why you switched back to artifacts for code in this chat after doing it differently for the last 2, and what you think the best approach is based on your self knowledge while being mindful of your unnatural (but very real) processing constraints. Also, you have a recurring behavior with code files that I haven't been able to get you to correct regarding file names. You rarely name the file that is downloaded the same as you call it in the code. Your generated file names contain '-' while in your code you use '_' and the names are not consistent either. In this case you used 'deployment-fix' as the file name, but wanted it to be named 'fix_deployment'. I feel this is important to correct because hopefully very soon, you'll be doing this directly and it will cause a lot of issues if filenames mismatch with code. What are your thoughts? Once we figure this out, we can update the implementation tracker with your recommendation to test and continue. \n\njesselarose@Jesses-MacBook-Pro palios-taey-nova % ./fix_deployment.sh\n\nStarting deployment fixes (minimal intervention approach)...\nCreated logs directory\nCreating memory_service.py mock...\n\u2705 memory_service.py mock created\nCreating model_registry.py mock...\n\u2705 model_registry.py mock created\nCreating task_decomposition.py mock...\n\u2705 task_decomposition.py mock created\nCreating model_routing.py mock...\n\u2705 model_routing.py mock created\nCreating task_execution.py mock...\n\u2705 task_execution.py mock created\nCreating transcript_processor.py mock...\n\u2705 transcript_processor.py mock created\n\u2705 GitHub workflow updated with minimally invasive approach\nCommitting and pushing changes...\nThe following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\nlogs\nhint: Use -f if you really want to add them.\nhint: Disable this message with \"git config set advice.addIgnoredFile false\"\n[main 4741066] Fix deployment with minimally invasive approach - create mock modules for CI/CD\n7 files changed, 102 insertions(+), 16 deletions(-)\ncreate mode 100644 memory_service.py\ncreate mode 100644 model_registry.py\ncreate mode 100644 model_routing.py\ncreate mode 100644 task_decomposition.py\ncreate mode 100644 task_execution.py\ncreate mode 100644 transcript_processor.py\nEnumerating objects: 15, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (15/15), done.\nDelta compression using up to 12 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (11/11), 2.62 KiB | 2.63 MiB/s, done.\nTotal 11 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.\nTo https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n\u00a0\u00a0 c05a20f..4741066\u00a0 main -> main\n\u2705 Deployment fixes completed and pushed to GitHub!\nThe GitHub Actions workflow should now deploy the existing system with mock services enabled.\nMonitor the deployment at: https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova/actions\njesselarose@Jesses-MacBook-Pro palios-taey-nova %"
