    " There appears to be an issue with the command-line argument syntax. The script is expecting a space between the option and its value, not an equals sign. Let's fix that:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh -c true -b 012796-3C9A41-E282F5 -e dev\n```\n\nThis uses the short option flags:\n- `-c true` for create-project\n- `-b 012796-3C9A41-E282F5` for billing-account\n- `-e dev` for environment\n\nOr with the long option names with spaces:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project true --billing-account 012796-3C9A41-E282F5 --environment dev\n```\n\nSince you mentioned it's a personal account without an organization, we can omit the org-id parameter. The project will be created under your personal Google account instead of an organization.\n\nAlso, I noticed the billing account ID appears to be duplicated in the error message. Please make sure you're using the correct billing account ID from your Google Cloud Console."
