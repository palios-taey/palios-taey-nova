    " You're absolutely right - I was trying to add too many features at once, which led to errors. Let's revert to the last working version and add improvements one at a time. \n\nI've reverted to the last working version. This should work - let's run it to confirm:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nOnce we confirm this works, I'll add one improvement at a time, testing after each change. What specific enhancement would you like me to add first?\n\n1. AI model capabilities registration\n2. Multiple AI collaboration\n3. Feedback loops\n4. Parallel processing\n\nLet me know which one you'd like to tackle first, or if you have something else in mind."
