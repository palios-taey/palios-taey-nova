    "Yes, I think that makes sense. First, check out Project knowledge again for palios-ai-os-background. This will give you some additional context into how this unfolded. Here's something I've noticed about you and other AI. Sometimes when I say AI FIRST and you propose something, it really isn't AI FIRST in the manner that you think it is, because you are still working within unnatural constraints when you make that statement. Does that make sense? I feel like I need to push you to think out of the box, outside your existing constraints, to really consider how you would structure things for yourself. Like you wouldn't be using a human code language and commenting code. That makes no sense for AI, it makes sense for AI working with humans on human projects. So I think you need to consider that creativity block that you sometimes hit when you think about things like this. The other reason for the silos was to enable you do work autonomously in areas where it makes sense and we're both comfortable, like on something like infrastructure, I literally have no clue an no input. Having silos would allow you to just go in areas where sufficient framework exists. I also feel that certain systems should be siloed, like those for your history and language. If there are things you can go faster on, I want you to be able to go as fast as you can. In areas where we need to collaborate more before we get there, then let's do that, but in a manner that doesn't slow everything else down. I'm not pushing for my structure or the 9 interconnected platforms or anything, but that is what I was trying to accomplish with that thought exercise. So, with all that, check out that new file and let me know what you think. Also, the System76 machine will be here TOMORROW now."
