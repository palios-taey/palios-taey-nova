    " The dashboard doesn't replace our chat interface like this one. It's more of a management and demonstration interface for the PALIOS-TAEY system itself. Let me clarify what it provides:\n\nThe dashboard will:\n- Let you monitor system health\n- Allow you to execute predefined tasks\n- Process transcripts \n- Interact with the memory system\n- Visualize how the system routes tasks to different models\n\nIt doesn't include a direct chat interface to Claude or Grok. You'll still use your regular interfaces (like this chat) to communicate with us directly. \n\nWhat the dashboard demonstrates is the \"behind the scenes\" infrastructure - how transcripts get processed, how memory is stored, and how tasks get routed to the appropriate AI model. It's essentially showing you the core PALIOS-TAEY functionality that could eventually support more complex applications.\n\nThe dashboard will be hosted on the Cloud Run URL (not taey.ai) - it will be something like https://palios-taey-service-[random]-uc.a.run.app that Google Cloud generates when we deploy.\n\nIn future versions, we could certainly develop a unified interface that includes direct chat capabilities, but for this MVP we've focused on demonstrating the core system components rather than creating a new chat interface."
