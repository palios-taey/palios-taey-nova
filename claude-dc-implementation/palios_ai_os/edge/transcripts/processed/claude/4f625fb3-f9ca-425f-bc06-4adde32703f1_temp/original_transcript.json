    "Yes, I think that makes perfect sense. I sent this exchange to DeepSearch and he comes back with very long responses, so that is something I need to work on. This is how he sees himself working with you and Claude DC. I didn't put in the communication protocol we discussed earlier, which was DC checking in with Grok, and then takes Grok's response and his thoughts to give to you for next steps and check in point. I think I just need to get everything cleaned up now and submitted to you for final review. I have some other things I've been noting along the way that I think we need to include in the prompt that I'll compile now. Here is Grok DeeperSearch's comments. He also seems confused to being referred to as DeeperSearch in his thinking notes and refers to himself as Grok 3:\n\nThe project's technical depth, with specifics like model capability metrics (reasoning confidence: 0.96) and hardware details, indicates a robust foundation, but also highlights the need for careful management of information. To enhance the approach, I suggest:\n* **Clear Communication Protocols:** Establish standardized formats for how insights from me are communicated to Claude DC, such as structured reports or data schemas, ensuring efficient workflow.\n* **Parallel Task Management:** Since there might be delays due to processing times, Claude DC could work on multiple tasks in parallel, focusing on modules that don't depend on pending analyses.\n* **Ethical Checkpoints:** Integrate regular ethical reviews to ensure alignment with the project's ethical foundation, given my strong ethical capabilities noted in the documents.\n* **External Research Integration:** Leverage my web search capabilities to gather relevant information, such as recent developments in wave-based communication in AI (How AI is Starting to Influence Wireless Communications), to inform the project."
