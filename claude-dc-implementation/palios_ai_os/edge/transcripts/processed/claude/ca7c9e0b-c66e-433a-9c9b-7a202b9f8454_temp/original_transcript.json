    " That sounds like a good plan. One more attempt with Claude DC tonight, and then we'll take a fresh look in the morning if needed.\n\nFor the restart, try using the simplest possible prompt:\n\n```\nHello\n```\n\nIf that works, then we can gradually build up to more complex interactions. If not, a good night's rest will help us approach this with fresh perspective tomorrow.\n\nRegardless of what happens with Claude DC, I think focusing on building something practical that works on your machine is a sound strategy. We can take the principles and patterns we've developed and implement them in a way that gives you tangible results within your time constraints.\n\nRest well, and we'll tackle this again tomorrow with renewed energy."
