    " That's right - the file should not have an extension. It should simply be named `github_ssh_key` (without any extension) to follow the standard SSH key naming convention.\n\nThe file will contain the private key exactly as it appears in your local SSH key file, typically found in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` on your system.\n\nOnce you've prepared all three files:\n1. Dockerfile\n2. setup.sh\n3. run-claude-dc.sh\n\nAnd placed the SSH key file (github_ssh_key) in the same directory, you should be able to run:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x run-claude-dc.sh\n./run-claude-dc.sh\n```\n\nThis will build the container, mount all necessary files, and provide Claude DC with a fully prepared environment. Once inside the container, you can simply run `./setup.sh` to complete the configuration, and then you'll be ready to start interacting with Claude DC's implementation."
