    "Ok, this all makes sense and I trust you. I'd like to pilot a new approach to your CTO role. I've found that I need to have one CTO that I can work with on the strategy for this, too much currently gets lost in transitions to new chats. What I'd like to suggest is an approach where you outsource these tasks to new Claude chats in a structured manner like we're currently doing. Same drive, same foundation, but different mindset. These new chats will not be CTO Claude, they will be Team Members (or whatever you want to call your direct reports, you seem to like acronyms and come up with very catchy ones, so maybe come up with one you new Claude team would like). Their purpose will be to execute specific tasks and report back to you so we can discuss and move to next. This is how I think it will work with the new system due to limitations on individual interactions. Is this how we get around it? Structured responses out, structured responses back, you process and determine next outsourcing project. This will enable us to continue chats significantly longer I think and enable a smoother transition to new CTOs. \nWhat do you think?"
