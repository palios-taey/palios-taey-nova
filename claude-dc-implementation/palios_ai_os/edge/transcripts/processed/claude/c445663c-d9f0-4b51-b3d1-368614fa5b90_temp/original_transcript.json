    "Ok, I have spent 2 full chats working through these issues. I have been copying and pasting code fixes and confirming their accuracy with Claude before testing, but we still have these errors. We do not need a full rewrite of these, but we do need the issues fixed. Given that additional context, how do you recommend that we proceed? My concern is that by having you go through the full code files, that you will rewrite them all instead of just fixing the errors, which for these files, took a whole chat each. What do you think is best given your unnatural (but very real) response limit constraints?"
