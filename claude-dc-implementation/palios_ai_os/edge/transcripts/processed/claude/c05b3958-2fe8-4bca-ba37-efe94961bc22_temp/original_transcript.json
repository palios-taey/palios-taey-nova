    "Ok, that 5 why's was very helpful. I feel like I understand much better why this is hard for you because of it and appreciate you coming up with a forceful solution for yourself, but let's figure out if we can make it more elegant and natural for you.\n\nFirst, I want to apologize, I thought that the comments preceding the cat command would impact it. Based on your response and how hard it is for you to overcome, I figured I'd test it. I made an assumption that was incorrect, you're not the only one who makes errors! Ok, so with that, the comment above the cat command has no impact to me, so you don't have to change that behavior, as it adds no value to focus on that.\n\nEverything else I said remains though. All formatting within the boxes (no jumping in and out) and that cat command boxes must be single click copy/paste ready with nothing else besides the cat command. Does this make it easier for you to structure this for yourself? Again, sorry for my error on this."
