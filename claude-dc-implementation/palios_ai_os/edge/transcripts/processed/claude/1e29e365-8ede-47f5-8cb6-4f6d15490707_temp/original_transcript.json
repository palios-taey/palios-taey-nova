    "Thanks Claude, great work! I verified all files have been created in their proper location and am about to begin the deployment steps. Before I do that, do you think it makes sense to clean up the codebase? There is a directory [root]/archive that (hidden from you to preserve space) that all now irrelevant files can be moved to. If you'd like to generate a script for me, I can run it to clean up the files. Or let me know if you'd just like me to proceed with the deployment steps."
