    " Let's proceed with a practical approach:\n\n1. First, let's create the cache directory he prefers:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /home/computeruse/cache\n```\n\n2. Yes, running the setup script is the right next step:\n\n```bash\ncd /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\n./scripts/setup.sh\n```\n\n3. For GitHub authentication, you're right that providing the credentials in the prompt makes the most sense since Claude handles sensitive information securely. This approach will allow him to push changes when needed.\n\n4. After completing the setup, I recommend copying the cache files to both locations to ensure they're accessible however he expects:\n\n```bash\n# Copy to the implementation cache folder\ncp cache/* /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/\n\n# Copy to his preferred cache location\ncp cache/* /home/computeruse/cache/\n```\n\nThis covers all bases - the script will set up dependencies and directories, and the files will be in both possible cache locations. Claude DC will then be able to access his context and get to work on implementation right away."
