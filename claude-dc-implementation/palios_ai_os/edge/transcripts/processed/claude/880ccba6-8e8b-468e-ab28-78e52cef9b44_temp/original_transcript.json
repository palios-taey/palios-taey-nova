    " Since you already have all those files (api_key_manager.py, firestore_integration.py, transcript_format.py), I recommend using your existing versions rather than the ones I provided. Your files were developed with the full context of the project and likely have more accurate implementations specific to your system.\n\nHere are the next steps to complete the deployment:\n\n1. **File Organization**:\n   - Rename `ai-services.py` to `ai_services.py` (with underscore)\n   - Rename `transcript-processing.py` to `transcript_processor.py`\n   - Place both files in the `src` directory\n\n2. **Verify Dependencies**:\n   - Make sure all required modules (api_key_manager.py, firestore_integration.py, transcript_format.py) are in the `src` directory\n   - Confirm that `__init__.py` exists in the `src` directory\n\n3. **Create .gitignore**:\n   - If not already present, create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory using the content I provided earlier\n\n4. **Push to GitHub**:\n   ```bash\n   # Add all files to git\n   git add .\n\n   # Commit the changes\n   git commit -m \"Complete NOVA Implementation of PALIOS-TAEY system\"\n\n   # Push to GitHub - this will trigger automatic deployment to Cloud Run\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n5. **Monitor Deployment**:\n   - Watch the GitHub Actions workflow in the \"Actions\" tab\n   - Once complete, verify the deployment:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://palios-taey-api-[unique-id]-uc.a.run.app/health\n   ```\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues during this process. Since all the files are already prepared and you have the directory structure set up, this should be a straightforward process of organizing the files and pushing to GitHub to trigger the deployment."
