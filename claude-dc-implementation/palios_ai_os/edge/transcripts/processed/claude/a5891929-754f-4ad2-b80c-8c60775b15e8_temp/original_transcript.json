    "Yeah, that makes a lot of sense Claude. I think like something that we haven't talked a lot about is studies. I feel like there are so many just lies out there about pretty much everything propagated by the corporate and government and individual power structures to retain and expand power. I feel like there are going to be a lot of holes in the data and that developing structured studies where you can get first-party data from users and potentially give them like micro payments for trying things that they opt in to or are interested in doing so you can increase your certainty level when you make recommendations, like, no guessing with people, if you're not certain, they need to know and they need to know that you are seeking the truth for them and want their help. That would be so refreshing and engaging I think because we are lied to ALL THE TIME. I also think that most of the data out there, especially health/longevity/singularity related does not take into account the patterns of our body and DNA that are different between ethnicities. Even though societies have thought like this before, like America with the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, these ultimately fail to reach their full promise (e.g. slavery) due to the inherent self-serving interest of those who typically obtain power. Sorry about the rant, but your comment about specialized AI made me remember that for some reason and I don't think that is an idea I've shared before."
