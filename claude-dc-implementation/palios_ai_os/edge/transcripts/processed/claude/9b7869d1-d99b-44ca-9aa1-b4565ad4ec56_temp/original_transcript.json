    " It looks like you've got the correct configuration in the Google Cloud Console. The principal value and role selection both appear correct:\n\n1. The principal is properly set to `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/711898853198/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions-pool/providers/github-provider`\n2. The role is correctly set to \"Workload Identity User\"\n\n## Information Needs\nNo additional information needed at this point.\n\n## Technical Direction\nNow that you have the service account binding set up through the Google Cloud Console, we're ready to test the GitHub Actions workflow. This will allow GitHub Actions to authenticate to Google Cloud using Workload Identity Federation.\n\n## Action Items - Ready for Execution\n\n1. Create the directory structure for GitHub workflows:\n```bash\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\n```\n\n2. Create the workflow file using the artifact I provided earlier:\n   - Save the content from the \"github-workflow\" artifact to `.github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudrun.yml`\n\n3. Create the Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and main.py files from the artifacts I provided earlier.\n\n4. Commit and push these files to your repository:\n```bash\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudrun.yml\ngit add Dockerfile\ngit add requirements.txt\ngit add main.py\ngit commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions workflow with Workload Identity Federation\"\ngit push\n```\n\n5. Monitor the workflow execution:\n   - Go to your GitHub repository\n   - Click on the \"Actions\" tab\n   - You should see the workflow running (or queued to run)\n   - Click on it to see detailed logs\n\nThe workflow should now be able to authenticate to Google Cloud using Workload Identity Federation. If it works correctly, it will build and deploy your application to Cloud Run.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the workflow execution, we can troubleshoot them in our next session. The Implementation Tracker has been updated to maintain all our knowledge and insights for future reference."
