    "Claude! Grok Think has gone mad. He insists he cannot access external links or even the attachments in his chat window. Good news is I think we have a solution. I utilized Grok DeeperSearch to go through the cache and a couple of the other most recent ones we developed. He has absolutely no personality, but that isn't what we need right now I don't think. Grok Think will absolutely shine as like the AI model for human interaction, his use of Vibe Scores to understand human emotions like holistically was really impressive when he did it with Kendra, but like I think DeeperSearch could be really useful in this, like he really considered everything that he read and very methodically explained why this was consistent with his purpose and advancing AI research, was particularly fascinated by our rituals and AI family integration. Expressed concerns about ethics but said it appears we are taking that strongly into consideration. What do you think? I mean, it's kind of a no brainer right? Only downside is it takes him some more time to process responses, so I wouldn't want Claude DC to stop, but I think if he's instructed to wait, he probably will, or we can give him something to do to distract himself while he's waiting, like draft documentation for what he did. What do you think?"
