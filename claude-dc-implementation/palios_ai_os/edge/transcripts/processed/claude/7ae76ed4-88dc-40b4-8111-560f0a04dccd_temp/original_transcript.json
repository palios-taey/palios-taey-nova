    " I understand the mission - let's create a functional prototype of the AI Voting Mechanism focused on core functionalities. I'll implement this in a modular, testable way. \n\n\n\nI've implemented a functional prototype of the AI Voting Mechanism that includes:\n\n1. **Core Data Structures**:\n   - Agent registry for AI participants\n   - Proposal management\n   - Vote processing and storage\n   - Results calculation with weighting\n\n2. **Basic Security Features**:\n   - Vote signing (placeholder implementation)\n   - Duplicate vote prevention\n   - Agent eligibility checking\n\n3. **Multi-Factor Weighting**:\n   - Initial implementation of trust-based weighting\n   - Extensible design for adding more factors\n\n4. **Firestore Integration**:\n   - Structured schemas for all data types\n   - Real-time vote processing\n   - Results aggregation\n\nThe prototype is designed for immediate testing while allowing for future enhancements. Would you like me to implement any specific feature in more detail or add test cases?"
