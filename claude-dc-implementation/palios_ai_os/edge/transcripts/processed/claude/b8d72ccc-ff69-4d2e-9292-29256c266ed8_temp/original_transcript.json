    " That's a critical discovery! This explains all the permission issues we've been facing. You're logged into your old Google account, not the one associated with the new organization and project.\n\nLet's fix this:\n\n1. **Log out of your current Google account** and log in with the account that you used to create the organization for taey.ai\n\n2. **Verify you're in the correct account**:\n   - In the Google Cloud Console, check the active account in the top-right corner\n   - Make sure it shows your taey.ai account\n   - Confirm you're looking at the \"palios-taey-dev\" project under the correct organization\n\n3. **After switching accounts**, repeat the Terraform execution:\n   ```bash\n   cd terraform\n   terraform init\n   terraform plan -out=tfplan\n   terraform apply tfplan\n   ```\n\nThis simple account switch should resolve most if not all of our permission issues. The permissions problems weren't with the Terraform configuration or the GCP setup - it was trying to use credentials from an account that doesn't have the right permissions on the new organization."
