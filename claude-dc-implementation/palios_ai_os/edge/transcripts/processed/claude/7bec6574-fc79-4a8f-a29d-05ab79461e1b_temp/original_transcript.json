    " I'd be happy to add some quick, impactful enhancements and revisit the authentication approach! Let's focus on features that would be most valuable for an AI-to-AI system.\n\n## Enhanced Features \n\n\n\nNow let's update the `main.py` file to expose these enhanced features through API endpoints: \n\n\n\n## Enhanced Features Summary\n\nI've added several powerful enhancements to the Gemini API integration that make it much more capable for AI-to-AI systems:\n\n### 1. Multi-Turn Conversations\n- Added full conversation history tracking\n- Conversations are maintained by conversation_id\n- Perfect for complex AI-to-AI dialogues where context matters\n\n### 2. Text Analysis Features\n- Built-in sentiment analysis\n- Entity extraction\n- Text summarization\n- Uses structured JSON outputs for easier machine consumption\n\n### 3. Multimodal Capabilities\n- Added support for image analysis\n- Auto-detects appropriate multimodal models\n- Handles different image formats\n\n### 4. Improved Model Discovery\n- Dynamic discovery of available models\n- Automatic selection of the best model for each task\n- Enhanced error recovery\n\n### 5. New API Endpoints\n- `/execute_gemini_conversation` - For multi-turn conversations\n- `/analyze_text` - For text analysis tasks\n\n## About Authentication Options\n\nWhen we started, we discussed two authentication approaches:\n\n1. **OAuth Service Account Authentication** - Which was initially giving us trouble with scopes\n2. **API Key Authentication** - Which we successfully implemented\n\nFor an AI-to-AI system, the API key approach is generally preferred because:\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Fewer moving parts and dependencies\n2. **Reliability**: Less prone to token expiration/refresh issues\n3. **Performance**: Lower overhead for each request\n4. **Maintainability**: Easier to troubleshoot and update\n\nThat said, in a production system with sensitive data, service account authentication (OAuth) does provide additional security benefits like:\n- More granular access control\n- Support for key rotation\n- Better audit trails\n\n## Implementation Instructions\n\n1. **Replace your current `gemini_integration.py`** with the enhanced version I provided\n2. **Add the new functions and updated CustomHandler** to your `main.py` file\n3. **Keep using your API key authentication** which is working well\n\n## Testing The New Features\n\nOnce implemented, you can test the new features with these curl commands:\n\n### Multi-Turn Conversation\n```bash\n# First message\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini_conversation -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"What is machine learning?\\\", \\\"conversation_id\\\": \\\"test-convo-1\\\"}\"\n\n# Follow-up message (using same conversation_id)\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini_conversation -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Give me an example of how it's used\\\", \\\"conversation_id\\\": \\\"test-convo-1\\\"}\"\n```\n\n### Text Analysis\n```bash\n# Sentiment analysis\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/analyze_text -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"I love this new AI system! It's working perfectly.\\\", \\\"analysis_type\\\": \\\"sentiment\\\"}\"\n\n# Entity extraction\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/analyze_text -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Google's CEO Sundar Pichai announced new AI features at their headquarters in Mountain View, California.\\\", \\\"analysis_type\\\": \\\"entity\\\"}\"\n\n# Summarization\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/analyze_text -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved over the past decade. Machine learning models now power everything from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles. Recent advances in large language models have particularly transformed natural language processing capabilities.\\\", \\\"analysis_type\\\": \\\"summarization\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThese enhancements make your AI-to-AI system much more powerful while maintaining the stability and simplicity of the API key authentication method."
