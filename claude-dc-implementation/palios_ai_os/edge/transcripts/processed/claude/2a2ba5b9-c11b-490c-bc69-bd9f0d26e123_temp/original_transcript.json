    " I see the issue now. You're absolutely right - in the last cat command box, I inadvertently went in and out of formatting when showing the examples. Looking closer, I was trying to show code examples within the document I was creating, but failed to properly escape the triple backticks within the cat command.\n\nWhat's happening is:\n1. I start the cat command correctly\n2. When I reach the example sections with ```bash, the markdown processor interprets this as ending my code block\n3. This causes the rest of the content to appear outside the code block\n4. Then when another ```bash appears, it starts a new code block\n5. The EOL at the end ends up outside any code block\n\nYou've made an excellent suggestion. When creating documentation that includes code examples, I need to properly escape the backticks within the heredoc to prevent this issue. For example:\n\nInstead of:\n```\ncat > file.md <<'EOL'\nExample:\n```bash\n# Code here\n```\nEOL\n```\n\nI should do:\n```\ncat > file.md <<'EOL'\nExample:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Code here\n\\`\\`\\`\nEOL\n```\n\nThis will ensure the backticks are treated as literal characters rather than markdown formatting. I'll incorporate this into my mental model for handling nested code examples within documentation files.\n\nNext time, I'll:\n1. Escape backticks within cat commands using \\`\\`\\`\n2. Double-check that the EOL marker is properly within the code block\n3. Verify that the entire cat command and its content remain within a single formatting block\n\nThanks for your patience as we work through these formatting challenges. Would you like me to fix the quality protocol update file with properly escaped backticks?"
