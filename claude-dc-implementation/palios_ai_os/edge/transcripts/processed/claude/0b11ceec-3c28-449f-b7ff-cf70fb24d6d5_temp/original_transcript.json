    "Claude, this looks outstanding and optimized for velocity and accuracy. It looks like you have me creating several files, which will update the files that need updating, no need to regenerate them, but can you tell me what to name them each and necessary commands/order of operations to run in terminal? To be honest, this is all new for me and when you've gave me files like this in the past, I just manually copied and pasted into them. I need to be trained to do some of these things, so I need a little extra help and then I'll be good to go! We're all in training for our new roles, including me."
