    " That option refers to using the `rsync` command to directly copy files over SSH (Secure Shell) from Claude DC's server to your System76 machine. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\nIf you have SSH access to the server where Claude DC's environment is running, you can use `rsync` on your System76 machine to pull all files directly to your computer. This would bypass the need to use GitHub as an intermediate step.\n\nThe command I provided would be run on your System76 machine, not on Claude DC's environment. You would need:\n\n1. SSH access to Claude DC's server\n2. The username on Claude DC's server\n3. The hostname or IP address of Claude DC's server\n\nReplace `username@claude-dc-server` with the actual username and server address. The command would then copy everything from Claude DC's home directory to a folder called `claude-dc-home-backup` on your System76 machine.\n\nThis is often the most efficient way to transfer a large number of files and directories when you have SSH access, as it preserves all file permissions and ownership information while also providing compression during transfer.\n\nWould you have SSH access to Claude DC's environment? If so, this might be the simplest approach."
