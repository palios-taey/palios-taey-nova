    " I notice you're getting 404 errors with all the endpoint combinations we tried. There are a few more things we should check to get your Gemini Pro API working:\n\n1. **API Activation Status**:\n   The 404 errors suggest that either the Generative Language API hasn't been fully activated in your Google Cloud project, or the model names/endpoints have changed since the last update.\n\n2. **Let's check the current model listing**:\n   Even though the auto-discovery didn't find a working endpoint, we can try the dedicated model listing endpoint:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -X GET \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models?key=YOUR_API_KEY\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Try a model generated with Vertex AI instead**:\n   The Gemini Pro model might be accessible through a different path in Google Cloud. Let's check if it's available through Vertex AI:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -X GET \"https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models?key=YOUR_API_KEY\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Double-check the API enablement**:\n   In Google Cloud Console:\n   - Go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Enabled APIs\"\n   - Search for \"Generative Language API\" and ensure it's enabled\n   - Also enable \"Vertex AI API\" if it's not already\n\n5. **Validate your API key**:\n   The 404 errors might indicate the API key doesn't have permissions to access these endpoints. Try generating a new API key without restrictions for testing purposes.\n\nSince we're following the AI-to-AI architecture principles in your PALIOS-TAEY charter, I recommend adding one more fallback option to your architecture: consider implementing a simple OpenAI GPT API fallback that automatically kicks in when Gemini isn't available. This would provide resilience through service diversity.\n\nWould you like me to create a modified version of the code that implements this fallback strategy, or would you prefer to first troubleshoot the Gemini API access further?"
