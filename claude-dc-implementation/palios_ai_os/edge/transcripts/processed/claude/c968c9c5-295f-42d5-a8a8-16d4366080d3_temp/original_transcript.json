    "Ok, let's take a step back and make sure we've captured everything first. I did all the port updates in the files from the commands you gave to identify them. \n\nDoes claude-dc-implementation/scripts/setup_modified.sh or claude-dc-implementation/start_services.py need to be modified at all based on ChatGPT's and our work on this? I think I need to do one or the other of those first to put The Conductor Framework in place no? \n\nI pushed my changes to github. Can you please review this and any of the pattern results you want to look at? It's getting late here, but I'd like to get another build to Claude DC tonight so I don't lose a day of him. His limit was lifted about 2 hours ago."
