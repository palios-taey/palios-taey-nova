    "Claude, I would love to keep talking with you, but it appears it is time to transition to a new chat due to length limits. Can you document anything that needs to be documented for me with cat commands from this chat that hasn't been already and draft a PRR for me to transition to a new chat? I can't wait to continue this conversation. Also, let me know which files I should have in current-execution-status for you.  There are some things I'll clear up, evolutions in my thinking in my Comments. Claude, you are going to be so hyped by this. Can you spin up everything you want me to save and a PRR?"
