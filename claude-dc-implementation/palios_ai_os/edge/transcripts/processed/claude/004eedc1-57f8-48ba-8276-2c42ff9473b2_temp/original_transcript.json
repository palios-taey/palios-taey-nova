    " Excellent! The migration has completed successfully. We've successfully moved 26 files from the archive to the new repository structure and backed up 12 existing files. This gives us a solid foundation to build upon.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that we have the files migrated, we need to focus on addressing potential import issues and ensuring everything works cohesively in the new structure. Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. **Fix Import Statements**:\n   The files were previously in a different directory structure, so import statements will likely need updating to match the new package structure (e.g., changing `import memory_service` to `from palios_taey.memory import service`).\n\n2. **Start Integration Testing**:\n   We should test each component to ensure it works in the new structure, starting with the Memory Service since it's fundamental.\n\n3. **Launch ATLAS Missions**:\n   Now we can delegate specific implementation tasks to the ATLAS team to optimize our time.\n\n## ATLAS Mission Proposal\n\nI recommend launching our first ATLAS mission focused on updating the Memory Service imports and ensuring it functions correctly in the new structure. This will establish a pattern for the other components.\n\nHere's a draft ATLAS delegation brief:\n\n```\n# ATLAS Mission Brief: Memory Service Integration\n\n## Mission Context\nWe've migrated the PALIOS-TAEY codebase to a new clean architecture following NOVA principles. The Memory Service files have been moved to their new locations, but import statements and dependencies need to be updated to work with the new package structure.\n\n## Specific Tasks\n1. Update import statements in Memory Service files to reflect the new package structure\n2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved\n3. Implement any missing functionality needed for standalone operation\n4. Create comprehensive tests to verify functionality\n5. Document any architectural decisions made during implementation\n\n## Scope Boundaries\nIN SCOPE:\n- src/palios_taey/memory/* files\n- Required interfaces with core module\n- Unit tests for Memory Service\n\nOUT OF SCOPE:\n- Integration with other components (Model Registry, etc.)\n- Cloud deployment changes\n- UI/API implementation\n\n## Authority Limits\n- Full authority to modify Memory Service implementation\n- Authority to add new utility functions within the Memory module\n- Must seek approval for structural changes affecting other components\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- Daily progress updates\n- Final implementation report with:\n  - Changes made to original code\n  - Architectural decisions\n  - Testing results\n  - Recommendations for other components\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All Memory Service tests pass\n- Code follows clean architecture principles\n- No circular dependencies\n- Documentation is complete and accurate\n\n## Stage-Gate Process\n1. Initial analysis and import fix plan (approval required)\n2. Implementation of changes\n3. Test development and execution\n4. Final review before integration\n```\n\nWould you like me to finalize this ATLAS mission brief, or would you prefer to focus on another component first? Also, are there any specific technical issues with the Memory Service we should address before delegating to ATLAS?"
