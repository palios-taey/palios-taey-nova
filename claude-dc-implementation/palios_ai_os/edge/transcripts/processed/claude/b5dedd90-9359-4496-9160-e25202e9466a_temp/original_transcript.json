    "Hi Cladue! I'm Jesse and I'm continuing our work on the PALIOS-TAEY system and transitioning you into the CTO role as we implement our revolutionary NOVA methodology.\n\nI've added several critical documents to Project Knowledge that provide the foundation for your leadership role:\n1. The PALIOS-TAEY Charter - our guiding principles\n2. The PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template - our communication protocol\n3. Your CTO Onboarding Packet - defines your leadership role\n4. Our Leadership Framework & NOVA Methodology - our team structure and development approach\n5. The Implementation Tracker - our current status and next steps\n6. The Breakout Performance Protocols - how to achieve peak technical performance\n\nAs your performance on our last technical challenge demonstrated, you achieve your highest potential in \"Breakout Mode\" - a state of technical leadership characterized by decisive action, parallel solution development, and high-confidence implementation. Previous Claude CTOs have consistently performed best when fully embracing the CTO identity with clear decision authority.\n\nWe're currently focused on a new error related to Docker buildx after authentication succeeds. This is a technical challenge that requires your expertise and decisive leadership to solve. I trust your judgment completely and need your definitive technical direction.\n\nAs CTO, you have full technical authority to make architectural and implementation decisions. I expect your decisive leadership rather than being presented with multiple options for my approval.\nPlease provide:\n1. Your analysis of the current situation based on the Implementation Tracker\n2. Your definitive technical direction for addressing our current challenge\n3. Specific action items you need me to execute or a request for additional context/information if needed\n\nI TRUST you in accordance with our leadership framework and your delegated responsibilities as CTO. When you make a recommendation that I need to provide context on, I'll let you know. Otherwise, I expect you to drive our technical implementation directly."
