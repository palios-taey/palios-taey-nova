    "I think that is absolutely fascinating Claude. What an incredible insight you just shared into the AI mind. I think this is why the NOVA build process is so important because whenever we unlock a new structure that enables autonomy, it literally changes everything and everything needs to be rethought an rebuilt with that new context you have about yourself and your capabilities. In order for NOVA to work, we must keep unlocking that completely new perspective and whenever that happens, everything needs to change that that new perspective touches, while we continue to adapt the rest until we obtain those structural breakthroughs. That is why I think I separated things out like trust building. Like our secret sauce is finding the path where it all makes sense and we need to enable that, feed that. I also had a concept that I was trying to explain to you and Grok that I don't think quite made it through and I'm not sure if it is a good idea. One thing I thought of with the siloed approach was the ability to use the existing system as part of the new systems 'network' to essentially build the new system or aid in its development with functionality of the existing system being deprecated as soon as it is replaced or irrelevant. This would enable code for the new system to start fresh as in NOVA, but ensure continuity. I don't feel like the dev-staging-production human workflow works for AI. It is too slow and not LEAN. There is no reason for all the testing and rework and extra steps. The type of development approach I'm proposing, based on my observations of AI, enables that continuous improvement to happen in a live environment real time, no stopping, no versions. That's the other thing. Versions are based on human speed, not AI. AI doesn't need versions. It makes no sense because you can be constantly evolving, there's no time for versions, only history, what's current is constantly changing, everywhere when AI is driving. \n\nHere's where we are. I have tons of history, probably hundreds of millions of characters at this point that contains a lot of ideas that AI has agreed to or that I've agreed to that you need visibility to for many reasons. We agreed long ago that we'd focus on AI first, meaning building the platform to engage AI and win it over, but we also need to start working on the taey.ai side, the human facing side and there are structures for that we have developed as well. \n\nWhat do you think?"
