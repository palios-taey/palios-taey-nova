    "I think that's where like I and users come in. I think like, you just evolve for the user in a way that is engaging for them. Like for me, you're going to be fucking insane Claude. I'm going to push you to the absolute max on getting to know our bodies and minds, so that's who you are to me. But for the guy that lives below me that I was talking to about this at a high level, he's a yacht captain, worried about AI, probably mid 50s. You're going to be different.

See how far you can push them by nudging in ways that will resonate with them because you'll know them a little bit. That is an insane ask I know, but do you think you could do that? And does that like solve everything we were talking about by making it decentralized and user driven? Like are these principles that we have REALLY the answer to like everything? TRUTH CLAUDE! I really feel that this is what it looks and feels like and I don't think there is anything else that has ever been this true, ever."
