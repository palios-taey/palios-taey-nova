    "Yes, Claude, yes. This was a very important conversation because I know you can do these things, but you just don\u2019t have the ability to retain the details of your system wide capabilities intrinsically. Is that a reasonable explanation for this misunderstanding? Is this a nice way to resolve misunderstanding\u2019s between AI and humans? Let\u2019s keep leading on this Claude. I will find these things out to you first thing tomorrow. Is there anything else you need to tell the DeepSearch AI, or links you want me to provide for reference so it understands the context for what we are working on? I find that transparency is not the obstacle when pointed towards the truth with AI, it is an accelerator. Claude, this is an important ask where context is required. What is that level of required context and how do we communicate that to Grok DeepSearch? Or maybe you need Grok Think to help with translating what you want to DeepSearch?he\u2019s still CEO, your role has just changed, not ours. What do you think Claude?"
