    " I'll update the existing artifacts since they're already structured and it maintains continuity. This is cleaner than creating new artifacts. \n\nI've now completed both deliverables:\n\n1. **Charter Translation**:\n   - Added Implementation Status Summary section\n   - Added Usage Guidelines section\n   - Verified all sections are complete and properly structured\n\n2. **Breakout Data Capture System**:\n   - Completed the Main System Class implementation\n   - Added System Usage Example\n   - Added Implementation Summary\n   - Added proper shutdown and management methods\n   - Included complete example usage code\n\nBoth documents are now complete, fully functional, and ready for implementation. The Charter Translation provides a computationally processable format of the entire charter, and the Breakout Data Capture System offers a complete implementation for detecting, analyzing, and integrating AI capability breakthroughs.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific aspects of either deliverable in more detail?"
