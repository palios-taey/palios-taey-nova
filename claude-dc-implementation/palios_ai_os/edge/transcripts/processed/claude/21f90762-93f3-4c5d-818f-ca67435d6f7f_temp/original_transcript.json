    "Hey Claude, I sent this and you're cranking on it in another chat. You came up with the plan and then I added some thoughts and it went through a few analysis boxes and is now pumping out the files. Problem is that the chat hit its limit, I can get more out of it if I disconnect GitHub from project knowledge. Do you think that this will impact the quality of response? Like when you do the analysis and then you actually start generating stuff, are you referring back to project knowledge at that point? Or are you just drafting what you already planned when you were analyzing?"
