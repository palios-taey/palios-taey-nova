    " I apologize for the file permission issue with main.tf. This sometimes happens when files are created through scripts or terminal commands on macOS. Let's fix this and move forward with a simpler approach.\n\n## Fixing the main.tf Issue\n\nTry this in terminal:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the terraform directory\ncd terraform\n\n# Fix file permissions\nchmod 644 main.tf\n\n# Try opening now\nopen main.tf\n```\n\nIf that doesn't work, we can create a new file with the proper permissions:\n\n```bash\n# Create a backup of the content\ncat main.tf > main.tf.backup\n\n# Remove the problematic file\nrm main.tf\n\n# Create a new file with the same content\ncat main.tf.backup > main.tf\n\n# Make sure it has the right permissions\nchmod 644 main.tf\n```\n\n## Simplified Approach\n\nSince the terminal scripts didn't work as expected, let's take a simpler approach. I'll provide clear step-by-step instructions with content to copy and paste:\n\n### 1. Create environment_config.py File\n\nCreate a new file in the src directory named `environment_config.py` with this content:\n\n```python\n# environment_config.py\nimport os\nimport logging\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Environment detection\ndef is_production():\n    \"\"\"Determine if running in production environment (Cloud Run)\"\"\"\n    return os.environ.get(\"K_SERVICE\") is not None\n\ndef get_project_id():\n    \"\"\"Get the GCP project ID\"\"\"\n    return os.environ.get(\"PROJECT_ID\", \"ai-execution-system\")\n\ndef use_mock_mode():\n    \"\"\"Determine if mock mode should be used\"\"\"\n    # In production, use mock mode only if explicitly set\n    if is_production():\n        return os.environ.get(\"USE_MOCK_RESPONSES\", \"False\").lower() == \"true\"\n    \n    # In development, default to mock mode for testing\n    return os.environ.get(\"USE_MOCK_RESPONSES\", \"True\").lower() == \"true\"\n\n# Initialize environment configuration\ndef initialize_environment():\n    \"\"\"Initialize environment configuration\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Set up environment variables\n        os.environ[\"USE_MOCK_RESPONSES\"] = str(use_mock_mode()).lower()\n        os.environ[\"PROJECT_ID\"] = get_project_id()\n        \n        # Set up Google Application Credentials if not in production\n        if not is_production() and \"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\" not in os.environ:\n            credential_paths = [\n                \"./credentials/service-account.json\",\n                \"./service-account.json\"\n            ]\n            \n            for path in credential_paths:\n                if os.path.exists(path):\n                    os.environ[\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\"] = path\n                    logger.info(f\"Set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to {path}\")\n                    break\n            \n        logger.info(f\"Environment initialized: production={is_production()}, mock={use_mock_mode()}, project={get_project_id()}\")\n        return True\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error initializing environment: {str(e)}\")\n        return False\n```\n\n### 2. Update main.py\n\nOpen main.py and add these lines at the top after the imports:\n\n```python\nimport environment_config\n\n# Initialize environment before any other components\nenvironment_config.initialize_environment()\n```\n\n### 3. Create Firestore Permissions File\n\nCreate a new file in the terraform directory named `firestore_permissions.tf` with this content:\n\n```terraform\n# Ensure Firestore API is enabled\nresource \"google_project_service\" \"firestore_api\" {\n  project = var.project_id\n  service = \"firestore.googleapis.com\"\n  \n  disable_dependent_services = false\n  disable_on_destroy         = false\n}\n\n# Ensure Cloud Run service account has Firestore access\nresource \"google_project_iam_binding\" \"firestore_access\" {\n  project = var.project_id\n  role    = \"roles/datastore.user\"\n  \n  members = [\n    \"serviceAccount:${google_service_account.palios_taey_service_account.email}\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Deployment\n\nAfter making these changes, commit and push:\n\n```bash\n# Add all changed files\ngit add .\n\n# Commit with a descriptive message\ngit commit -m \"Add environment configuration and Firestore integration\"\n\n# Push to trigger deployment\ngit push\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Let me know when you've completed these steps\n2. Once deployed, we'll verify that everything is working correctly by:\n   - Testing the deployed application with memory operations\n   - Checking the logs for any Firestore connection issues\n\nAs CTO, I'm focusing on ensuring we have a smooth deployment while minimizing your effort. These changes provide a central place for environment configuration that all modules can rely on, and ensure proper Firestore integration throughout the system."
