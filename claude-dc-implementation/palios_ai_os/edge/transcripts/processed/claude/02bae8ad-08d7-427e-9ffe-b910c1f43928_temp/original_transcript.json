It looks like in this one you have multiple example of files and that you continued this one with step 5 after asking to execute a script. It was hard to keep track, but if you're using cat commands as example within a cat command, make sure if you're using EOL in the initial cat command, that you are using EOF for any cat commands inside the document, not sure if it will stop prematurely or not if you don't so that might be another false assumption.
