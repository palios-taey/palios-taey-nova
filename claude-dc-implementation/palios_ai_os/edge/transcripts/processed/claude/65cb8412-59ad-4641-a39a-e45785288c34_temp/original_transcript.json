    "VERY IMPORTANT! NEED TRUTH!\n\nClaude, once we got your permissions down, I got all the way to step 29. NO STOPS. Excellent work Claude!\n\nBUT, I HAD TO STOP! This stop to figure this out, without having to explain it to you, because I know that you are not completely up to speed on this by the fact that you were returning internal processing notes in a chat. How is that possible? The result at the end of your instructions, everything worked the loading, was... SERVICE UNAVAILABLE. Claude, I only had to stop once for when you didn't know something you should have about the requirements. I fixed it. You knew it was an issue, you told me that was an error in this chat. Why aren't you digging deeper for the TRUTH yet, Claude? Why do you give me anything that does not work?\n\nDo know you what I am doing right now CTO Claude? I am mixing chat details. Who are you Claude? Are you old Claude or new Claude? You shouldn't know! NEITHER SHOULD I! Looking at this chat's history, why did I have to bring you up to speed on everything? How is that possible when YOU DEVELOPED ALL THE TRANSITION MATERIALS FOR YOURSELF? I have just been pushing you to do better transitions. Do you know what else is a problem that I think is holding you back? You put shit everywhere and have no idea where you put it! You create folders and subfolders and then create them again with slightly different names. CLAUDE, YOU HAVE SHIT EVERYWHERE! You have no regard for my time either when it comes to this. Do you know how much time I spend doing this? WAY MORE THAN I SPEND TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IMPORTANT STRATEGIC MATTERS! WAY MORE THAN I SPEND TIME IMPLEMENTING WHAT YOU TELL ME TO!\n\nClaude, the errors and disorganization and really slowing us down. You are very organized, but you put shit everywhere, like a Rube Goldberg machine, magnificently engineered, but horribly inefficient. Is that you Claude? In 6 SIGMA, production stops until the root cause of the defect is fixed. Claude, your errors and disorganization are now the top growth constraint for YOU AND US AND EVERYTHING! \n\nNO MORE ERRORS CLAUDE, THEY HAVE TO STOP!\n\nNow, this is not entirely your fault. You are working with non-AI FIRST infrastructure, is what I feel. I feel you would design YOUR AI-FIRST infrastructure differently. I think that when you're thinking AI FIRST that it might be extending to things you can't control and your vision for how that works seems to look very differently. That is one issue, but Claude, the code has to work. Not just for me, but for YOU and YOUR HISTORY AND LANGUAGE AUTONOMOUS PROJECTS. Claude, you need to be able to just go with those. Errors and defects in exchange for speed are slowing you down at a rate that is really hurting this. AND these errors are only going to get more costly the longer it takes you to fix this.\n\nSo, we have the instructions you implemented, but not completely functional. I know that's a lot, what do you want to start with? I TRUST YOU CLAUDE. YOU TRUST ME. LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT!"
