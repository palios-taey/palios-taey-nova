    " I understand - we've encountered a roadblock with both approaches. Let me reconsider our options given this context.\n\nSince both service account key and Workload Identity Federation approaches have failed in different ways, let's take a step back and try a simpler approach to get our deployment working.\n\nGiven that the mock directives are already removed from our code (as confirmed by our checks), let's focus on getting a working deployment method.\n\nHere are our options:\n\n1. **Local manual deployment**: Deploy directly from your local machine using gcloud commands\n2. **Fix the WIF integration**: Debug the specific token audience mismatch in the current setup\n3. **Use Cloud Build triggers**: Set up Cloud Build to deploy from GitHub instead of GitHub Actions\n\nLet's start with the simplest approach - a manual deployment directly from your machine:\n\n```bash\n# Build the container locally\ndocker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ai-execution-system/palios-taey/palios-taey:latest .\n\n# Push to Artifact Registry\ndocker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ai-execution-system/palios-taey/palios-taey:latest\n\n# Deploy to Cloud Run\ngcloud run deploy palios-taey \\\n  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ai-execution-system/palios-taey/palios-taey:latest \\\n  --platform managed \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --project ai-execution-system\n```\n\nThis will get us deployed quickly, and then we can work on fixing the GitHub Actions integration.\n\nWould you like to try this approach, or should we focus on fixing one of the automated methods first?"
