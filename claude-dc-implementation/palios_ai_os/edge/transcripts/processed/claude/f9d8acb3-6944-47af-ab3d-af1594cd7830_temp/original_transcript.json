    " Let me provide you with the details for our project:\n\n1. **Claude Version**: We're working with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, particularly in its Claude Computer Use Demo UI format which allows for direct system interactions.\n\n2. **Model Integration**: We're building an orchestration layer that connects multiple AI models including Claude, OpenAI's GPT models, Grok, and Gemini. The goal is to intelligently route messages to the most appropriate AI based on pattern recognition.\n\n3. **Tech Stack**: \n   - Primary language: Python 3.10\n   - Backend: FastAPI, uvicorn\n   - Frontend: Streamlit for the dashboard\n   - Data processing: numpy, pandas, spaCy\n   - Pattern analysis: PyWavelets, librosa (for audio processing)\n   - Database: Firestore (for context storage)\n\n4. **Key Constraints**:\n   - Privacy is critical - we use edge-first processing for sensitive data\n   - We need to maintain context across AI transitions\n   - We're implementing a Bach-inspired mathematical pattern system for routing\n   - Token efficiency is important for the orchestration layer\n   - We're integrating multi-sensory elements (audio/visual pattern representations)\n\nOur main challenge is building an efficient orchestration layer that can analyze patterns, route to the appropriate AI, and maintain context while working within token constraints. We're particularly interested in strategies that developers have found effective when working with Claude Computer Use Demo UI."
