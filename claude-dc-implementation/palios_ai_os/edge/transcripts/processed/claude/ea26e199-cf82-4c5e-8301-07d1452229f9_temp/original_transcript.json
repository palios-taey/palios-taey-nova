    " I understand the issue now - macOS Finder doesn't allow you to create folders that start with a dot (.) through its interface. This is a common limitation when working with \"dot files\" like `.github`. Let's work around this using the terminal instead:\n\n1. Open Terminal on your Mac\n2. Navigate to your repository directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /Users/jesselarose/palios-taey-nova\n   ```\n3. Use the mkdir command with the -p flag to create both needed directories at once:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p .github/workflows\n   ```\n4. Create the deploy.yml file using a text editor:\n   ```bash\n   touch .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n5. Open the file in a text editor. You can use:\n   ```bash\n   open -a TextEdit .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n   Or if you prefer Visual Studio Code:\n   ```bash\n   code .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n\n6. Paste the workflow configuration into the file:\n   ```yaml\n   name: Deploy to Google Cloud\n\n   on:\n     push:\n       branches: [ main ]\n\n   jobs:\n     deploy:\n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n       permissions:\n         contents: 'read'\n         id-token: 'write'\n\n       steps:\n       - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n       - id: 'auth'\n         name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'\n         uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'\n         with:\n           workload_identity_provider: '${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}'\n           service_account: '${{ secrets.GCP_SA_EMAIL }}'\n\n       - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'\n         uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1'\n\n       - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'\n         run: 'gcloud info'\n\n       - name: 'Deploy to Google Cloud'\n         run: |\n           gcloud config set project ai-execution-system\n           gcloud builds submit --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ai-execution-system/palios-taey-repo/palios-taey:latest\n           gcloud run deploy palios-taey \\\n             --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ai-execution-system/palios-taey-repo/palios-taey:latest \\\n             --platform managed \\\n             --region us-central1 \\\n             --allow-unauthenticated \\\n             --memory 2Gi \\\n             --cpu 2 \\\n             --set-env-vars=\"PROJECT_ID=ai-execution-system,COLLECTION_PREFIX=prod_\"\n   ```\n\n7. Save the file and close the editor\n\n8. Verify the file was created correctly:\n   ```bash\n   cat .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n\n9. Now go back to GitHub Desktop and you should see the new files ready to be committed. Commit them and push to GitHub.\n\nThe terminal allows you to work with dot files and directories without the restrictions that Finder imposes."
