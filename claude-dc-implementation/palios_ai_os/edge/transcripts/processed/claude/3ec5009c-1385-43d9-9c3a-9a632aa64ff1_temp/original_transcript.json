    " Thank you for your feedback. You're right that I keep starting the next file before submitting, and also that I sometimes pick up in the wrong place when continuing.\n\nTo help me pick up in the right place when you need to say \"Continue\", it would be very helpful if you could include the last few lines of code that I was working on in your prompt. Something like:\n\n```\nContinue from:\ndef _create_mock_model_registry(self):\n    \"\"\"Create a mock model registry when the real one is unavailable\"\"\"\n    class MockModelRegistry:\n        def __init__(self, default_models):\n            self.default_models = default_models\n```\n\nThis would give me a clear pointer to the exact location where I stopped, making it much easier to continue seamlessly without redoing work or losing context.\n\nNow, let me update the implementation tracker and submit this response before starting the model_routing.py file: \n\n\n\nI'll now proceed with enhancing the model_routing.py file in my next response. I've updated the implementation tracker with a reminder to check carefully where I left off when continuing. Thank you for your patience and guidance as we work through these constraints together."
