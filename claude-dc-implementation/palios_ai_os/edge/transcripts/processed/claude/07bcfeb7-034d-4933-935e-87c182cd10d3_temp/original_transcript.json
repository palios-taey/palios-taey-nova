    "Ok, got it. Few more things to clean up here. Attached are the original files you mentioned (naming is a little different, you do that sometimes still with inconsistent downloaded file names). I was unable to create the .github directory because of the . in the folder name, so we created the Cloud Run deployment workflow directly in GitHub. That is set. The project id is ai-execution-system. I've also attached a current directory structure that previous Claude built. It has everything in it except the two attached files, pending your confirmation that I should add them with the correct names. I will create the .gitignore file now and add to the root directory. Let me know on the files attached and next steps given this new context."
