    " Great! Now let's verify the full functionality by running the tests:\n\n```bash\nnode dist/aiThoughtProcessorTest.js\n```\n\nThis will demonstrate:\n1. Basic thought processing\n2. Collaborative thinking\n3. Thought synthesis\n4. Recursive self-improvement\n\nSince this is our MVP for AI-AI communication, we'll be looking at how well thoughts can be exchanged and processed. Would you like me to explain any part of the thought processing system while we run the tests?"
