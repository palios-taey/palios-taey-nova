    " Thank you for sharing the output. I notice the command completes without showing either success or error messages. Let's verify the compilation was successful by checking if the JavaScript files were generated in the dist directory.\n\nCould you please check if:\n1. The dist folder was created\n2. It contains coreProtocol.js and integration-tests.js\n\nYou can check this with:\n```bash\ndir dist\n```\n\nAlso, let's try running the tests to confirm everything is working:\n```bash\nnode dist/integration-tests.js\n```\n\nIf you don't see the files in dist or encounter any errors running the tests, please let me know and I'll help troubleshoot. We may need to:\n1. Verify tsconfig.json is properly configured\n2. Ensure all dependencies are properly resolved\n3. Check if the TypeScript compiler is finding our source files\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any specific verification steps?"
