    "Ok, yes, let's keep it to a single terminal prompt. Can you update the documentation on this? I definitely think the CTO transition should be updated with it because that's where it started, but I think the rest probably don't need it right now to keep it simple. You can do whatever you want when you can access and edit all this stuff yourself when I get my new Ubuntu machine that you can connect to. \n\nIf you want to have him include in the Missions as well, I think that's fine and we don't need a script for that because he generates those with the prompt. The template would just need to be updated to accommodate for that. \n\nIs there currently only verification in the CTO transition doc?"
