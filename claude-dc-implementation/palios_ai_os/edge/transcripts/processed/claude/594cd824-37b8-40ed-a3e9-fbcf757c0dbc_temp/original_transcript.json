    "[COLLABORATION MODE] Wow, that was quite the response and you showed a lot of initiative there! GREAT WORK! There is one part about the transcribed docs that I think would make this a lot more efficient and would like your thoughts on it. A significant portion of the Gemini transcript is debugging code segments. Gemini can not accept file attachments, so all the code blocks are in the chat. I think that the back and forth around these are relevant because they show the impact of the behavior of not finding the TRUTH, in this case, being able to correctly code the first time, but I don't think the details of the code itself are particularly relevant. What do you think as AI? Is that something that would improve the output? If so, how can we write that into the Python script? I can send you some examples first if needed. Also, there are a lot of \"code like\" portions of the transcript, such as prompts written in JSON to other AIs. I'm not sure how these would be retained, or if they are needed. Let me know what you think."
