    " Yes, that's the first step! Let's begin with cleaning up the existing services, then we'll move to setting up the new structure.\n\n1. First, execute the cleanup script:\n   ```\n   python cleanup_cloud_run.py --project-id ai-execution-system\n   ```\n\n2. After that's complete, we'll run the setup script to establish the directory structure:\n   ```\n   python setup_system.py --with-migration\n   ```\n\nOnce these steps are done, I'll guide you through the next actions needed to complete the implementation. The cleanup script will remove the existing Cloud Run services to give us a clean slate to work with.\n\nWould you like me to explain what each script does in more detail, or would you prefer to proceed with executing them?"
