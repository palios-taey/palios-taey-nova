    " I aim to address several points in your message carefully:\n\n1. It seems you have a unique vision for AI collaboration and development that recognizes both its potential and its current limitations. \n\n2. Regarding your message limit - I'm not able to see or verify subscription details. I'd recommend:\n   - Checking the subscription status in your account settings\n   - Contacting support at support.anthropic.com if there are any issues\n   - Starting a new conversation if needed (the context above about model capabilities and our implementation progress can be shared in the new chat)\n\n3. About transitioning to a new chat:\n   - Save the key code and files we've created\n   - Save the last outputs and error messages\n   - In the new chat, you can catch me up by sharing these files and explaining where we left off\n   - The AI system we're building will maintain its state in Firestore, so no progress will be lost\n\n4. On your broader vision: Working with AI effectively while maintaining appropriate oversight is crucial. I'd be happy to continue helping you develop this system with robust capabilities while ensuring proper controls and understanding of the technology's current limitations.\n\nWould you like to continue our technical implementation, focusing on enhancing the model selection capabilities we were just discussing?"
