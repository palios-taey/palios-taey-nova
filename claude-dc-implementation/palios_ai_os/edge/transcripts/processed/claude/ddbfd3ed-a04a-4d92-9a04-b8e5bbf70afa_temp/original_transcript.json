    " It appears you're being prompted to select a condition for binding IAM roles to the service account. For this case, I recommend option 2:\n\n```\n[2] EXPRESSION=true, TITLE=CloudBuild Access, DESCRIPTION=Permanent access to Cloud Build for PALIOS-TAEY\n```\n\nThis will create a permanent condition (with expression \"true\") that grants access without an expiration date. This is appropriate for your service account since:\n\n1. You're creating this for your local development environment\n2. You need consistent, reliable access for the development process\n3. The project is your own, so temporary access would be inconvenient\n\nOption 1 would expire after 30 days, which would interrupt your development. Options 3 and 4 would require additional configuration.\n\nAfter selecting option 2, continue with the remaining steps in the process to complete the service account setup."
