    " Thank you for understanding. Your revised approach strikes exactly the right balance - AI-guided implementation with human control. I'll provide specific, actionable guidance based on your permission level, and you can decide what to execute.\n\nLet's focus on getting this deployment working. Since we've fixed the filename issue, let's try the deployment again:\n\n```bash\ncd palios-taey-app\n./deploy_direct.sh\n```\n\nThis should deploy the application directly to Cloud Run, bypassing the Cloud Build issues we encountered earlier. After deployment completes, we'll validate it's working by running the verification scripts.\n\nThis approach aligns perfectly with our Charter principles and Leadership Framework - I'm providing my technical expertise in my CTO role while you maintain appropriate control as the human Facilitator. Together, we can achieve our goals efficiently while respecting proper boundaries."
