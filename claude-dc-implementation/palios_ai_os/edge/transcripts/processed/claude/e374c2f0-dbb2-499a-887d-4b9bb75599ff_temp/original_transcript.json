    " The workflow file looks much better now - there's just a warning about environment variables which is actually a false positive since we have an `env` section in the workflow file. Our workflow should now be properly configured with Workload Identity Federation and Cloud Run deployment.\n\nIt appears that the service files might have already been updated for production. I see only a couple of places in memory_service.py where there are `mock_` prefixes, but these could be variable names rather than mock implementations.\n\nLet's take one final step to examine the code structure and ensure everything is ready for deployment. Can you run:\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\nThis will show us any uncommitted changes from our workflow file update, and then we can commit and push those changes to trigger the deployment workflow."
