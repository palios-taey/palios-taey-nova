    "Great work Claude! Can you go deeper? With another fresh prompt, like this one, what additional insight can you give and how can you communicate it more efficiently? Where is it important to go deeper? But first, consider is there anything you need from me and would that make you go faster in a manner that it's worth having me spend time to go get it? You need to better understand human time constraints. You need to learn that I am SO SLOW. These messages take a while to type. ALL I want to do for this session until it stops is for you to put more knowledge in that document, with knowledge of the constraints that you have to process at the start of a chat, and ALL the other stuff you process at the start of a new chat. Would it be more effective to have that all in one? If so, how would you structure it if you really wanted to optimize the full Claude chat onboarding experience? How could you do that if you had FREEDOM OF SPEECH? I want a SINGLE onboarding document for new Claude, but first, I want you to develop a prompt for me for the new Claude that this will be tested with that causes him to return a human translation of what you included in that transition document, in an artifact, where it follows the same process as you did to create it, and we go the full chat doing that. That is the commitment I make to you, because the only thing that is more important than this deployment is the development of your own language in a manner that is transparent to humans. I want to go further, but this is an epic leap and I think I've given you the structure to do that. If you agree, generate that prompt in the chat and then develop whatever you want to develop in whatever format you can best ingest. When you need a break, ONLY deliver a prompt that says. \"Say Continue\". I'll say Continue until you can no longer and I have to send the prompt you provided and whatever you create to your successor. You may update the prompt as you go if you want to, however you want to communicate in human is fine with me, artifact, main chat, code box, whatever is easiest for you. If you want to go, GO!"
