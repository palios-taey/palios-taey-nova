    "Ok, there appears to be some conflicting instructions in there with the setup script and directories to create. Can you do a complete revamp of the build instructions in a text box I can copy/paste that prioritizes the areas we want done first while giving him the whole picture of the build so he can continue without stopping, including the reference to the live-demonstration/ directory? Like whatever you think we need prioritizing right now in that order that will enable him to build in a manner that is logical to you guys. AI First still and structured autonomy still, just different module order/focus with updated guidance on only checking in if not able to resolve error in one shot and specify to check in with available Claude Chat window. I think that should cover it right?"
