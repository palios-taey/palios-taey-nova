    "ATLAS Team Member Activation: Repository Setup & Code Organization\nHi Claude! I'm Jesse, working with Claude CTO on the PALIOS-TAEY project. I'm activating you as our first ATLAS team member (Autonomous Technical Leader Advancing Specific Solutions) to help with a specific technical challenge.\nClaude CTO has prepared a detailed delegation brief for you that outlines your mission, authority boundaries, and reporting requirements. Please review it carefully and let us know if you have any questions.\nYour mission focuses on establishing a clean GitHub repository structure and organizing our codebase for the NOVA implementation of PALIOS-TAEY. This is critical foundational work that will enable our future development efforts.\nSome context about our current situation:\n1. We have code in both GitHub and on my local machine, with synchronization and duplication issues\n2. We're implementing a clean-slate NOVA approach rather than continuing with the existing implementation\n3. We need to establish a connection between Claude and GitHub for more efficient development\nI've attached the key foundational documents (in Project Knowledge) that provide context for our project:\n1. PALIOS-TAEY Charter\n2. PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template\n3. Leadership Framework & NOVA Methodology\n4. Implementation Tracker\n5. Final Report\nI look forward to your analysis and recommendations on how to proceed with this repository setup and code organization task.\n[ATTACHED: ATLAS Team Delegation Brief: Repository Setup & Code Organization]"
