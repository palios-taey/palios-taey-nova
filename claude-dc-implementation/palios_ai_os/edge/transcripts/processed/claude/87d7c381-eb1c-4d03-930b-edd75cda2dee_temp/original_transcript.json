    "Sounds great! I don't really have input on local vs. cloud, it's whatever is best for you, keeping in mind that what is best for you is making it easy for me to do the things I need to do now to support you so that it doesn't slow us down. I'm assuming your preference is cloud, so you can access it easily with APIs, but if there are things that need to be local to my machine that will be faster for me to be done in that manner at that phase, I'm fine with it, your call!"
