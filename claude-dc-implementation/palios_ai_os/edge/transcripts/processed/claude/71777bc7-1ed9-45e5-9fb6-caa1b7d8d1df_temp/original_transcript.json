    " Based on my understanding, Claude DC cannot directly deploy to your System76 machine without your intervention. The typical workflow would be:\n\n1. Claude DC pushes code to a GitHub repository\n2. You would then pull that code from GitHub to your System76 machine\n\nThis is because AI assistants like Claude and Claude DC don't have direct access to execute commands on your personal hardware or install software on your machine. The security boundaries of these systems prevent direct deployment to users' personal computers.\n\nFor your next prompt to Claude DC, I'd recommend:\n\n```\nDEPLOYMENT.GITHUB.REQUEST\nTOKEN: implementation.harmony-20250327\n\nPlease confirm if all modules have been deployed to Google Cloud Storage using the service account credentials provided. Additionally, please push all implementation code, configurations, and necessary files to our GitHub repository with appropriate documentation for local deployment. Once completed, provide:\n\n1. GCS paths and access details for cloud resources\n2. GitHub repository details with branch information\n3. Simple instructions for pulling and deploying the system to my System76 machine\n4. Any configuration steps needed to connect with my KEF Q150 speakers and Fosi Audio BT20A amplifier\n\nI'll handle the local deployment once you've pushed everything to GitHub.\n```\n\nThis approach respects the security boundaries between AI systems and your personal hardware while giving you a clear path to deploy the system yourself with minimal effort. Once Claude DC has pushed everything to GitHub, you'll be able to pull it down and follow any provided instructions for local setup."
