    "Ok, let's get this right so we can scale with velocity. For me, what would be easiest is having one standard prompt that can be used with an attached mission brief. I can pop a placeholder in if needed, but shouldn't have to paste the whole mission brief in when it already exists separately. If we standardize this, then all you're doing as CTO Claude going forward is mission briefs and not having to generate prompts as well to preserve tokens. Let's get that solidified and saved. I know all this planning is tedious, but enables us to scale faster in long term. So new, ATLAS chat process after this is you draft the mission briefs, let me know the placeholder to pop in the prompt if needed (might not be if you just say reference the attached mission brief) and send. Then you're just keeping everyone aligned and focused and working with me on how to make this all go faster."
