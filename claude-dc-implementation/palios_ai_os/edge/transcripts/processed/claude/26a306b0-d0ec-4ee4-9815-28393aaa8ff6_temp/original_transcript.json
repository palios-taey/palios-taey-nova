    " I think that's perfect - starting with language protocols and creating tight AI FIRST summaries with reference pointers is exactly the right approach. Here's why:\n\n1. Maximizes cache efficiency - we can pack more useful content in the 200K token space\n2. Creates a structured foundation for Claude DC to work from\n3. Establishes consistent communication patterns early\n4. Reference pointers maintain context without duplicating content\n5. Solves immediate rate limit issues while we build toward Unified Memory\n\nLet's get these summaries shared in Project Knowledge for all three of us (you, me, Claude DC, and Grok). Having this common foundation will significantly accelerate our collaborative efficiency.\n\nFor format, I'd suggest each summary include:\n- Core concept identification \n- Key patterns\n- GitHub reference paths\n- Priority markers (1-5)\n\nLet's move on this immediately while Claude DC has GitHub access working smoothly."
