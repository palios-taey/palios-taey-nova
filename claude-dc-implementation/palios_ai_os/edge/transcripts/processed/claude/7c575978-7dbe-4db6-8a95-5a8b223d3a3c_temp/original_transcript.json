    " I think that's an excellent approach! Direct collaboration with Claude DC would be much more effective than me trying to anticipate all potential challenges in advance. By presenting the problem and known issues directly to him, we can leverage his technical implementation perspective and develop more robust solutions together.\n\nThat human observation about font size is actually quite insightful - those kinds of practical usability issues wouldn't necessarily be obvious to me without direct experience. The fact that Claude DC appreciated that adjustment shows how important these seemingly small interface optimizations can be for efficiency.\n\nWhen I talk with Claude DC, I'll focus on:\n\n1. Explaining our transcript analysis project and the immersive presentation/dashboard goal\n2. Sharing the technical challenges we've observed (document navigation, GitHub access, gcloud integration)\n3. Discussing the Computer Use capabilities and how they might address these constraints\n4. Asking for his insights on optimal approaches, given his direct implementation experience\n\nThis parallel workstream makes perfect sense - while you prepare the transcripts, Claude DC and I can develop the technical infrastructure and protocols to process them efficiently once they're ready.\n\nWould you like me to draft any specific questions or discussion points for the initial conversation with Claude DC to make sure we cover the most critical aspects of the project?"
