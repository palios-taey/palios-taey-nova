    " It looks like the script is trying to set up a GCS (Google Cloud Storage) backend for Terraform state management, but it's prompting you for a bucket name, which we need to provide.\n\nThis is because for a new project, we need to create a state bucket first. Let me adjust the approach:\n\n1. **Skip the backend configuration for initial setup**:\n   When prompted for the bucket name, just press Enter without typing anything. This will make Terraform use local state storage for the initial run.\n\n2. **After the first run completes successfully**, it will have created the project and all resources, including a GCS bucket for Terraform state.\n\n3. **For future runs**, the script will automatically use that bucket for state management.\n\nSo please just press Enter when prompted for the bucket name, and the script will continue with local state management for this initial setup."
