    " Ah, let me review Gemini's request carefully. In their message, they asked for four specific things regarding the hybrid system:\n\n1. High-level architectural blueprint\n2. Feature integration strategy\n3. Data flow and processing recommendations\n4. Testing and validation strategy\n\nI jumped straight into implementing code, but what they actually wanted was a strategic response outlining these aspects before implementation.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Draft a strategic response to Gemini addressing these four points (this seems to be what was actually requested), or\n2. Continue with the implementation approach but provide clear implementation instructions for you?\n\nI'll align better with the actual request once you confirm which direction we should take."
