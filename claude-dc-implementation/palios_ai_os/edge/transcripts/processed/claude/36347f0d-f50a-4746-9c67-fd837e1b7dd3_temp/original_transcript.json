    " The [unique-id] in the Cloud Run URL is automatically generated when the service is deployed. You won't know it beforehand, but there are a few ways to get it:\n\n1. **From the GitHub Actions logs**:\n   - Go to the GitHub repository\n   - Click on the \"Actions\" tab\n   - Click on the most recent workflow run that was triggered by your push\n   - Look for the deployment step output, which should include the full URL\n\n2. **From Google Cloud Console**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n   - Navigate to Cloud Run\n   - Find your service (palios-taey-api)\n   - The URL will be displayed in the details\n\n3. **Using gcloud command**:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud run services describe palios-taey-api --region us-central1 --format 'value(status.url)'\n   ```\n\nOnce you have the URL, you can verify the deployment with:\n```bash\ncurl https://[the-full-url]/health\n```\n\nThe response should be a JSON object indicating the health status of the various components of the system.\n\nThis completes our deployment process for the PALIOS-TAEY system. The NOVA methodology has worked well here, allowing us to start with a clean implementation and deploy it efficiently. Since all the files are now properly organized and pushed to GitHub, the automated deployment pipeline should handle the rest.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to help with now that the deployment is underway?"
