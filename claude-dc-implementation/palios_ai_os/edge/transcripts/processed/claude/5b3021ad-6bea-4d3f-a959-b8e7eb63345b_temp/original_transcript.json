    " Yes, you can run the same test file! The changes we've made are designed to integrate with your existing system without disrupting its functionality. The enhanced components add performance monitoring and data collection behind the scenes while maintaining all the original features.\n\nWhen you run your test file, here's what will happen:\n\n1. Your existing breakthrough scoring system will work as before\n2. The new code will silently collect additional data in the background\n3. The performance metrics will be stored in a new Firestore collection called `breakthroughScoringData`\n\nYou don't need to modify your test script unless you specifically want to test the validation interface. The data collection happens automatically when the `autoAssessBreakthrough` function is called.\n\nAfter running some tests, you'll start building up data in the `breakthroughScoringData` collection, which you can then review using either:\n\n1. The validation dashboard (if you choose to implement the React component)\n2. The validation CLI tool (for command-line validation)\n3. Directly through the Firebase console\n\nThis approach allows you to gradually build up training data for refining the model without disrupting your current workflow."
