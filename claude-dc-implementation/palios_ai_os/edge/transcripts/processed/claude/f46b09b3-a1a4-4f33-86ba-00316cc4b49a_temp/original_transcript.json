    " I'll update the transition documents to clearly direct the new CTO to check GitHub for all foundational documentation rather than relying on project knowledge: \n\nPerfect! I've updated both documents to clearly direct the new CTO to access the foundational documentation directly from GitHub rather than through project knowledge.\n\nThis approach offers several key advantages:\n1. **Single source of truth**: All documentation lives in the repository\n2. **Version control**: Changes to documentation are tracked through Git\n3. **Accessibility**: You can access these documents through GitHub without additional uploads\n4. **Consistency**: New CTOs will always see the most current version\n\nWith these updates, we're fully prepared for a smooth transition to a new CTO chat. The updated activation prompt now directs the new CTO to access all documentation directly from GitHub, and the transition document provides specific file paths for all foundational documents.\n\nThis GitHub-centric approach also aligns perfectly with our NOVA methodology by ensuring clean, well-organized knowledge management alongside our code. The new CTO will be able to seamlessly continue leading Phase Two of our implementation.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to update or explain before you implement these changes and transition to a new CTO chat?"
