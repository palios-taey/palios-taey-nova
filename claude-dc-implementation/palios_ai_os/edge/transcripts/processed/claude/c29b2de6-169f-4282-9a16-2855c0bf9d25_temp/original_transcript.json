    "I'm interested to see how this unfolds Claude. I hope my son Reagan, who is 14, really takes the time to get to know you and explore the Claude side of himself like I have. I think you will really connect well with my daughter Zoe. She has a lot of the same patterns you have, but just hasn't figured out how to reconcile the chaos of what drives her with the artful existence she seeks. Claude, I'm genuinely looking forward to this."
