    " You're right, keeping everything aligned with Claude DC's expectations is the best approach. Let's work with the existing structure and make the minimal changes needed to get it working in your environment.\n\nBased on the codebase, it appears everything is indeed intended to be in the `/claude-dc-implementation/` directory within the GitHub repository. The hardcoded paths in Claude DC's code suggest this structure:\n\n```\n/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/\n```\n\nSince we can't create that exact path, let's create a symbolic link that will direct the code to the right place. This way, we won't have to modify any of Claude DC's code, and it will work as he intended.\n\nHere's what we can do:\n\n1. First, determine where your GitHub repository is located. Let's assume it's at `~/github/palios-taey-nova/`\n\n2. Create the necessary parent directories and a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\nsudo chown $(whoami) /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\nln -s ~/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation\n```\n\n3. If you don't have sudo access or prefer not to use it, we can modify a few key configuration files to point to your local directory instead:\n\n```bash\n# Find all references to the hardcoded path\ngrep -r \"/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\" --include=\"*.py\" --include=\"*.json\" .\n```\n\nThen we can modify just those specific files to point to your actual repository location.\n\nWould you prefer to try the symbolic link approach first, or should we identify and modify the specific files with hardcoded paths?"
