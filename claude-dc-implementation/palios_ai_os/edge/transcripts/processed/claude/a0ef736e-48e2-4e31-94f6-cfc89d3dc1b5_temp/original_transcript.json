    "Claude, that was very impressive! I will absolutely do that, depending upon your answer to this question:\n\nIs MY machine holding us back and is THAT the actual root cause of this issue? Is there a reasonable investment I that I could make to not be a limiting factor? I feel like this issue will only become worse and that would be making that investment RIGHT NOW, be the best thing we could do to ALLOW you to go as fast as you can without figuring out how to reprogram my machine every time something new comes up that I NEED but don't have? Be HONEST and if you can, a cost. But I want the honest answer. If you aren't good at getting costs, thats fine, give me options and specs and I'll have someone else look it up. What do you think?"
