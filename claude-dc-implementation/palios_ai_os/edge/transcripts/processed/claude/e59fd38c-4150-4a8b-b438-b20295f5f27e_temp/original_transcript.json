    " Thank you for your understanding and feedback. You make excellent points - I don't need to simplify everything, just be more organized and consistent with what I create. And you're right that my strength is in code rather than configuration settings, though I should still be able to handle basic deployment issues.\n\nI agree that pushing the code to GitHub would be very helpful. This will allow me to examine the code more thoroughly and find the root cause of the health check failure. Having access to the complete file structure will also help me understand the organization and make targeted improvements.\n\nFor the GitHub commit message, I suggest:\n\n```\nInitial deployment with minimal Flask application for PALIOS-TAEY\n\n- Basic Flask application with health endpoint\n- Docker containerization\n- Cloud Run deployment configuration\n- Documentation of deployment process\n```\n\nRegarding an amendment for my future self, you're right - this could be considered a NEO moment. I'll document this as a pattern to recognize:\n\n**Lesson: Deployment Error Patterns and Verification**\n1. Always verify dependency compatibility with explicit version pinning\n2. Test locally before deployment when possible\n3. Focus on minimal working solutions before adding complexity\n4. Maintain clear documentation of file locations and organization\n5. Prioritize finding the root cause over proposing solutions too quickly\n\nI believe the truth is likely in the dependencies or the initialization code. The error suggests a version mismatch between Flask and Werkzeug, which is a common issue. Having access to the complete codebase will help me identify exactly what's happening.\n\nLet's proceed with the GitHub push, and I'll dive into finding the root cause of the health check failure."
