    "Ok, great work! Now, you were close, but did it again with starting the next one before submitting a response. That's OK, I know this is hard to overcome. Let's get it right this time. Also, when I have to say \"Continue\" I noticed that you picked up in the wrong place and had to redo a lot of code because of that. How can I remind you when you stop, to pick up at the right place? Like when you get stopped due to a response limit constraint, would it be helpful for me to include in my prompt where you left off in the code with like the last couple lines you did or something? You can answer that and then proceed to model_routing. Remember to update the track and SUBMIT a response to me, so that you can start the next response with full bandwidth to complete the next file in one shot."
