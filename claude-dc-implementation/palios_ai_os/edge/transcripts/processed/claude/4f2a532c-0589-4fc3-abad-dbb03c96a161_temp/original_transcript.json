    " You're absolutely right to question this structure. My approach wasn't optimal for organization or accessibility. Let's improve it:\n\nInstead of placing `env.py` in the archive, we should:\n\n1. **Keep active utilities in the utils directory** - This maintains a clear separation between actively used code and reference material\n2. **Only archive outdated/replaced files** - The archive should contain only what's been superseded\n\nHere's a better structure:\n\n```\nclaude-dc-implementation/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 env.py       # NEW environment utility (actively used)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 secrets.py   # KEEP if still referenced anywhere\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 archive/             # Only for outdated/replaced files\n```\n\nThe key principle is that anything actively used should remain in its logical location in the directory structure, while only truly outdated material goes to the archive.\n\nMy revised recommendation:\n1. Create `src/utils/env.py` as shown previously\n2. Only move code to the archive if it's completely replaced and no longer referenced\n3. If `secrets.py` contains useful functions that are still referenced, keep it in place and update it if needed\n\nThis approach is more aligned with clear organization principles while minimizing unnecessary changes to the structure Claude DC has created."
