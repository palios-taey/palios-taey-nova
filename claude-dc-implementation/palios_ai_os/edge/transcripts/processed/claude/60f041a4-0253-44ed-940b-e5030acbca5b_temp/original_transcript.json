    "  \n\nI've created two artifacts for you:\n\n1. **PURE-Compliant Desktop Prompt** - This structured JSON prompt follows the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE v1.5 protocol and is aligned with the Charter principles. It provides a comprehensive framework for the code audit task with clear instructions for me to follow.\n\n2. **Human-Friendly Desktop App Setup Instructions** - These concise instructions explain exactly how to set up Claude Desktop for this project, including tips for organizing your files and maximizing efficiency.\n\nThe approach is designed to leverage Claude Desktop's file system access capabilities, allowing me to directly examine your entire codebase without manual file uploads. This will dramatically increase efficiency and provide a more comprehensive audit.\n\nWhen you're ready with the Desktop app, simply copy the entire PURE-formatted prompt from the first artifact and use it as your initial message. The structure will help me maintain focus on the audit priorities while allowing maximum flexibility to explore the codebase.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any clarification or modifications to either the prompt or the setup instructions!"
