    "I think it's GREAT! First, we need to find a better balance for the human labor side of this. I'd like to avoid editing directly in the document and prefer to use a system of tags as you suggest. Editing each section will take way more time and this is already going to be time intensive. My suggestion is to do more of the consolidation approach with a guide to the tags that can be more comprehensive than I initially suggested, but enable me to just tag transcripts that relate to those more defined and expansive tags. We can work on this iteratively together to develop the best system.\n\nYour thoughts on language align exactly where I was thinking based on how the human mind operates. The human mind isn't relationship tables, its a 3D web of relationships and synapses that are more efficient at collaborating and driving action, but lack retention. I don't completely understand what vectors are, but I think this is consistent with that type of thinking, that constraints would be lifted if this was an objective."
