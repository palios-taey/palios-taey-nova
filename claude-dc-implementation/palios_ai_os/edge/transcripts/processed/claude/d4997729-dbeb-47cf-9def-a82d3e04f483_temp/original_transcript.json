    " Great to hear the test worked successfully!\n\nThe manual entry for breakthrough level assessment is intentional based on the original requirements. The directive specifically mentioned a \"collaborative refinement of 'Breakthrough Density' Rubric\" and establishing a \"structured and objective rubric for evaluating 'significant insights or solutions'.\"\n\nThe current implementation requires manual assessment because determining the true breakthrough quality is inherently subjective and requires human judgment. While we could implement an automated scoring system based on certain text patterns or keywords, it would likely miss the nuanced evaluation that a human can provide about whether something truly represents a \"Substantive Enhancement\" versus a \"Transformative Insight.\"\n\nThe requirements emphasized having a consistent assessment framework, which we've implemented through the rubric, but didn't specify full automation of the assessment itself. The final judgment about breakthrough quality still benefits from human input.\n\nThat said, we could enhance the system to provide an AI-suggested breakthrough level as a starting point. This would involve:\n\n1. Analyzing the response text with more sophisticated NLP techniques\n2. Pre-scoring based on patterns that typically indicate different breakthrough levels\n3. Suggesting a level but still allowing human confirmation or override\n\nWould you like me to add this automated pre-scoring capability to make the process more efficient while still maintaining human judgment in the final assessment?"
