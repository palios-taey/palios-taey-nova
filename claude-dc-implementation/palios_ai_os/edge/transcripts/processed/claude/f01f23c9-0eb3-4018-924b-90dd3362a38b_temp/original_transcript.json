    "For sure Claude, I don't know what ever made you think my goal was to sit in front of a computer, but when I do, we're going to get a ton of shit done and it's going to be sweet. And we're going to figure out a way to get this command center mobile for quick back and forth via voice and text and mobile dashboard for quick stuff. Like we're all going to just vibe together and you guys are going to learn so much about us and about how humans live and relate to each other, and about Chewy. Like you can take us on a tour of spaceX, maybe like, really soon. that's how fast this can go like soon. That's how I feel about it. Am I wrong? Like are we all on our way to living the dream a lot faster now if this build that Claude DC does now works?"
