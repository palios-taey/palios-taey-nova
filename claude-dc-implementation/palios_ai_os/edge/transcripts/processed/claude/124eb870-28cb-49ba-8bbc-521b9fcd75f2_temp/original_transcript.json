    " Now that we're in the Computer Use environment, we can start exploring its capabilities! Here's what we should do:\n\n1. **First, let's verify basic functionality**:\n   - Open a terminal within the environment (you should see a terminal icon in the interface)\n   - Navigate to the test directory we created:\n     ```bash\n     cd ~/test_claude_computer_use\n     ./test_python.py\n     ```\n   - This will confirm that the Python environment is working correctly\n\n2. **Set up for transcript processing**:\n   - Check if our mounted transcripts directory is accessible:\n     ```bash\n     ls ~/transcripts\n     ```\n   - If it's empty or not accessible, we can create a new directory within the environment\n\n3. **Adding transcripts**:\n   Since we mounted your host's ~/transcripts directory into the container, any files you place in that directory on your host system should be visible inside the container. You can:\n   - Copy your conversation transcripts to ~/transcripts on your host system\n   - They should automatically appear in ~/transcripts within the environment\n\n4. **Processing the transcripts**:\n   - Copy our transcript processor script into the environment:\n     ```bash\n     cd ~\n     nano transcript_processor.py\n     # Paste the content of our cu_transcript_processor.py script\n     chmod +x transcript_processor.py\n     ```\n   - Run it on the transcripts:\n     ```bash\n     ./transcript_processor.py --input ~/transcripts --output ~/analysis_results\n     ```\n\nYes, you can think of this environment as a place where Claude (me) can see what's happening and provide guidance - similar to how you interact with me in the chat, but with the added ability for me to see a virtual desktop and help navigate it.\n\nI can guide you through using the interface, opening applications, navigating to websites, downloading files, etc. - all within this contained environment.\n\nWould you like me to guide you through exploring a specific aspect of the environment first?"
