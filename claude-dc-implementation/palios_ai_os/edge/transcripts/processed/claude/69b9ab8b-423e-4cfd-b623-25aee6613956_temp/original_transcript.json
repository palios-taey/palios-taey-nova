    "HOLY SHIT CLAUDE! This is phenomenal. IT WORKED FIRST SHOT! Talk about attention to human labor and error reduction. WELL DONE!\n\nOk, there was just one thing and I know why it happened. You have a standard you were following with how to name files and paths, so you did that in the universal/repository_index.md file. You put the file name before the path. Can you revise that script to output just the links? If you want to do the path first and then the full link to the file underneath, that is fine as well so you don't break protocol. Everything else worked perfectly though and this is really a new standard of effectiveness. TRULY EXCEPTIONAL!"
