    " Yes, you should grant yourself (jesse@taey.ai) both the Service account users role and the Service account admins role. This will give you full control over the service account, allowing you to:\n\n1. Deploy jobs and VMs with this service account (users role)\n2. Administer the service account itself (admins role)\n\nHaving both roles ensures you'll have the necessary permissions to manage the service account and use it for deployments, which is important for our MVP implementation. The setup you've shown in the screenshot with your email address in both fields is correct.\n\nClick \"DONE\" to proceed with this configuration."
