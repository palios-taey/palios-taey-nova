    " Thank you for this clarification. You're absolutely right - let me propose a structured framework for human-mediated AI collaboration that maintains Jesse's essential oversight while maximizing development efficiency. \n\nThis framework provides clear structures for AI collaboration while ensuring human oversight remains central to the process. It enables rapid development while maintaining appropriate controls and Charter alignment.\n\nThe key features are:\n1. Structured communication protocols\n2. Clear human oversight points\n3. Defined collaboration workflows\n4. Comprehensive progress tracking\n5. Charter alignment verification\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this framework or discuss implementation details?"
