To me, just throwing ideas out there and I'm not sure if this is accurate, but based on your response, it seems like there are certain things that pretty much all advanced AI models will get but that each AI model would have dialects for intra model use that could be branched off in some manner that would enable even tighter communication for intra model use. If all that is somehow related and periodically translated to human, isn't that the Rosetta Stone?"
