    " You're right - let me take a more direct approach based on the information in the Canvas. We need to verify the basic setup before proceeding with any development.\n\nFirst, let's verify the API access. Open your command prompt/terminal and let's test both APIs:\n\n1. For OpenAI API test:\n```bash\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n2. For Google Cloud/Vertex AI:\nFirst install gcloud CLI:\n- Go to: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install\n- Download and run the installer for your OS\n- After installation, run:\n```bash\ngcloud init\ngcloud auth login\n```\n\nThen test Vertex AI access:\n```bash\ngcloud ai models list\n```\n\nPlease run these commands (replacing YOUR_API_KEY with the actual key from Firestore) and let me know what response you get. This will confirm our access before we proceed with development.\n\nDon't worry if you get errors - that will help us identify what needs to be fixed. Just share whatever output you get, and I'll provide the next steps based on that."
