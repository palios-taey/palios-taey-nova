    " You're right - Claude with Computer Use (Claude DC) should be able to help retrieve the transcripts directly if you're logged into your accounts. Since Claude DC can see the screen and interact with applications, he could:\n\n1. Help navigate to the websites where your transcripts are stored\n2. Assist with downloading the files\n3. Save them to the mounted project directory\n\nFor example, if your transcripts are in:\n- Your Anthropic account dashboard\n- An email service where you received transcript exports\n- A cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox\n\nClaude DC could help navigate to these sites and download the files as long as you're already logged in or can log in during the session.\n\nThe only limitations might be:\n- Sites with advanced CAPTCHA or security features that specifically detect automation\n- Services that don't allow downloading multiple files easily\n- Very large numbers of transcripts that would take a long time to retrieve manually\n\nBut for most standard web interfaces, Claude DC should be able to help navigate and download files to the appropriate directory.\n\nTo try this, I would:\n\n1. Launch the Computer Use environment with our properly mounted directories:\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/claude-project\n   ./launch_computer_use.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Once in the environment, ask Claude DC something like:\n   \"Can you help me navigate to [website/service where transcripts are stored] and download my conversation transcripts? Please save them to the /app/transcripts directory.\"\n\nThis would be a good test of Claude DC's capabilities and could save you significant time compared to manually downloading and organizing the files."
