    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking how to get the syntax right for his base directory, which is `~/projects/palios-taey-nova`. In the webhook server script, I need to update the `BASE_DIR` variable to point to this directory using the correct absolute path.\n\nSince `~` is a shell expansion that refers to the user's home directory, I need to make sure the path is specified correctly in the Python script, which doesn't automatically expand the tilde.\n</thinking>\n\nYou should replace the BASE_DIR line in the webhook_server.py file with the absolute path to your directory. Since you're using `~/projects/palios-taey-nova`, which contains a tilde (`~`), we need to convert this to a full path for Python. Here's how to update it:\n\n```python\n# Change this line in webhook_server.py\nBASE_DIR = \"/home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova\"  # Your project root directory\n```\n\nIf you're not sure of your home directory's absolute path, you can also use the expanduser function in Python:\n\n```python\n# Alternative approach using os.path.expanduser\nimport os\nBASE_DIR = os.path.expanduser(\"~/projects/palios-taey-nova\")\n```\n\nWhen editing the implementation script, you would change:\n\n```bash\n# In implement-webhook-server.sh, change this line\nBASE_DIR = \"/home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova\"  # Change this to your project root directory\n```\n\nThis ensures that the webhook server will correctly reference files in your project directory and handle path operations properly."
