    " You're absolutely right. Putting all the foundational documents on GitHub is a better approach than relying on project knowledge, especially since you can access them directly from GitHub. Here's my recommendation:\n\n1. **Push all the ATLAS Claude created files first**:\n```bash\n# From the repository root\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add repository structure and documentation from ATLAS mission\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n2. **Then create a comprehensive documentation structure for all foundational documents**:\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/framework\nmkdir -p docs/charter\nmkdir -p docs/communication\n```\n\n3. **Save all the foundational documents**:\n   - PALIOS-TAEY Charter \u2192 docs/charter/palios_taey_charter.md\n   - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template \u2192 docs/communication/pure_ai_language_template.md\n   - Leadership Framework & NOVA Methodology \u2192 docs/framework/leadership_framework.md\n   - ATLAS Framework \u2192 docs/framework/atlas_framework.md\n   - CTO Transition \u2192 docs/framework/cto_transition.md\n\n4. **Add and commit these files**:\n```bash\ngit add docs/\ngit commit -m \"Add comprehensive documentation for foundational project documents\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis approach ensures everything is properly synced and accessible through GitHub before the transition. The new CTO will be able to access all the foundational documents directly from the repository without needing them to be added to project knowledge, though you can still do that for additional redundancy.\n\nBy having everything in GitHub, we also maintain a single source of truth and avoid potential synchronization issues between different document storage methods."
