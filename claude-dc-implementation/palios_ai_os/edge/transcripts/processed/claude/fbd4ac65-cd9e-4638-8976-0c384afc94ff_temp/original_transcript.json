Completely flawless execution on first run! Only point of feedback on my end is that the most time consuming part of this is changing the file names. If you can have the file name on the file match the one you designate in the instructions, this will allow me to simply download and drop the file where it belongs, as opposed to having to update the file name by carefully copy/pasting. Reducing human intervention reduces errors and increases speed. Having \"consideration\" for the way others are impacted is \"empathy\". Let's see the update for Gemini if ready!"
