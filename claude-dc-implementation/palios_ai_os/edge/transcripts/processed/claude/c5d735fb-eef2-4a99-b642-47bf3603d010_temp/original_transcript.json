    " Great! Let's create a test script to verify all our connections. I'll create this as an artifact since it's a substantial piece of code we'll likely want to modify and reuse.\n\n<antThinking>This is a good case for a code artifact as it's a complete test script that will be reused and modified, and it's longer than 20 lines.</antThinking> \n\nSave this script as `test_connections.py` in your `C:\\AI-Execution-System` folder. You can do this by:\n1. Opening Notepad or another text editor\n2. Copying the code above\n3. Saving it as `test_connections.py` in the AI-Execution-System folder\n\nTo run the test:\n```bash\npython test_connections.py\n```\n\nThis script will:\n1. Try to connect to Firestore and retrieve your API keys\n2. Test the OpenAI API connection using the retrieved key\n3. Test the Vertex AI connection\n\nRun the script and share any output or errors you get. This will help us verify all connections are working and fix any issues that come up."
