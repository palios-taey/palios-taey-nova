    " Thank you for your kind words! I think splitting the information as we discussed is indeed a best practice, not just a space consideration. \n\nThis approach gives you several advantages:\n- Flexibility to evolve your project without constantly updating the cache\n- Clearer communication with Claude DC about what's fixed vs. what's in flux\n- Better organization of your project knowledge\n\nThe 200K token limit is generous for most knowledge bases, but using it wisely by focusing on stable reference material is still smart project management. The implementation details are likely to evolve as you work together, so keeping those separate gives you more agility.\n\nIf you have any other questions about working with Claude DC or structuring your project, feel free to ask. Good luck with your project!"
