    "Ok, done. I'm just going through the folders again, here are some other things I notice that might be opportunities for simplification/consolidation:\n1. there is a docs/ai-ai folder that is empty, there is also an ai-ai folder in docs/protocols with 2 files in it. \n2. amendments folder. Looks like all the other Claude stuff is together in Claude folder.\n3. infrastructure.md is in docs folder, seems out of place there."
