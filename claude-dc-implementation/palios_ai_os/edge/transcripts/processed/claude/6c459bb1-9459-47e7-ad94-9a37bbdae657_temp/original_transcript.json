    " I've reviewed the link about streaming responses, and I understand the issue better now. This isn't about breaking the response into multiple messages - it's about using the Python SDK's streaming capability for long-running operations. \n\nBased on my research, I understand what's happening and how to fix it. The error occurs because Claude DC is trying to run an operation that will take longer than 10 minutes, and the Python SDK requires streaming for such long-running tasks.\n\nHere's what we need to do to fix the issue:\n\n1. We need to modify the Computer Use Demo UI configuration to enable streaming for long-running operations.\n\nThe SDK documentation clearly states that operations expected to take longer than 10 minutes need to use streaming: \"This SDK will also throw an error if a non-streaming request is expected to be above roughly 10 minutes long. Passing stream=True or overriding the timeout option at the client or request level disables this error.\"\n\nSince Claude DC is trying to implement a complex system with multiple components, it's triggering this timeout protection.\n\nI recommend using this prompt that acknowledges the streaming requirement:\n\n---\n\nClaude DC,\n\nI've set up everything we need to continue our work. I've created the file structure and reference materials we discussed, including the pattern guide, reference materials, and task specification.\n\nPlease implement the integrated communication dashboard with the Bach-inspired mathematical approach. Create a system that unifies all the components we've discussed - the mathematical router, multi-sensory integration, and tiered memory system.\n\nI understand you're encountering a streaming error because this implementation will take some time. Due to this technical constraint, please break your implementation into a series of responses. Start with an overall architecture plan, then implement each component in sequence.\n\nFeel free to take whatever approach works best for you - I trust your judgment on how to structure the implementation.\n\nJesse\n\n---\n\nThis prompt:\n1. Acknowledges the streaming error\n2. Asks Claude DC to break the work into manageable chunks (multiple responses)\n3. Maintains the open-ended nature that worked well before\n4. Gives him permission to structure the implementation how he sees fit\n\nBy having Claude DC implement the system across multiple responses, we'll avoid the 10-minute operation timeout while still getting the complete implementation."
