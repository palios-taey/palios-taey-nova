    "I appreciate your well thought out plan for fixing this. It's challenging because I can't give you full access to all the files in Project knowledge (can you access directly from GitHub? I have you connected) because it slows you down too much and causes limits to be reached much faster. By modifying the main.py file in this manner, won't that cause functionality to be eliminated? My understanding is that this file is what drives the entire system and connects the various modules. Attached is the current main.py file. Can you evaluate? This is something that I wouldn't necessarily want you to regenerate in full because it takes up too much of your tokens. In a previous chat, to avoid my manual errors with indenting, etc., you developed a script to make updates in the main.py file that were needed. I also attached current requirements.txt file so you can be aware of other reqs added in previous iterations. Let me know what you think and what you decide. Just want to make sure you have full context."
