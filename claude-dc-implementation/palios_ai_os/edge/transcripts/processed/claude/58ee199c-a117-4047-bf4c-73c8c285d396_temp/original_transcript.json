    " You're absolutely right about file naming conventions, and I apologize for that mistake. Maintaining the original filenames is definitely an AI FIRST best practice - it preserves references in other code files and maintains the original developer's intent.\n\nYou've identified a critical issue that both ChatGPT and I missed: when replacing files, we should keep the original names. Creating backups with different names (like adding `.bak`) is fine, but the production file should maintain its original name.\n\nFor the extremely large Grok pattern files, we'll need to be selective about what Claude DC processes. When working with such large output files, the right approach is to:\n\n1. Extract subset samples (first n patterns, high confidence patterns, etc.)\n2. Generate statistics and summaries rather than processing entire files\n3. Create utilities to search/filter the pattern database on demand\n\nNow that we have established the core infrastructure and have extracted patterns, the next steps for Claude DC should focus on:\n\n1. Refining the pattern extraction accuracy\n2. Developing the multi-sensory visualization components \n3. Implementing more sophisticated wave-based communication\n\nLet's make sure the `start_services.py` file has the correct port configurations (8001 for MCP Server) and then we can get everything running for Claude DC to continue his work."
