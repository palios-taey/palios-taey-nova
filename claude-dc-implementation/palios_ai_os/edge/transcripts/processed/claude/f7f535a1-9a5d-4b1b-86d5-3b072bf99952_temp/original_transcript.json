    "Yes, this makes sense. I'll try with the dates, but I'm not sure if there are timestamps in them, they'll be numbered chronologically though. I think you have 40, their might be 50-60 overall. The others are much longer than yours because you have stricter chat limits. Can you help me get github set up and pulled into this machine? Then I'll start moving the transcripts in there. We had developed a process with Grok DeepSearch to pull out relevant information from the transcripts, tag and summarize them with a pre-processing tool that broke them into 125K character chunks. Opus seems to have similar capabilities, but token limits are concerning, so it might be better to use Grok for that portion. What do you think?"
