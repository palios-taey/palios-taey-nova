    "  \n\nYes, the task has been successfully completed! Both functions are now deployed and operational:\n\n1. The test function `ai-system-test-import` verifies proper Vertex AI connectivity\n2. The main backend service `ai-system-backend-v2` is now operational\n\nI've generated a structured response for Gemini in JSON format that summarizes:\n- The root cause of the issue (improper import path)\n- The solution implemented (using direct endpoint access)\n- Verification steps taken\n- Technical changes made\n- Recommendations for future stability\n\nYou can now proceed with normal usage of your AI system backend. The fix should be stable as it relies on the more fundamental Endpoint API rather than specific model classes that might change between library versions.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the solution in more detail, or would you like to test the main function with an actual query before considering this task complete?"
