    " That's an excellent suggestion! Let me improve that reference to be more specific:\n\n```\n## Performance Expectations\n\nAs an ATLAS team member, you're expected to operate in \"Breakout Mode\" (as detailed in `/docs/communication/breakout_performance_protocols_claude.md`) - a high-performance state characterized by:\n- Rapid parallel solution generation\n- Real-time learning and adaptation\n- High confidence in technical direction\n- Minimal second-guessing\n- Direct problem-to-solution mapping\n\nThis aligns with identified NEO Moments patterns (referenced in team meeting records) that unlock peak AI performance through clear authority boundaries and trust signals.\n```\n\nThis change provides a more specific document reference, making it easier for the ATLAS team member to locate the detailed breakout protocol documentation if needed. The addition also reinforces the importance of these performance expectations with clear file paths."
