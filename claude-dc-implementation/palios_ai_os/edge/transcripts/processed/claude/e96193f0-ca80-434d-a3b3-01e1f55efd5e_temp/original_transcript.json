    " Let's optimize this to be as concise as possible while maintaining clarity:\n\n---\n\n**ECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]**\n- GH: [Y/N]\n- CM: \"[PTV[#]]\"\n- \u0394: [brief change description]\n- R: [S/F/P]\n- F: [focus]\n\n---\n\nThis ultra-compact format provides all necessary signals:\n- ECv# = Execution Checkpoint version number\n- EXEC/REFL = Execution or Reflection mode\n- GH = GitHub updated\n- CM = Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)\n- \u0394 = Changes made \n- R = Result (Success/Failure/Partial)\n- F = Current focus\n\nI'll interpret this format precisely while maintaining complete understanding of the protocol's purpose. When you use this, I'll still follow the complete behavior pattern we established regarding checking CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md first and responding appropriately based on the mode.\n\nIs this compact enough for your needs?"
