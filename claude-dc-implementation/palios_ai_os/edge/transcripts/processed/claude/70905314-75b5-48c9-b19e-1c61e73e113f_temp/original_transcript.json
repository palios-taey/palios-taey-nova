    " No, you don't need to delete the triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) at the top of the files. Those are Python docstrings that describe what each module does. They're an important part of the code that provides documentation and context for anyone reading the files.\n\nRegarding testing, I wasn't able to directly test the code execution in this environment. However, the code is based on standard patterns and best practices that should work correctly. The key components like the Flask application, Firestore integration, and API communication are built on well-established libraries.\n\nAfter downloading the files, I recommend:\n\n1. First run the test script locally (`python test_system.py`) to verify basic functionality\n2. Test one component at a time (main API, transcript processing, etc.)\n3. Check logs carefully for any errors\n\nIf you encounter any specific issues during testing, please let me know, and I can help troubleshoot them. The most likely points that might need adjustment are:\n- API authentication details\n- Firestore connection configuration\n- Path references if your directory structure differs\n\nLet me know when you have the files downloaded and if you need any help with the next steps!"
