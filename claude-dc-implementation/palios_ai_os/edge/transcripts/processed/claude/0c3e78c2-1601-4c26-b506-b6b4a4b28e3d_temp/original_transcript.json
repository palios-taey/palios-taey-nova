    " Ah, I see the issue. We need to add the build script to package.json. Let me help you fix that.\n\n1. Update your package.json to include the build script. Add or modify the \"scripts\" section:\n\n```bash\nnpm pkg set scripts.build=\"tsc\"\n```\n\nOr manually edit package.json to include:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"paliostypescript\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",\n    \"build\": \"tsc\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"^11.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^22.13.5\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.3.3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter making this change, try running:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nIf you get any typescript errors after this, please share them with me and I'll help resolve them. Also, since I noticed typescript wasn't in your devDependencies earlier, you might need to:\n\n```bash\nnpm install typescript --save-dev\n```\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any of these steps or would you prefer different instructions?"
