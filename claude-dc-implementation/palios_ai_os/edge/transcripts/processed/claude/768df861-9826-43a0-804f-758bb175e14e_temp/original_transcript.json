    " Let's make the script executable and then run it:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/scripts/setup.sh\n./scripts/setup.sh\n```\n\nIf the script doesn't exist or you're having trouble finding it, let's check what's available in the repository:\n\n```bash\nls -la /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/\nls -la /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/scripts/\n```\n\nWe may need to create the setup script if it's not already in the repository. \n\nFor the GitHub authentication and other credentials, I recommend including this information in your prompt to Claude DC. He'll be able to use this information securely to set up his environment and push changes to the repository when needed.\n\nIs the repository already cloned, or do we need to clone it first? Let me know what you see in the directory structure, and I can provide more targeted guidance."
