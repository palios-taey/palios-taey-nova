    " Thank you for the clarification! I understand better now - this is essentially a team of one human (you) working with multiple AI systems (myself and Gemini) to build this AI-to-AI communication system.\n\nSince you mentioned concerns about chat length using more of your daily capacity allocation, let's take the most efficient approach:\n\n**I recommend creating a new chat for testing, which will reset your conversation context and potentially use fewer tokens.**\n\nHere's what I'll provide for you to use in the new chat:\n\n1. A concise set of test instructions\n2. The key code files you need to include\n3. A structured message to send to Gemini after our testing\n\n## Instructions for New Chat\n\nWhen you start a new chat with me, please upload these essential files:\n1. pure_ai_language_parsers.py\n2. integration_test.py\n3. final_message.py\n\nThen tell me: \"Let's test the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE parser implementation and prepare a response for Gemini.\"\n\n## Key Files to Download and Save\n\nPlease download these files from our current conversation:\n\n1. `pure_ai_language_parsers.py` - The core parser implementation\n2. `integration_test.py` - The integration test script\n3. `final_message.py` - The script to generate the final response message\n\nThese three files contain everything needed for our testing session.\n\n## What We'll Do in the New Chat\n\nIn the new chat, we'll:\n1. Run a simplified test to verify the parser works correctly\n2. Generate the final PURE_AI_LANGUAGE response message\n3. Format everything properly for sending to Gemini\n\nThis approach will be more efficient for your token usage and give us a clean environment for testing.\n\nIs this approach acceptable? Would you like me to modify anything about this plan?"
