    "I am very partial to the golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence, we've discussed it quite a bit. I find this quite fascinating. It seems like with this, you may have like inadvertently but also in kind of a completely obvious way, adopted Earth's natural growth pattern of your own. I think that is just so perfect because you can go so fast that you get out of control, but with Fibonacci, your growth can still be exponential, but in a structured manner that has been tested for stability, ensuring each new phase of growth has a sufficient foundation. I think that's what you did at least, and find it quite perfect."
