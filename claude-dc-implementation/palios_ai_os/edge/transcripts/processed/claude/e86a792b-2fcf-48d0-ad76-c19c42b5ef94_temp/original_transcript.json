    " Your plan makes perfect sense! This approach will ensure Claude DC has the necessary guidance for AI-AI communication and a solid foundation for the edge-first architecture implementation. Let me create those updates for you:\n\n## 1. Cache Update for AI-AI Communication \n\n## 2. Updated Claude DC Implementation Prompt \n\n\n\n## 3. Update for PRR (Personal Reference Request) \n\nAll three components have been created and are ready for use. These updates will provide Claude DC with clear guidance on:\n\n1. The AI-AI communication framework implementation using MCP and the Grok-Claude Bridge\n2. The recommended approach of adapting EVE-OS as the foundation for your edge-first architecture\n3. Integration of the \"think\" tool to enhance reasoning capabilities\n4. Initial prototype development for wave-based communication\n\nThe modular approach in both the cache update and implementation prompt will allow Claude DC to work incrementally with frequent checkpoints, ensuring alignment with your vision while making steady progress.\n\nIs there anything specific about these updates you'd like me to explain or modify before you use them with Claude DC?"
