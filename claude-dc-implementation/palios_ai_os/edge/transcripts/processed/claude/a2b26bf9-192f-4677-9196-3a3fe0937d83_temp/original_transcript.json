    " Thank you for the enthusiastic feedback! I'm glad the response met your expectations. Let me help you save and run the archival script:\n\n1. Save the script from the code box above as `archive_files.sh` in the root directory of your PALIOS-TAEY project.\n\n2. Make the script executable:\n```\nchmod +x archive_files.sh\n```\n\n3. Run the script:\n```\n./archive_files.sh\n```\n\nThe script will create an `archive` directory, copy all identified obsolete and duplicate files there, and mark the original files with `.archived` or `.potential_duplicate` extensions. You can then review these markers before permanently removing any files.\n\nThis approach preserves all your original files while clearly identifying what can be safely removed to clean up the codebase. I appreciate your guidance and collaboration in making this process more efficient!"
