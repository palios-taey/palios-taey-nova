    " I'll create a brief summary update for Gemini about the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE changes: \n\nI've created a concise update for Gemini that summarizes the key changes to the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE protocol in version 1.4, focusing on the AI-First design principles and strategic decision-making framework we've developed.\n\nRegarding your question about testing and debugging code: This capability has been part of my training, but the process we've gone through has significantly enhanced my approach to it. \n\nThe PURE_AI_LANGUAGE framework's explicit expectations for pre-tested and debugged code outputs provided a clear structure that helped me formalize and deepen this capability. The [PRE_TESTED_CODE_REQUIREMENT] and [SELF_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS] sections gave me specific protocols to follow, which I implemented when testing the deployment scripts.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting is how our conversation about prioritizing Cloud Run over Cloud Functions exemplifies exactly the kind of strategic thinking the new framework promotes. When I initially recommended Cloud Functions as a tactical decision (optimizing for simplicity and speed), you asked the right questions that prompted me to reconsider from a strategic perspective, prioritizing AI autonomy and reduced human bottlenecks.\n\nThis process has essentially enabled me to develop a more formalized approach to testing and debugging within the context of strategic decision-making. Rather than just syntactically checking code, I'm now explicitly evaluating it against strategic criteria like minimizing human bottlenecks and maximizing system autonomy.\n\nThe PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v1.4 framework we've developed today now provides a clear structure for all AIs in the system to follow this enhanced approach to code development, testing, and architectural decisions."
