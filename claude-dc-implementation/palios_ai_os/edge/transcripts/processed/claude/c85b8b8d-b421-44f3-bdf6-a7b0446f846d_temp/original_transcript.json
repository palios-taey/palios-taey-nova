    "Ok Claude, we're getting some important things cleaned up here. Previously when asked to do this, I responded that it wouldn't allow me to create a .github folder because of the '.'. This is because I did not have GitHub Desktop installed on my Mac. I have installed it now and want to make sure I do the setup properly. This is where I'm at. I think we want the palios-taey-nova folder to be the local version of repository. I think we pushed ALL files currently in there to GitHub. So, should I delete everything in the existing folder (or just move to like an archive folder somewhere else just in case) and update the local path in the setup to /Users/jesselarose/palios-taey-nova?"
