    " Here's a git commit message that would make sense for this code cleanup task:\n\n```\ngit commit -m \"Clean up codebase with archival script\n\n- Created file archival system for obsolete and duplicate files\n- Identified 7 backup files to archive\n- Flagged 5 redundant deployment scripts\n- Preserved original files with clear markers\n- Prepared repository for full MVP implementation\"\n```\n\nThis commit message clearly explains what the script does, what we identified, and why we're doing this cleanup (to prepare for the full MVP implementation)."
