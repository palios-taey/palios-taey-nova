    " You're right - I didn't mean to imply you were mad at me, and I apologize if my response came across that way. I also see that I mistakenly identified those as your GCP credentials in the screenshot when it was just showing terminal output from the script.\n\nHere's what I recommend as the simplest path forward:\n\n1. **Restart Claude DC without any modifications** to his code - this gives us a clean slate\n2. **Start with the cache review approach** as you suggested - this is the standard process that's worked before\n3. **Use shorter, incremental prompts** rather than trying to fit everything into one message\n\nYour initial prompt could be something like:\n\n```\nClaude DC,\n\nI've set up your environment with the basic structure. Your cache files are available in the /home/computeruse/cache/ directory. Please review them in this order to restore your context:\n\n1. claude-dc-cache_part-1.md\n2. claude-dc-cache_part-2.md\n3. cache-update.md\n4. webhook-integration-instructions.md\n5. CACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION.md\n\nLet me know when you've reviewed these files and are ready for the implementation directive.\n\nJesse\n```\n\nOnce he confirms he's reviewed the cache, you can then provide the implementation directive in smaller chunks, starting with the overall architecture, then diving into specific components.\n\nThis approach:\n1. Uses the standard cache review process that's worked before\n2. Avoids hitting token/timeout limits\n3. Doesn't require any code modifications\n\nThis should get Claude DC up and running with minimal complications."
