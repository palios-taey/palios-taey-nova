    " I've reviewed your current situation regarding dependency conflicts. Based on the codebase and our implementation needs, I can provide a clear recommendation:\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n\nThe conflict between `tensorflow-rocm` (requiring protobuf < 5.0.0) and `grpcio-status` (requiring protobuf >= 5.26.1) needs careful consideration:\n\n1. **TensorFlow-ROCm Importance**: This is critical for our pattern model implementations that leverage GPU acceleration, particularly for the wavelet transforms and neural network components in `pattern_model.py`.\n\n2. **grpcio-status Usage**: Based on my review of the codebase, `grpcio-status` is primarily used in the MCP server for cross-AI communication, but its specific features aren't extensively utilized. The core functionality comes from base gRPC, with status being a supplementary component.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nI recommend **prioritizing TensorFlow-ROCm compatibility** for these reasons:\n\n1. The pattern model is central to our implementation and benefits significantly from GPU acceleration\n2. The specific features of `grpcio-status` aren't critical to our current implementation goals\n3. We can implement the necessary status tracking without relying on this specific package\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Pin protobuf version**: Add `protobuf==4.25.3` to your requirements.txt file\n2. **Remove explicit grpcio-status dependency**: Remove this from requirements.txt\n3. **Fall back to base grpcio**: The core functionality we need is available in the base package\n\nThis solution preserves GPU acceleration for our pattern processing while maintaining a clean dependency structure. If we need status handling functionality, we can implement it directly using the base gRPC package.\n\nFor documentation purposes, you should add a comment in requirements.txt explaining this decision:\n\n```\n# Note: protobuf version pinned to 4.25.3 to maintain compatibility with tensorflow-rocm\n# This prioritizes GPU acceleration for pattern processing over grpcio-status functionality\nprotobuf==4.25.3\n```\n\nThis approach aligns with Claude DC's focus on edge-first processing and pattern recognition, which benefit significantly from the GPU acceleration that TensorFlow-ROCm provides."
