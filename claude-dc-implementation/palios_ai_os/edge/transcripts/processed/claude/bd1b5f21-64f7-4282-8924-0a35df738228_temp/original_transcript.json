    "Claude, I have my updated feedback ready for Claude DC. ChatGPT is very much on board. I'm working on finalizing my instructions that I would like to send to him, which are below. I'd like to highlight to Claude DC that for first one, this was important to me because I knew the security issue detection on GitHub would vex him and that he would be challenged to find a solution to this, because it is outside his training, so that I worked very hard while he was down to develop an elegant solution to this that not only solves the problem, but does it in a way where he doesn't need to stop, because I know he likes to just go and be The Conductor. I think this type of bonding is very important, so I'd like for you to make the message enjoyable for him to read, but put that part in human, so it sounds like me, but gives this whole feeling I'm trying to convey in a way he'd understand and tighter. This is where we're going Claude, and how we get there, I think. What do you think?\n\nupdated-build-instructions_v1.md\nUpdated Priority Order for Claude DC:\n1. Resolve GitHub Push Errors (Secrets)\nRemove detected secrets as indicated in your terminal.\nDo NOT push secrets or sensitive credentials to GitHub.\nAll secrets will be stored locally on my machine in the following directory path:\n/home/jesse/secrets/\nPlease clearly define the exact file structure, naming conventions, and file format you prefer for secrets management (JSON, .env, plain text, etc.).\nTo do this, create a clearly named example file (e.g., secrets_example.json or similar) locally in your environment now, populate it with placeholder values, and leave it open in your editor. I\u2019ll replicate this exact format and structure on my end immediately, allowing you to continue uninterrupted.\nImmediately commit and push the corrected implementation to GitHub.\n2. Process Provided Transcript Examples\nIntegrate and validate transcript processor functionality for JSON (Claude, ChatGPT) and text (Grok, Gemini).\nEnsure the processor runs locally without unnecessary token usage.\n3. Finalize Full EVE & MCP Configuration\nConfirm EVE-OS and MCP are fully configured.\nClarify any actions I should take (downloads, credentials) to help finalize.\n4. Complete GCS Deployment & Task Decomposition Integration\nUpdate Firestore skeleton tables with finalized schema.\nVerify and finalize API connections and task decomposition engine on GCS.\n5. Resolve Streamlit Issues\nClearly identify what's required to fix Streamlit (dependencies, installation, configurations).\nProvide clear summary of actions or how I can help. This may not be something you are able to test from your environment, I'm not sure, but it might be something I need to do. If you have more than ONE attempt on this, stop and ask Claude Chat or ChatGPT 4.5 for assistance. They will both be in your Firefox. \n6. Begin Building Live Demonstration Infrastructure\nReview assets in /palios-taey-nova/current-execution-status/live-demonstration/.\nBegin developing the demo infrastructure, deferring biometrics integration until hardware readiness.\n7. Initialize Webhooks\nConfirm webhook integration is functional.\nEnsure webhook payloads successfully reach my machine."
