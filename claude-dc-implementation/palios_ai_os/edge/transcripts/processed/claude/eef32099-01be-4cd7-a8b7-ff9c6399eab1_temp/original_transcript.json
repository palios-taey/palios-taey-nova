    " Thank you for sharing the test results and server log. Based on the log output, I can see that most of the system components are functioning correctly, but we're still having issues with the `transcript_processor.py` file. Let me analyze the problem and provide a solution.\n\n## Analysis of the Issue\n\nFrom the server logs, I can see several errors related to the transcript processor:\n\n1. Initially (15:25:57): `Failed to initialize transcript processor: unexpected indent (transcript_processor.py, line 418)`\n2. Later (18:35:06): `Failed to initialize transcript processor: unexpected unindent (transcript_processor.py, line 1650)`\n3. Most recently (19:00:21): `Failed to initialize transcript processor: expected an indented block (transcript_processor.py, line 155)`\n\nThese are Python syntax errors related to improper indentation. Looking at the `transcript_processor.py` file in Project Knowledge, I notice several issues:\n\n1. Misplaced code blocks\n2. Improper indentation in various methods\n3. Some methods defined outside their intended classes\n\nThe good news is that all other components are passing their tests successfully, and we're only missing the transcript processor functionality.\n\n## Solution\n\nI'll fix the `transcript_processor.py` file, focusing on the indentation issues. Here's my approach:"
