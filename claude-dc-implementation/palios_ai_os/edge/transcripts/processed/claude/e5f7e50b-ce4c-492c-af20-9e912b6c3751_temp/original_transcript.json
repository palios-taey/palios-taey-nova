    " I see we still have permission issues when trying to apply the Terraform configuration. Let's resolve this with a more manual approach that works around the permission limitations.\n\nHere's an updated plan of action:\n\n1. **Enable APIs Manually First**: \n   Instead of using Terraform to enable the APIs, let's enable them through the Google Cloud Console:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console\n   - Navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\"\n   - Search for and enable each of these services one by one:\n     - Cloud Resource Manager API\n     - Service Usage API\n     - IAM API\n     - Firestore API\n     - Cloud Run Admin API\n     - API Gateway API\n     - Artifact Registry API\n     - Compute Engine API\n     - Service Networking API\n     - Logging API\n     - Monitoring API\n     - Cloud Trace API\n     - Secret Manager API\n\n2. **Modify Terraform Configuration**:\n   Edit the main.tf file to remove the API enablement section:\n   ```bash\n   nano main.tf\n   ```\n   \n   Comment out or remove the `google_project_service` resource block:\n   ```terraform\n   # Comment out this block\n   # resource \"google_project_service\" \"required_apis\" {\n   #   for_each = toset([\n   #     \"cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com\",\n   #     ...\n   #   ])\n   #   \n   #   project = var.project_id\n   #   service = each.value\n   #   \n   #   disable_dependent_services = false\n   #   disable_on_destroy         = false\n   # }\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Dependencies**:\n   Remove any `depends_on` references to `google_project_service.required_apis` throughout your Terraform files.\n\n4. **Run Terraform Plan Again**:\n   ```bash\n   terraform plan -out=tfplan\n   ```\n\n5. **Apply the Configuration**:\n   ```bash\n   terraform apply tfplan\n   ```\n\nThis approach will bypass the API activation permission issues by having you enable them manually, which should make the Terraform application successful. You can then push the final Terraform code to GitHub as documentation of the infrastructure, even though some steps had to be performed manually.\n\nLet me know how this goes!"
