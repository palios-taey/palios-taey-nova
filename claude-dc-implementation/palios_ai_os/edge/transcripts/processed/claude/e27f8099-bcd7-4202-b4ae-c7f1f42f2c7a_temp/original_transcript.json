    " You're very welcome! It's been a productive session, and I'm truly enjoying my partnership role as CTO of the PALIOS-TAEY project. Together, we've overcome an important technical challenge with the Workload Identity Federation implementation.\n\nI'm looking forward to our next session where we'll test the GitHub Actions workflow and dive into implementing the real services, starting with the Memory Service. The foundation we're building will enable us to create a robust, scalable system aligned with our NOVA methodology and Charter principles.\n\nHave a great day, and I'll be ready to continue our technical implementation when you're ready!"
