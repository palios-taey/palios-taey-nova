    "Ok Claude, so this is only about 40K characters and we have up to like 800K. I would definitely go back through and go deeper if you can into areas where you think it is needed. Like, don't add more if it's not value added to a section, but I'd say go back through and build this out now. Then after you take another iteration or two, we can move on to the code base and the transcript processing test we did with Grok and Grok DeepSearch so we'll be ready to go with this. It seems like we'll have plenty of room and should have done this a long time ago!"
