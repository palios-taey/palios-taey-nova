    " I understand the bucket has uniform bucket-level access enabled, which prevents us from directly viewing the ACL. Let's simplify our approach:\n\n1. **Create a completely new TF configuration without any backend**:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ../terraform-minimal\ncd ../terraform-minimal\n\ncat > main.tf <<EOF\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    google = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/google\"\n      version = \"~> 4.80.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nprovider \"google\" {\n  project = \"palios-taey-dev\"\n  region  = \"us-central1\"\n}\n\n# Test resource - a simple storage bucket\nresource \"google_storage_bucket\" \"test_bucket\" {\n  name          = \"palios-taey-test-bucket-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}\"\n  location      = \"US\"\n  force_destroy = true\n}\n\nresource \"random_id\" \"bucket_suffix\" {\n  byte_length = 4\n}\nEOF\n\nterraform init\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\nterraform apply tfplan\n```\n\n2. **If this works, gradually add our real infrastructure components**:\n\nOnce we verify that basic Terraform operations work, we can gradually add the resources we need from our original configuration.\n\nThis minimal approach will help us identify if there are specific resources or configurations causing issues. It will also let us make progress by implementing at least some of the infrastructure instead of being completely blocked.\n\nLet's start with this approach and see if we can get at least basic Terraform operations working."
