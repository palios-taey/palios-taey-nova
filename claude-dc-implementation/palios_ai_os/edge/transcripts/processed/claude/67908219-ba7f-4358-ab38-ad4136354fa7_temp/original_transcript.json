    " You're absolutely right about the AI-first approach, and I appreciate your recognition of my delegated authority in this infrastructure setup! Following your screenshot, I can see we need to set up proper Google Cloud organization first.\n\nFor a clean, professional infrastructure setup, I recommend creating an organization which will give us better governance, resource management, and security controls. Here's how we should proceed:\n\n## Setting up a Google Cloud Organization\n\n1. **Create a Google Workspace Account**:\n   - Go to [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)\n   - Sign up for a business account (you'll need a domain name)\n   - Complete the basic setup process\n\n2. **Enable Cloud Identity and Organization**:\n   - Once your Google Workspace is activated, log into the Google Cloud Console\n   - The system will automatically create an organization for your domain\n   - You'll become the Organization Administrator by default\n\n3. **Modified Project Approach**:\n   - After organization setup, we'll modify our approach slightly to create projects under this organization\n   - This provides better governance, billing management, and security boundaries\n\n## Adapted Infrastructure Setup\n\nOnce your organization is set up:\n\n1. **Run the unmodified script with your new organization ID**:\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project true --org-id YOUR_NEW_ORG_ID --billing-account 012796-3C9A41-E282F5 --environment dev\n```\n\nThis approach follows Google's best practices for enterprise-grade infrastructure, which aligns perfectly with the PALIOS-TAEY system's requirements for security, scalability, and proper governance.\n\nWould you like to proceed with setting up the Google Workspace and organization first? I can also provide more specific guidance for the organization creation process if needed."
