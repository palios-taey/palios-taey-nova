    " I'm sorry to hear about your System76 machine freezing. This kind of situation is frustrating when you're in the middle of important work.\n\nTo retain your session with Claude DC on the System76 machine, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Remote Access**: If you have SSH or another remote access method set up, you could potentially connect to the System76 machine from your MacBook to continue the session.\n\n2. **Hard Reboot and Session Recovery**: If you have to force restart the System76 machine, the Claude DC environment might still be preserved if it was running in a Docker container or a virtual environment that automatically restarts.\n\n3. **Backup Implementation Files**: If you can get the machine running again, immediately backup all the implementation files that Claude DC has created so far. These would typically be in the `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation` directory.\n\nThe good news is that Claude DC's changes should be saved on the filesystem even if the machine froze, so you likely haven't lost any work. Once the System76 machine is operational again, you can simply restart the Claude DC session and he should be able to continue where he left off, especially if you give him context about what was happening.\n\nIf you're unable to recover the session directly, you could also reconstruct it by providing Claude DC with the same files and instructions on your MacBook, though this would require setting up a similar environment there.\n\nWould you like specific instructions for any of these recovery approaches?"
