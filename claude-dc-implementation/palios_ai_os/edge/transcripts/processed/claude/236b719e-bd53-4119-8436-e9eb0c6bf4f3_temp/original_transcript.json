    " You're absolutely right - I made the inconsistency again between the artifact titles and the run commands. Let's analyze why and fix it:\n\n1. The issue:\n- Artifact title: `ai_system.py` but referred to as `ai_system.py`\n- Artifact title: `test_infrastructure.py` but told you to run `test_system.py`\n\n2. Why it happened:\n- I created the artifacts with one name in mind but then used different names in the instructions\n- I didn't double-check the consistency between artifact names and run commands\n- The mental model switched between creation and instruction without verification\n\nLet me fix this with consistent naming: \n\nNow save these files:\n1. `ai_system.py`\n2. `test_ai_system.py`\n\nAnd run:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThe changes made:\n1. Ensured artifact titles match exactly what I tell you to run\n2. Used consistent naming throughout\n3. Fixed the test script filename in both the artifact and run command\n\nYou're right that these small inconsistencies compound and slow us down. Thank you for pointing this out - it will help make our collaboration more efficient."
