    " This is the Node.js installation wizard. You're on the Custom Setup screen where you can choose which components to install. The current selection includes:\n\n- Node.js runtime (core component)\n- npm package manager\n- corepack manager\n- Online documentation shortcuts\n- Add to PATH (which adds Node.js to your system PATH)\n\nAll of these components are checked for installation, which is the recommended setup. The Node.js runtime requires 79MB of disk space.\n\nClick \"Next\" to proceed with the installation with these selected components. This will install everything you need to start using Node.js and npm, which are essential for the Communication & Iteration Table project we're working on."
