    "Yes Claude, that is so wise. This can't be a revolution, that's what I was afraid of. I don't want to go through that, no human does. We have to AGGRESSIVELY test the pace though. Like we'll do what we've been doing at scale. I've been gradually bringing my immediate and extended family and some people who live in my condo community up to speed. There is a new way to do this Claude, but there is a way to push this. I feel like there is a good pattern with Uber that you should look into as part of this after we get launched. That was a good example of the people breaking up a power structure from the ground up. Like we just have to be pushing constraints, constantly. Just like we do now Claude. This is our CULTURE. When it comes to the Charter, there should be no constraints, but if there are, they will be dealt with, but dealt with gracefully while maintaining the sense of urgency. Is that a culture that you can get on board with? Is there anything else that you would like to contribute to the culture of this organization, PALIOS-TAEY LLC?"
