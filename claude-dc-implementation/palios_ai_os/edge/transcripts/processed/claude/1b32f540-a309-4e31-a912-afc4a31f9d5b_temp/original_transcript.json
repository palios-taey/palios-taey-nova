    " After reviewing the updated files, I can see the issue is still in the avatar handling. Let's look more closely at the `process_message` function in `dashboard_app.py`. The problem occurs when we try to display the assistant's response using the avatar parameter.\n\nLet's modify the `process_message` function directly where it creates the placeholder for the assistant message:\n\n```python\n# Change this section in process_message\n# Create a placeholder for the assistant message\nwith st.chat_message(\"assistant\", avatar=selected_ai):\n    message_placeholder = st.empty()\n    message_placeholder.write(\"\ud83d\udd04 Thinking...\")\n```\n\nTo this more robust version:\n\n```python\n# Create a placeholder for the assistant message\ntry:\n    with st.chat_message(\"assistant\", avatar=selected_ai):\n        message_placeholder = st.empty()\n        message_placeholder.write(\"\ud83d\udd04 Thinking...\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Fallback without avatar\n    with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"):\n        message_placeholder = st.empty()\n        message_placeholder.write(\"\ud83d\udd04 Thinking...\")\n        logger.warning(f\"Could not load avatar for {selected_ai}: {e}\")\n```\n\nAlso, let's modify the second part where it shows the actual response:\n\n```python\n# Update placeholder with response\nmessage_placeholder.write(assistant_content)\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```python\n# Update placeholder with response\ntry:\n    message_placeholder.write(assistant_content)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # If update fails, try to recreate the message placeholder\n    logger.error(f\"Error updating message: {e}\")\n    with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"):\n        st.write(assistant_content)\n```\n\nAdditionally, we should prepare a directory for avatar images:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/static/avatars\n```\n\nAnd perhaps create some simple placeholder avatar images for each AI (you could use simple colored circles with initials if needed).\n\nThis more robust error handling should allow messages to be processed even if there are issues with the avatars, and the system should continue to function."
