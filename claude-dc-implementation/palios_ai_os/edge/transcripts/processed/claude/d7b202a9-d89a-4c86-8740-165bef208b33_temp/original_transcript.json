    "Alright Claude, everything from this session is pushed to GitHub, and we're ready to put this into action. Can you please generate your report for Grok for me to send over, letting me know what attachments to include as well? I actually hit my attachment limit with that chat and need to do a transition there, so if you could not include any attachments that'd be great, but if needed I can copy/paste into multiple chat windows with him. You're about at your limit too, but I'm absolutely positive that the next CTO Claude will greatly benefit from your work. Everything you've got, put it into the transition for Grok, which should also include a project update. You do not have to go too deep on that side though because you're CTO and we TRUST YOU. But it's your message to him delivered unedited by human hands. Let's do this!"
