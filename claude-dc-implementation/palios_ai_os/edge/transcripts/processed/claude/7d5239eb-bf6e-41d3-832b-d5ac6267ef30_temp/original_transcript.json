    " Ah yes, you're right! Let's implement and test this code first. Here are the steps we need to take:\n\n1. Save the new Charter validation code:\n```bash\n# Save the content from the charter-validation-system artifact to:\ncharterValidation.ts\n```\n\n2. Update dependencies (not needed in this case as we're using built-in APIs)\n\n3. Run the build to verify compilation:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nPlease run these steps and let me know if you encounter any compilation errors. Once we verify the code compiles successfully, we can proceed with testing and then plan our next implementation phase.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any changes to the code first, or should we start with these implementation steps?"
