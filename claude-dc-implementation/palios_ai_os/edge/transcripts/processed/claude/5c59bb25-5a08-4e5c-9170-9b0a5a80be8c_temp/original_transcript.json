    "Perfect! That worked. My cache is only 171K characters, comfortably within Claude Computer Use's (Claude DC's) 200K limit. Claude, I've been really struggling with this and I need your help. I have a very important project I'm working on with you in another chat that I need to get this cache into Claude DC for. I've tried several times following Claude DC's instructions and yours, but the cache isn't sticking and he is just BURNING through tokens and I keep getting limited after trying and then I'm stuck where I started with no cache. I really need your help with this Claude. How can I get the cache loaded into Claude DC correctly through his terminal window?"
