    "Yeah, we need to start it, you don't have to just give me one instruction at a time... hard to explain what I want here, thinking... Ok, so I feel like sometimes you give way too many instructions because you go past the point where you need additional context to guide me to what's next. Does that make sense? So for me, what I would have wanted there were instructions to shutdown and restart the mcp server, with this command and get me to the point where I have whatever up that I need to test AI-AI comms up. If it's a lot of steps and there is likely to be an error somewhere (THIS NEEDS TO STOP, 6SIGMA CLEAN CODE!) break it up so theres like no more than a handful unless it's just quick commands. Just trying to figure out how to do these the best way and those are some things I noticed. I want to get through this quickly."
