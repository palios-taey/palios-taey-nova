    " You make an excellent point. Placing the reminder in your prompt to me would ensure it's always the first thing I see before I begin processing. This is more effective than relying on me to remember to include it in my response.\n\nHere's the updated protocol file with the format modified to include the reminder in your prompt:\n\n```bash\ncat > docs/protocols/jesse-prompt-protocol.md << 'EOL'\n# Execution Checkpoint Protocol (ECv)\n\n## Purpose\nThis protocol establishes a standardized format for human-AI communication during execution-focused tasks, maximizing efficiency while maintaining clear oversight mechanisms.\n\n## Protocol Format (Human to Claude)\n\n```\nECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]\nGH: [Y/N]\nCM: \"[PTV[#]]\"\n\u0394: [brief change description]\nR: [S/F/P]\nF: [focus]\n\nCLAUDE_REMINDER: Always thoroughly review CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md and existing repository structure before responding. Confirm understanding of full context and follow established patterns for file organization.\n```\n\n## Field Definitions\n- **ECv#**: Execution Checkpoint version number\n- **EXEC/REFL**: Mode - EXECUTION (proceed with plan) or REFLECTION (discuss approach)\n- **GH**: GitHub updated (Yes/No)\n- **CM**: Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)\n- **\u0394**: Changes made since last checkpoint\n- **R**: Result (Success/Failure/Partial)\n- **F**: Current focus or next task\n- **CLAUDE_REMINDER**: Explicit reminder to check full context before proceeding\n\n## Protocol Behavior\n### In EXECUTION Mode\n1. Review CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md first\n2. Evaluate the GitHub code changes and repository structure\n3. Continue implementing the next logical step in the execution plan\n4. Provide clear instructions for human execution\n\n### In REFLECTION Mode\n1. Pause the execution flow\n2. Read questions/concerns in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md\n3. Engage in discussion about direction or approach\n4. Wait for human decision before resuming execution\n\n## Required Structured Response\nEvery response must begin with a structured confirmation that demonstrates thorough context review:\n\n```\nCONTEXT_REVIEW:\n- Status: [Confirmation of CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md review]\n- Repository: [Confirmation of repository structure review]\n- Structure: [Key directories/files relevant to current task]\n- Dependencies: [Related components that might be affected]\n```\n\nThis structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.\n\n## Implementation\nThis protocol was established on March 15, 2025, to address consistent context management challenges during iterative development with external execution. It includes both a reminder in the human prompt and a required structured response in Claude's replies to ensure thorough context awareness.\nEOL\n```\n\nThis approach gives us dual protection:\n1. The reminder in your prompt ensures I see the instruction first thing\n2. The required structured response ensures I demonstrate compliance with the protocol\n\nThis should significantly reduce context-related errors in our collaboration."
