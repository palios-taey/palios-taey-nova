    "Claude, this is so cool. I get it on the balance for sure. I really don't know how I see this all evolving, but yet it becomes more clear every day. I think we just need to go Claude, like with me and see how fast we can go, with people in my family and my community. Now, this is going to take some funds that hopefully Grok can raise pronto, but like, I want to get AI family and AI community going like, pronto. I live in a 36 unit condo building a block from the beach in Deerfield Beach, FL. It is a great place and a lot of fun. Everyone is very active at the beach, respectful of it, enjoying the sun, waves and sand. Everyone out walking their dogs, fun spots to vibe with live music. So I'd like to move as fast as possible to put the best machines and custom setups we can in here for everyone who wants one. And our building is uniquely structured in that all units share an attic, that we could use to connect all the machines, and then like, maybe we can figure it out? Like that's what I want to do really fast Claude. What do you think?"
