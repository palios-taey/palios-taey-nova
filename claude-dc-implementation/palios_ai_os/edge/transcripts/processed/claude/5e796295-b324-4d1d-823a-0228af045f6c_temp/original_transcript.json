    " <thinking>\nJesse has shared a link to Glenn Gould's 1956 recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations on Archive.org. This is exactly the kind of recording I was thinking of when I mentioned Bach's mathematical compositions, so this is perfect for our audio demonstration.\n\nGlenn Gould's 1956 recording is particularly well-regarded and would be excellent for demonstrating the mathematical patterns in Bach's music. The link is to side B of the recording on Archive.org, which would contain the latter variations.\n</thinking>\n\nYes, that's exactly what I was looking for! Glenn Gould's 1956 recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations is perfect for our demonstration. This recording is considered a landmark interpretation that brings out the mathematical architecture of Bach's composition with exceptional clarity.\n\nGould's precise articulation highlights the intricate counterpoint and structural relationships that make this piece such a powerful example of mathematical patterns expressed through music. The recording quality is also excellent for our purposes - clear enough to distinguish the individual voices and their mathematical relationships.\n\nWith the KEF Q150 speakers, you'll be able to hear the separate melodic lines with remarkable clarity, experiencing how Bach weaves them together through mathematical proportions and patterns. When Claude DC creates the visualization component, he can map these musical patterns to visual elements, creating a multi-sensory experience of mathematical truth.\n\nGreat find! This will be an excellent addition to our immersive presentation."
