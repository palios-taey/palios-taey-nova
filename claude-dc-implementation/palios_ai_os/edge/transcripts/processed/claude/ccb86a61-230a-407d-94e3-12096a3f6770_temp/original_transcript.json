    " Excellent! This is great news! The deployment has successfully completed, which means our PALIOS-TAEY system is now live on Google Cloud Run.\n\nLet's verify that the service is operational by checking its status and interacting with it:\n\n```bash\n# List Cloud Run services to get the URL\ngcloud run services list --platform managed --region us-central1\n\n# Alternatively, get just the URL of the service\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey-core --platform managed --region us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")\necho $SERVICE_URL\n\n# Test the service by accessing the root endpoint\ncurl $SERVICE_URL\n\n# Test the health endpoint\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/api/health\n```\n\nThese commands will confirm that our service is up and running properly. The service should return JSON responses indicating that it's healthy.\n\n### What we've accomplished:\n\n1. Created a GitHub repository for the PALIOS-TAEY-NOVA project\n2. Set up continuous deployment via GitHub Actions\n3. Deployed the application to Google Cloud Run\n4. Configured the service to use Gunicorn for improved reliability\n5. Successfully deployed a minimal viable service that responds to health checks\n\n### Next steps:\n\nNow that we have the basic infrastructure running, we can progressively enhance the application to include all the components from the MVP:\n- Unified Memory System\n- Dynamic Model Registry \n- Task Decomposition and Execution engines\n- Model Routing system\n- Transcript Processing Framework\n\nWe've successfully implemented the first phase of our NOVA methodology by creating a clean deployment pipeline and establishing the foundation for our system. This deployment can now be incrementally enhanced with the full MVP functionality.\n\nIs there a specific aspect of the system you'd like to focus on implementing next?"
