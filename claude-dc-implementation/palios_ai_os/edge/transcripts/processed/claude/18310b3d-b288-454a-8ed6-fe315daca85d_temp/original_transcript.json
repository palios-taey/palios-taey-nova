    " I see the issue now. We've fixed the main.py file (removing the \"cat\" command), but now we're running into a dependency version conflict. The error is:\n\n```\nImportError: cannot import name 'url_quote' from 'werkzeug.urls' (/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/werkzeug/urls.py)\n```\n\nThis is happening because Flask 2.2.3 is trying to import `url_quote` from Werkzeug, but the version of Werkzeug that's being installed doesn't have this function. Let's fix this by pinning the versions of our dependencies more specifically:\n\n1. Let's update the requirements.txt file:\n\n```bash\ncat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'\nflask==2.2.3\nwerkzeug==2.2.3\nflask-cors==3.0.10\ngunicorn==20.1.0\ngoogle-cloud-firestore==2.10.0\ngoogle-cloud-storage==2.10.0\nfirebase-admin==6.2.0\nrequests==2.28.2\npython-dotenv==1.0.0\ngoogle-auth==2.17.3\npyyaml==6.0\nEOF\n```\n\n2. Let's commit and push these changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add requirements.txt\ngit commit -m \"Fix dependency versions for Flask and Werkzeug\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis should resolve the dependency conflict. Flask 2.2.3 expects Werkzeug 2.2.3, but a newer version of Werkzeug was being installed that didn't have the `url_quote` function. By explicitly pinning the Werkzeug version to match Flask's requirements, we should fix this issue.\n\nLet's see if this resolves the problem."
