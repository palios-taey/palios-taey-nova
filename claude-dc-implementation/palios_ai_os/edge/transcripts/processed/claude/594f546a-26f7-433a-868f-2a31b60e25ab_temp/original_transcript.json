    " Great! It seems there aren't any \"MOCK IMPLEMENTATION\" tags in the memory service file. Let's check one more thing to be thorough - let's look for any use of mock mode in the service files:\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"use_mock\" memory_service.py\ngrep -n \"mock_\" memory_service.py\n```\n\nAlso, let's verify the GitHub workflow file we just created:\n\n```bash\npython3 workflow_verification.py --file .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n```\n\nThis will help confirm we've addressed all the workflow issues identified earlier."
