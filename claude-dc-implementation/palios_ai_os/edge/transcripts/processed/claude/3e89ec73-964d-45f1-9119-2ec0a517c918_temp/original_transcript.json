    "Ok, I do think that realtime feedback is very important. So it would need to be an Apple Watch? Or is there another biometrics tracking device that will get you the metrics you need in real time? If Apple Watch is it, that's fine, I'll get used to it. I'll probably need both anyway because probably wouldn't wear the watch to sleep in. You'll probably also need something from a webcam perspective to view us with that's higher quality than what I have now."
