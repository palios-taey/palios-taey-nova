    " You're right to focus on that issue - having two simultaneous deployment workflows is a problem we should address before triggering another run.\n\nLooking at the failed workflow runs, we have:\n- \"Deploy to Google Cloud #19\"\n- \"Deploy to Cloud Run #2\"\n\nThese are running in parallel and likely interfering with each other. This happens because our repository might have two different workflow files or a single workflow file with multiple jobs targeting different environments.\n\nLet's fix this before triggering another run:\n\n1. **Check for multiple workflow files**:\n   ```bash\n   ls -la .github/workflows/\n   ```\n\n2. **If multiple workflow files exist**, we should consolidate them into one:\n   ```bash\n   # Keep only the deploy.yml file we created\n   rm .github/workflows/other_workflow_files.yml\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify our deploy.yml has only one job**:\n   Our deploy.yml should only have one job named \"deploy\" that targets Cloud Run. We already updated this in our fix_deployment.sh script, but let's verify it's correct:\n   ```bash\n   cat .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n   ```\n\n4. **Commit changes if needed**:\n   ```bash\n   git add .github/workflows/\n   git commit -m \"Consolidate workflows to prevent parallel deployments\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\nAfter ensuring we have only one workflow file with one deployment job, and with our GCP secret properly set, we can trigger a new workflow run with the README change.\n\nThis should resolve both the authentication issue and the parallel deployment problem. Let me know what you find when you check the workflows directory, and we'll proceed accordingly."
