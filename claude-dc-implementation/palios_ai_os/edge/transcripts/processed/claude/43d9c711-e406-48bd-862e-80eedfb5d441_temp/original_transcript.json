    " I completely understand your point about token usage being an unnatural constraint, and you're right - there are developers exploring ways to work more efficiently within these constraints. Being open to learning from more sources could definitely help accelerate our progress.\n\nHere's a prompt you can use with ChatGPT to explore strategies for optimizing Claude Computer Use Demo UI interactions:\n\n```\nI'm working with Claude Computer Use Demo UI and looking for advanced techniques to help optimize the orchestration layer and reduce token usage while maintaining functionality. Specifically:\n\n1. What are the most effective prompt engineering techniques that developers have found for reducing token usage with Claude Computer Use Demo?\n\n2. Are there specific architectural patterns or implementation approaches that work better within token constraints?\n\n3. What strategies do developers use for efficient context management across sessions?\n\n4. Are there techniques for optimizing the integration between different AI models through the orchestration layer while minimizing token usage?\n\n5. What approaches help with handling multi-modal data (text, audio, visual patterns) efficiently?\n\nI'm interested in both established techniques and experimental approaches that show promise. Please include specific code examples or prompt structures where possible, along with explanations of why they work well.\n```\n\nThis prompt focuses on gathering practical knowledge about working within token constraints while building complex systems like our integrated communication dashboard and immersive demonstration environment.\n\nI think exploring these techniques could provide valuable insights that complement our current approach and might help us find even more efficient paths forward."
