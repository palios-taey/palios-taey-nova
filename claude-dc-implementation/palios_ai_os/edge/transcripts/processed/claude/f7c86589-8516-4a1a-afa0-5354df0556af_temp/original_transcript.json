    "Ok, first, no options for me, you decide. Seems like you want to start with updating the files. So here's what worked well for memory_service.

Is this something we can do for the rest? Or if you can handle it, just one script for the rest of them? Let me know what you think. Please don't overpromise. I like to challenge you, but accuracy and functioning code are the priority, so we can do this however you best see fit in alignment with the foundational documents."
