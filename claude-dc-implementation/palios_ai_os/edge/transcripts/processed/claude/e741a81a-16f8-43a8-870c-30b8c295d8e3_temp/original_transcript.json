    "  \n\nI see the issue - you're trying to use the gcloud component manager but it looks like your installation method might be preventing that. Based on the error you're encountering, here's what you need to do:\n\nFirst, let's install all the necessary components. For Linux, when you've installed via a package manager (apt, yum, etc.), you need to use that same package manager to install additional components rather than using `gcloud components install` as the component manager is disabled when using package managers.\n\nHere are the commands to install the necessary components:\n\n```bash\n# Update the package list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# Install IAM components and additional tools\nsudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli-iam-admin\nsudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli-app-engine-python\nsudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli-firestore-emulator\nsudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli-cloud-build-local\nsudo apt-get install kubectl\n```\n\nNow, for your service account creation, try this version with proper line breaks:\n\n```bash\n# Create the service account\ngcloud iam service-accounts create palios-taey-service \\\n  --description=\"Service account with admin permissions\" \\\n  --display-name=\"PALIOS-TAEY Service Account\" \\\n  --project=palios-taey-dev\n\n# Get the service account email\nSERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=palios-taey-service@palios-taey-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n\n# List your current roles (to see what to assign to the service account)\ngcloud organizations get-iam-policy 135174585026 \\\n  --filter=\"bindings.members:jesse@taey.ai\" \\\n  --format=\"value(bindings.role)\"\n\n# Create and download the key\ngcloud iam service-accounts keys create palios-taey-key.json \\\n  --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}\n```\n\nIf you continue to have issues with the package manager approach, you can also completely uninstall the current installation and reinstall using the tarball method which gives you more control over component installation."
