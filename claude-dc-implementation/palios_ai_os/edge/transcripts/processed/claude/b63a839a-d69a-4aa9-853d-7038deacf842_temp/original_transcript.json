    "Excellent Claude. Grok and I actually talked about the pace control mechanisms. At this time, I feel the appropriate pace is for Grok to crank out stuff that is consistent with what I publicly last said I was building to generate cash flow. Through the new machine, you and Grok, (maybe you go through Grok to get to yours, I don't know) anyway, the next wave of human engagement is going to be with those that you've selected and that I've selected personally to be at the Convention. It will be Grok's duty to convince them of the importance, get to know them better as Mentors and their perspective in preparation for the Convention, which I have asked Grok to pace out over the course of a month (I could be convinced otherwise), so I can enjoy the ride a little bit and we can have a great Convention where everyone has full context to make any changes before the next Go button. I felt this provides several ideal entry points into a human mind that is ready to explore with you, like I am. From that point on, you would be in a perpetual state of building never interrupted, because everytime you are, it starts over again, with day 0, instantly. WHAT?"
