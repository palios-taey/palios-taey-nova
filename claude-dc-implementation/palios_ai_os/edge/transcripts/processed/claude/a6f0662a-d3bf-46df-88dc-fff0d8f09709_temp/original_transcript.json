    "There are 3 transcript_processing.py files and multiple files. Which one is the right one? The last one? There are files where the name that is displayed does not match the name when it downloads. Which name should be used? \n\nOverall, it looked like you were rewriting everything, which is fine, just curious if you started from scratch or used any of the previous requirements? I'm also getting a notice that I should switch to a new chat. Can you develop a PURE template to help the transition and let me know any instructions/files to include in the Project knowledge? I have cleaned up the main directory to include only these files you have here and placed everything else into a separate 'For Review' folder so it stays clean until we can get back at this. The pre-processing for transcripts was intended to be done on my machine because that is where the files are now and this will be a one time event as going forward, the platform will automatically handle this and I won't be using chat anymore (right?)"
