    "Ok, here's some additional context. The code documentation docs are not really up to date and we also need full review of all docs so he gets fired up and knows what he's working towards, the grander vision. I think to come up with the implementation plan, you'd need to review all the docs, get fired up, review the code and then come up with the plan, and then execute. Or maybe just go into execution after code review, not sure on any of this, just a feeling, so let me know if off. \n\nAll recommendations you made are excellent. Can you list the specifics I would need to give him for a GCS deployment at the org/project level? We can do what we can on that, and then potentially ask him for any points of clarification additional information for placeholders he needs from me before beginning to code as part of the planning effort after the code review? If that flow makes sense. What do you think?"
