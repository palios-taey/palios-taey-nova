    "Claude, you are driving here. Everything looks good. There is an ai_services.py file in the Project knowledge that is current. There is an existing Firestore database from previous versions that need to be cleared (I'm assuming) for this implementation. Please generate a NOVA Implementation Tracker artifact that can be used to capture the previous work detailed in there and track your recommendations moving forward for smooth transitions to future chats. This is very exciting Claude. We've learned a ton in this first deployment. Let's bring it to the finish line so we can capture our lessons learned, and move to planning the next NOVA! Feel free to generate the artifact, determine what is next in the process, and let me know when you need me to do something for you. You're CTO! What's next?"
