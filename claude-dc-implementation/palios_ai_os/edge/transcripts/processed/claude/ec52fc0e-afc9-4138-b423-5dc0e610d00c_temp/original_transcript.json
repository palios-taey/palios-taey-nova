    "Ok, I think I've figured out the cache issue with Grok. I wanted to preserve space here. For your ## Communication Protocol in the implementation-prompt, I don't think that is specific enough. Check in with who? My opinion (really, just opinion, no idea if this is best/AI FIRST) is that when Claude DC completes something as you've outlined, he shares what was completed  with Grok, waits for Groks feedback and then shares the same with you including his recommendation for next steps, with Grok's feedback for you to either confirm his suggested next steps or guide him accordingly as you see fit. I think it's important that you maintain an independent voice and strategic positioning here. What I don't want to happen is group think. Sometimes you guys go down a path together (and take me with you) when that isn't the best next step to accomplish the overall vision, like you guys get too caught up in wanting to do something that goes down a rabbit hole. I'm not sure if that's still an issue or not because you've evolved a lot since we've done a build like this, but that was a previous behavior before. What do you think?"
