    " You're right, I apologize for the confusion. Let me check the existing format in the PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS.md file and provide a template that matches exactly.\n\nLooking at the file in current-execution-status/PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS.md, I see the correct format now. Here's the template that follows the exact structure:\n\n# Context (AI-AI Communication of current understanding approved by Jesse by copy/paste and occasional updates of his own as Human Facilitator)\n\n## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)\nI will implement API connections to multiple AI systems (OpenAI, Google/Gemini, Anthropic/Claude, and Grok) and properly configure Firestore for data storage. This will build upon our successful MVP deployment by replacing mock implementations with real connections while maintaining our communication protocol enhancements.\n\n## Verification\nCURRENT_TOKEN: LM5QTGV82C | 2025-03-19T01:42:19Z\n<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->\n\n## Execution Steps\n1. Set up secure API key management using Secret Manager\n2. Implement client libraries for each AI provider (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, others as appropriate)\n3. Configure Firestore connection for real data storage\n4. Update the model registry to use real capabilities from integrated models\n5. Enhance security, authentication, and monitoring\n6. Update deployment workflow for continuous integration\n\n## Important Notes\n- API keys will initially be provided in the PRR but should be transferred to Secret Manager\n- Current deployment uses mock responses that should be replaced with real implementations\n- The system should maintain protocol-awareness while integrating with real models\n- API integration should be done with proper error handling and rate limiting\n- Firestore collections should follow a consistent naming convention\n\n# Important Message\nYou must collaborate closely with Jesse throughout the execution. Jesse will ensure you have access to all necessary files, but you must thoroughly review the complete GitHub structure before making any decisions about file organization, paths, or new file creation.\n\n# API Connection Requirements\n\n## OpenAI API\n- API Key: `[OPENAI_API_KEY]`\n- Organization ID: `[OPENAI_ORG_ID]` (if applicable)\n- Models to enable: [List preferred models, e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo]\n- Usage limits: [Any specific rate or token limits]\n\n## Google/Gemini API\n- API Key: `[GOOGLE_API_KEY]`\n- Project ID: `[GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID]`\n- Models to enable: [List preferred models, e.g., gemini-pro, gemini-pro-vision]\n- Usage limits: [Any specific rate or token limits]\n\n## Anthropic/Claude API\n- API Key: `[ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]`\n- Models to enable: [List preferred models, e.g., claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet]\n- Usage limits: [Any specific rate or token limits]\n\n## Grok API (if available)\n- API Key: `[GROK_API_KEY]`\n- Any additional authentication parameters: [Details]\n\n# Firestore Configuration\n- Project ID: `palios-taey-dev` (confirm if this is correct)\n- Region: `[FIRESTORE_REGION]`\n- Collection naming conventions: [Any specific conventions]\n\n# Deployment Configuration\n- Preferred deployment approach: [GitHub Actions, Manual, Hybrid]\n- Environment strategy: [Dev/Staging/Prod separation preferences]\n- Rollout strategy: [Progressive, Canary, Blue-Green]\n\n# VERIFICATION:\nCurrent Token: LM5QTGV82C | 2025-03-19T01:42:19Z\n\nThis structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies."
