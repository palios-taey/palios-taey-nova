    " You're right - let's be strategic about our additions. Looking at what we have, the most efficient next step is adding AI model capabilities registration because it will:\n\n1. Allow us to make smarter decisions about which AI to use for each task\n2. Create a foundation for multiple AI collaboration\n3. Avoid rework when we add more complex features \n\nI've added:\n1. AI model capability registration in initialization\n2. Smart model selection based on task requirements\n3. Basic complexity assessment for task routing\n\nThis creates a foundation for:\n- Multiple AI collaboration (we now know what each AI can do)\n- Task optimization (routing to the most appropriate model)\n- Future scaling (easy to add new models and capabilities)\n\nLet's test it to make sure it works with our existing functionality:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nOnce we confirm this works, we can build on it for multi-AI collaboration."
