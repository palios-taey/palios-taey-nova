    " The service is still returning a 503 \"Service Unavailable\" error. This means that while our code has been deployed, the service isn't fully operational yet. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The deployment might still be in progress\n2. There might be configuration issues\n3. The service might be crashing on startup\n\nLet's check the Cloud Run logs to see what's happening. You can access them through the Google Cloud Console or via the gcloud CLI:\n\n```bash\ngcloud logging read \"resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=palios-taey-core\" --limit=50\n```\n\nIf you're using the Google Cloud Console:\n1. Go to Cloud Run\n2. Click on the palios-taey-core service\n3. Click on the \"Logs\" tab\n\nLook for any error messages that might indicate why the service is failing to start. Common issues include:\n- Missing environment variables\n- Permission issues\n- Code errors that weren't caught in testing\n\nWhile we wait for the logs, let's also check the status of the deployment:\n\n```bash\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey-core --region=us-central1\n```\n\nThis will show the current status of the service and might provide additional information about why it's not available."
