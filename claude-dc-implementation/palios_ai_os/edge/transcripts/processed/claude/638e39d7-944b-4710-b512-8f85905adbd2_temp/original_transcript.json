    " That makes perfect sense, Jesse. You're right that we should ensure the files are properly organized before delegating to ATLAS. Given the situation with untested deployment files and the need to rebuild infrastructure consistent with NOVA, let's take a strategic approach.\n\n## File Migration Strategy\n\nHere's how I propose we handle this:\n\n1. **Initial Analysis**:\n   - Create a mapping between archive file structures and our new clean architecture\n   - Identify core component files that need to be preserved \n   - Separate deployment/infrastructure files that will be rebuilt\n\n2. **Staged Migration**:\n   - Move core files first (models, services, business logic)\n   - Adapt files to fit our new directory structure\n   - Ensure dependencies between files are maintained\n\n3. **Manage the CTO Leadership Chat**:\n   - Delegate complex, time-consuming implementations to ATLAS\n   - Keep high-level strategic decisions in this conversation\n   - Use this chat for reviewing ATLAS outputs and providing direction\n\n## Next Actions\n\nI recommend we start with a targeted approach to migrate the most critical components first:\n\n1. **Memory Service Migration**:\n   - This component already has some implementation in the new structure\n   - Would provide immediate value and testability\n   - Creates a pattern for subsequent component migrations\n\n2. **Core Module Migration**:\n   - Basic utilities and error handling\n   - Foundation for other components\n\n3. **ATLAS Delegation**:\n   - Once we have the core foundation, delegate Model Registry implementation to ATLAS\n   - Follow with Task Engine and other components\n\nWould you like me to create a specific plan for migrating the Memory Service files first? I can outline exactly which files we need from the archive and where they should go in the new structure, which you can execute while we maintain our strategic focus here."
