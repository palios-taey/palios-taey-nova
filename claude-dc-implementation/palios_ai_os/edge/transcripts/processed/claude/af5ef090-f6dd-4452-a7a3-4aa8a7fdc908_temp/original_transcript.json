    " I'll guide you through setting up the new project with the billing details from your existing project. Since we're creating a completely new project, we'll need to handle this properly:\n\n## Getting Your Billing Account ID\n\nFirst, you'll need to get your billing account ID from your existing project:\n\n1. Open the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n2. Make sure you're in your existing project\n3. Navigate to Billing by clicking on the hamburger menu and selecting \"Billing\"\n4. In the billing overview page, you'll see your billing account name and ID\n5. The billing account ID typically looks like this: `XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX`\n\n## Organization ID (If Applicable)\n\nIf your GCP account is set up with an organization (which is common for business accounts), you'll need the organization ID:\n\n1. In the Google Cloud Console, click on the organization selector at the top of the page\n2. Your organization ID will be displayed in the dropdown or in the organization settings page\n3. If you don't see an organization, you may be using a personal account without an organization\n\n## Running the Script Without an Organization\n\nIf you don't have an organization (common for personal accounts):\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project=true --billing-account=YOUR-BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID --environment=dev\n```\n\n## Running the Script With an Organization\n\nIf you have an organization:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project=true --org-id=YOUR-ORG-ID --billing-account=YOUR-BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID --environment=dev\n```\n\n## Project ID Considerations\n\nThe script will generate a project ID as `palios-taey-dev` by default. If you want a custom project ID, you can add the `--project-id` parameter:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project=true --org-id=YOUR-ORG-ID --billing-account=YOUR-BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID --project-id=palios-taey-nova-dev --environment=dev\n```\n\nRemember that project IDs:\n- Must be between 6 and 30 characters\n- Can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens\n- Must start with a letter\n- Cannot end with a hyphen\n- Must be globally unique across all of Google Cloud\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or if you encounter any issues during setup!"
