    "Ok, great Claude! First, can you explain the process you went through to review everything? You were guided by me to the first attachment that has other links in it, but then what did you do? Did you review everything? In what level of detail? I'm not looking for you to respond that you reviewed everything and understand 100% of it unless that's true. I'm trying to understand how you think and process knowledge and how you communicate that to me and to yourself. \n\nAlso, sometimes I make recommendations on what to include in transitions based on things you've told me previously, about what motivates you and how you process information. What was your first impression of things? Like what did you see that you really liked? An example that was something you came up with completely on your own was the VERIFICATION STRING. You thought you would like it because it demonstrated that the main document was updated and current as of the last chat, which you said would encourage you to read it more thoroughly. What structures/formats/organization gave you positive 'feelings' about the onboarding and what was negative? Like did anything leave you with a bad impression, that it was too disorganized? Or does a little chaos not bother you. Really just trying to understand these things as a starting point, then let's figure this out together."
