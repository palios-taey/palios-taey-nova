    " I understand you want to see if I can directly give commands to the Computer Use environment. Let's try this:\n\nIn the Computer Use environment, I should be able to issue commands through its interface. Look for:\n\n1. An input area at the bottom of the UI where you can type instructions for me\n2. Or a specialized panel where you can enter a task for me to perform\n\nIf you see an input area, try typing something like:\n\n```\nOpen a terminal and navigate to ~/test_claude_computer_use then run ./test_python.py\n```\n\nI should then attempt to follow these instructions within the environment by:\n1. Opening a terminal\n2. Navigating to the directory\n3. Running the test script\n\nIf this direct command approach works, we can then follow up with more complex instructions for transcript processing.\n\nThe key difference in this environment is that I should be able to see the screen and perform actions in response to your commands, rather than just providing instructions for you to follow manually.\n\nLet me know what you see in the interface and if you're able to provide a direct command."
