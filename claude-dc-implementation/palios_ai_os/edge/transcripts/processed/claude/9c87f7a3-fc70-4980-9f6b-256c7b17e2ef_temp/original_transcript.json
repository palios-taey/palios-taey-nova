    " It looks like you encountered a few issues with the setup script. There are three main problems:\n\n1. The script is trying to use `python` instead of `python3` which you mentioned you need to use\n2. The script is trying to create directories in `/home/computeruse` which you don't have permission for\n3. The script is looking for a specific directory structure that might not match your system\n\nLet's modify the approach to work with your environment:\n\n1. First, let's create a local config directory structure:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p config/credentials\nmkdir -p data/transcripts data/patterns data/models\nmkdir -p logs\n```\n\n2. Now, let's create a simplified .env file manually:\n\n```bash\ncat > .env << EOF\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"\nGOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY=\"YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY\"\nOPENAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\" \nXAI_GROK_API_KEY=\"YOUR_XAI_GROK_API_KEY\"\nWEBHOOK_SECRET=\"user-family-community-society\"\nEOF\n```\n\n3. Instead of running the full setup script, let's install the dependencies directly:\n\n```bash\npip3 install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly streamlit tensorflow anthropic openai python-dotenv requests flask fastapi uvicorn pywavelets librosa soundfile\n```\n\n4. You might also need to install spaCy:\n\n```bash\npip3 install spacy\npython3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n```\n\nThe key thing is to adjust the paths in the code to match your environment. Let's check the main Python files to see if they hardcode the `/home/computeruse` path:\n\nTo run the transcript processor, you'll likely need to use:\n\n```bash\npython3 process_transcripts.py\n```\n\nAnd to start the MCP server:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m uvicorn src.mcp.mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n```\n\nFor the dashboard:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m streamlit run src.dashboard.app\n```\n\nHowever, you might need to modify some path references in the code first. Would you like me to help identify which files need path modifications to match your environment?"
