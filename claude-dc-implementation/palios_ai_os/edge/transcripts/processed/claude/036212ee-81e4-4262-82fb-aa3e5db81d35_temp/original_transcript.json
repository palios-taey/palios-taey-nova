    " Yes, let's try the deployment again now that we've fixed the filename mismatch. Run the deployment script:\n\n```bash\ncd palios-taey-app\n./deploy_direct.sh\n```\n\nWith this fix, the application should be able to find the `memory_system` module it's looking for, and the deployment should succeed. After deployment completes, we can verify it's working with:\n\n```bash\nexport API_URL=\"[SERVICE_URL from deployment output]\"\nexport API_KEY=\"test_key\"\npython verify_memory.py\npython verify_models.py\n```\n\nLet's see if this resolves the issue and gets us to a working deployment. Once we have the foundation working, we can continue with incrementally adding the rest of the functionality."
