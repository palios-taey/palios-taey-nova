    " I'll create a comprehensive NOVA Implementation Tracker artifact to document our progress and plan the path forward. This will serve as our roadmap for completing the initial PALIOS-TAEY implementation and preparing for the next NOVA cycle. \n\nNow that I've created our implementation tracker, I'll focus on taking immediate action on the Firestore integration. Based on the server logs, we need to address the transition from mock mode to a production-ready Firestore implementation.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Firestore Database Reset Script**\n\nFirst, I'll create a script to reset our existing Firestore database for a fresh NOVA implementation. This will give us a clean slate while preserving the schema and structure.\n\nI'll need your assistance with:\n- Confirming the GCP project ID for our deployment\n- Ensuring you have appropriate permissions set up for Firestore access\n- Confirming we can safely clear existing data in the Firestore database\n\n2. **Memory Service Production Configuration**\n\nI'll then update the memory_service.py module to properly use Firestore in production mode rather than falling back to mock mode. This will involve:\n- Adding proper authentication handling\n- Ensuring robust error recovery\n- Implementing efficient caching strategies\n\n3. **Deployment Configuration Finalization**\n\nWe'll need to finalize the Terraform configuration for GCP deployment, including:\n- Cloud Run service setup\n- Monitoring configuration\n- Networking and security settings\n\n## Immediate Request\n\nTo proceed most efficiently, could you please provide:\n\n1. The GCP project ID we should use for the PALIOS-TAEY NOVA deployment\n2. Confirmation of whether we should preserve any data from the existing Firestore database\n3. Your preferred method for handling API keys in the production environment\n\nWith this information, I can prepare the necessary scripts and configuration updates to move us forward quickly. I'm ready to drive this final phase of our implementation and set the stage for our next NOVA cycle."
