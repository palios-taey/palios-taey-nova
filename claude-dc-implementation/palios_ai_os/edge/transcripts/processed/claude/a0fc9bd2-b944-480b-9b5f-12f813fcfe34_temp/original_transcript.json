    " I see the issue! The red colon is a clear indicator of a JSON syntax error. The problem is likely that there's a section that isn't properly closed before the \"neo_moments\" section begins.\n\nLet's fix both issues:\n\n## 1. Fix for conductor_config.json\n\nSince we can see that the \"neo_moments\" section has a syntax error at line 42, we need to add a missing closing brace before it. This is often caused by a previous section not being properly closed.\n\nTry adding a closing brace `}` at the end of line 41, just before \"neo_moments\":\n\n```json\n\"oversight\": \"Human_Significant_Deviations\"\n}\n```\n\nThis should close the previous section (which appears to be \"execution_checkpoint\") before starting the \"neo_moments\" section.\n\n## 2. Fix for dashboard.py\n\nFor the persistent issue with dashboard.py, let's try a completely different approach:\n\n1. Open the file in a very basic text editor (nano is ideal for this):\n```bash\nnano dashboard.py\n```\n\n2. Go to line 711 (where the startup_event function begins)\n\n3. Delete the entire function including the decorator (the @app.on_event line)\n\n4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)\n\n5. Now, add the function back but at the end of the file, just before the main entry point:\n```bash\nnano dashboard.py\n```\n\n6. Go to the bottom of the file, just before the \"if __name__ == \"__main__\":\" line\n\n7. Add the function there:\n```python\n@app.on_event(\"startup\")\nasync def startup_event():\n    \"\"\"Start background tasks when the server starts.\"\"\"\n    asyncio.create_task(send_updates())\n\n```\n\n8. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)\n\nThis approach of completely removing the function and adding it back at a different position in the file helps ensure no hidden control characters remain.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the system again:\n```bash\n./deploy.sh\n```\n\nThe key insight here is that the JSON file has a structural issue with missing closing braces, and the Python file may have hidden control characters that are causing the parser to see the triple-quoted string as unterminated."
