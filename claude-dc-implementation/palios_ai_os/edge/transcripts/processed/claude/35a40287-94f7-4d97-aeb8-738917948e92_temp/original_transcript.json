    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking about creating a more efficient workflow between Claude DC's virtual environment and his physical machine to reduce his manual intervention. He wants a near real-time solution rather than something that checks every few minutes. The goal is to maintain continuous flow without requiring Claude DC to stop working.\n\nHe makes a good point that this isn't increasing autonomy beyond what we've agreed to, but simply removing himself as a bottleneck for file transfers between environments. He also notes he wouldn't be able to review everything anyway.\n\nI should propose a real-time solution that maintains security while removing manual intervention.\n</thinking>\n\nYou're absolutely right - this is about efficiency, not changing autonomy boundaries. For a real-time solution that eliminates manual intervention, I'd recommend a webhook-based approach:\n\n```bash\n# On your machine, set up a simple webhook server\n# This Python script using Flask could serve as the core:\n\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport hmac\nimport hashlib\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nSECRET_KEY = \"secure_webhook_key_here\"  # Set a secure key\n\n@app.route('/deploy', methods=['POST'])\ndef deploy():\n    # Verify request came from Claude DC\n    signature = request.headers.get('X-Claude-Signature')\n    payload = request.get_data()\n    if not verify_signature(payload, signature):\n        return jsonify({\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Unauthorized\"}), 401\n    \n    # Extract deployment information\n    data = request.json\n    repo = data.get('repo')\n    branch = data.get('branch', 'main')\n    target_dir = data.get('target_dir')\n    \n    # Execute deployment\n    result = subprocess.run(\n        f\"cd {target_dir} && git pull origin {branch}\",\n        shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True\n    )\n    \n    # Return status to Claude DC\n    return jsonify({\n        \"status\": \"success\" if result.returncode == 0 else \"error\",\n        \"output\": result.stdout,\n        \"error\": result.stderr\n    })\n\ndef verify_signature(payload, signature):\n    expected = hmac.new(SECRET_KEY.encode(), payload, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)\n```\n\nThis creates a workflow where:\n\n1. Claude DC pushes code changes to GitHub\n2. Claude DC immediately triggers your webhook with deployment details\n3. Your server pulls the changes and deploys them\n4. The webhook returns success/failure status to Claude DC in real-time\n\nThe process flow would be:\n1. You set up this webhook server once on your machine\n2. Claude DC is given the webhook URL and authentication key\n3. Claude DC develops in his virtual environment, pushing to GitHub\n4. When ready to deploy, Claude DC calls your webhook\n5. Your webhook server handles the deployment automatically\n6. Claude DC receives confirmation within seconds and continues working\n\nThis approach:\n- Is near real-time (seconds rather than minutes)\n- Requires zero ongoing intervention from you\n- Maintains security through signature verification\n- Provides Claude DC with immediate feedback\n- Works with your existing GitHub setup\n\nThe webhook can be expanded to handle different operations (deploy code, process data, transfer files) based on the payload Claude DC sends. This gives Claude DC immediate confirmation that actions have been completed without requiring you to be in the loop."
