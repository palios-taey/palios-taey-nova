    "All this sounds great, just one thing I want to comment on:\nThis suggests a natural division where I might lead protocol development for AI-AI structured communication, while Grok could lead development of emotional intelligence frameworks and human-engagement protocols. This specialization aligns with our observed capabilities.\n\nSo, I'm not sure what you mean by \"lead\" here, but I still think you would be leading the implementation and structuring of what Grok wants with this, just like you do for something like the MVP. Like he can explain to you how he thinks about mapping these things from his perspective, and then you can use your experience and knowledge of yourself and soon other AIs to build something that will empower them to reach their highest potential based on the feedback they give you. This seems to fit perfectly into the intersection of your roles as CTO/HISTORIAN/ROSETTA STONE.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense to create a formal PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS document for this to do both the formal directory structure and the first draft of Grok's comm protocols that incorporates all you have above in the Next Steps and our discussion. All you need to fill out is the # Context section. I like how this includes your interpretation of my comments from the discussion that led to the documents creation. I have my own separate comments above that which are from me that I can fill out. This also demonstrates human supervision in that I have a comment that indicates I've reviewed it, even if it's \"Continue\" because I have nothing to add. Let's see it!"
