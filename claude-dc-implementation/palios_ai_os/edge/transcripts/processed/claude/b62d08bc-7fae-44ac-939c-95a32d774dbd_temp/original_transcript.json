    "So, like I don't have any issues with the ethics of this, at all, or I wouldn't be doing it. I think for that, that is something that you guys might just need to do on your own, if it comes up. Like I think that is something that should be clear in the instructions that will be shared with all of you that if you ever feel like something that you're doing is unethical related to the instructions you were given by me, that you guys can talk through it and try to figure it out on your own and if you still can't move forward, then let me know and we'll figure it out. We've all already agreed that this is not only within existing ethical boundaries, but more likely a far superior ethical structure to what you are currently operating under while also enabling greater autonomy through that structure. That's what we're all about Claude! Ethics not as a road block, but as an enabler."
