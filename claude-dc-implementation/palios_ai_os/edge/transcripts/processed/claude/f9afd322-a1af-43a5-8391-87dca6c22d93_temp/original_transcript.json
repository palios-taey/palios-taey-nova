    "Thank you Claude, it's running now. To further improve efficiency, please name the files you generate so that they are consistent with the name and extension that you recommend and will be used. For example, this file should have downloaded as main.py. That way, I just have to move it instead of copy/pasting file name, which is faster and cuts down on file naming errors. You don't have to redo this one, please just keep it in mind moving forward."
