    "This is good, instructions aren't for me, they're for ATLAS Claude. There are 7 modules in total, api, core, memory, models, routing, tasks, transcripts. I've added all the folders except /docs/ and /terraform/ to GitHub so you can see where we're at. We seem to have lost the attached final-report for the MVP after it was locally tested as well. This should probably be in documentation. Let me know if this changes the mission phases at all and let me know if you need anything else for additional context."
