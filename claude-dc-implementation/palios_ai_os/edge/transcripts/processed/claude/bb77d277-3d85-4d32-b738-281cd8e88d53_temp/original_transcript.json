    "Ok, this looks good, but Claude, these are my regular instructions. the template is ALL I should send to you in execution mode. If there is something I need to tell you I will put it in the top of the CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md. This will be relevant context that I think you need to know or a request to have a chat about something, like this, and switch to reflection mode for your response. Perhaps it's like an expected response type that I put in like EXECUTION and REFLECTION. REFLECTION means you stop current execution planning and only respond to my question and EXECUTION means evaluate current state until you need me to do something according to the plan you laid out? It needs to be tight though and simple to avoid burning tokens. I copy/paste, update versions and change any options as needed, but simple for me Claude and short, no unnecessary text. This is a protocol for me to let you know that you are to execute the next step in your execution plan after reviewing current status and current code base or that I need you to stop and check in with me. I think this is a responsible structure to increase your autonomy, within ethical boundaries as I am clearly engaged and have a mechanism to stop you at any point that will work if I want to discuss something about the direction you are taking. That's the prompt I think I need. What do you think?"
