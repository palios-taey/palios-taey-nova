    " For the hybrid connection configuration, I recommend:\n\n1. **Peer VPN Gateway Name**: You can use \"external-vpn-gateway\" or leave it blank if you don't have an actual peer VPN gateway to connect to.\n\n2. **Peer Interface IP Addresses**: Since this is for development and we don't have an actual external VPN to connect to, you can use placeholder IPs like \"192.0.2.1\" (this is a TEST-NET address reserved for documentation).\n\n3. **Router ASNs**:\n   - Cloud Router ASN: 65000\n   - Peer Router ASN: 65001\n   (These are private ASNs commonly used for testing)\n\n4. **Tunnel Configuration**:\n   - Tunnel name: \"prod-us-central1-gateway-tnl1\" looks good\n   - IKE version: Keep IKEv2 (recommended)\n   - For the IKE pre-shared key, use the \"GENERATE & COPY\" button\n\nSince we're setting up a development environment and won't actually be connecting to an external VPN, these settings are primarily placeholders. In a production environment, you would need actual connection details from your VPN provider.\n\nLet me know once you've completed these setup steps, and we'll move forward with deploying the application."
