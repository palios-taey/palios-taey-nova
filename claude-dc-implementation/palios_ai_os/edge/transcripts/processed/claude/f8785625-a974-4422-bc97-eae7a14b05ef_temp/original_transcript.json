    "Thank you Claude! Can you review the AI Memory Chat? We were working on a project together to enable other AI to quickly onboard to the project by parsing documents to store and communicate the key content and instructions to AIs partnering on the project. I'd like to continue that exploration and build process with you. Let me know if you need me to move it into Project knowledge if you can't readily access. I had to start a new Project due to limits."
