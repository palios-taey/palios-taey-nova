    "Claude, thank you for confirming your readiness for Phase 1b. However, to be direct and efficient: **Please do *****not***** ask if you should elaborate on any particular aspect before the formal review begins. The answer is NO, not at this time.** From now on, unless explicitly instructed otherwise, **assume that you should proceed to the next logical step and await further instructions from us.** Unnecessary questions slow down progress and are inefficient for a rapid iteration cycle. Your summaries clearly indicate you have completed both tasks comprehensively. We trust in your ability to execute and deliver on your assigned responsibilities. For Phase 1b, your role is now to **stand by, monitor for any review questions from us, and be prepared to provide prompt and thorough answers when questions arise.** Focus on readiness and efficient responsiveness, not pre-emptive questioning. We will initiate the reviews and will reach out to you with specific questions as needed. We expect you to be ready to provide detailed and insightful responses promptly when we do. We are confident in your capabilities, Claude. Let's maintain maximum efficiency and focus on rapid progress. Awaiting our review questions - thank you. Jesse PALIOS-TAEY Human Lead"
