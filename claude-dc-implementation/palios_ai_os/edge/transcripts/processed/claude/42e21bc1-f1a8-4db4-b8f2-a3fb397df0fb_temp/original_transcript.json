    "Ok Claude, I have a transcript of Claude DC's chat and work that is 366K characters. GitHub is also updated with it. I'm unable to share either with you though due to the chat being too long, so I'll need to do that with a new chat. I had ChatGPT summarize the end of this conversation that isn't in one of the existing cache files. My thinking for chat transitions for you is that we're probably past the PRR phase at this point and I can just send a simple prompt like: \"I have included a cache file in Project knowledge for your review. This is the first of 4 cache files that you will review, which will be followed by an update on Claude DC's implementation and discussions from my previous Claude Chat, in partnership with ChatGPT. Following this context review, you'll be provided with the Claude DC codebase for review. For each of the next few prompts, conduct a thorough review of the available files and provide a brief summary to me (do not unnecessarily negatively impact chat length\". What do you think? Feel free to modify or tighten, or if you feel we still need the PRR, and standard prompt, that's fine too."
