    " I see that we've already made excellent progress on the directory structure. Looking at your screenshots, I can see that you've:\n\n1. Organized code into proper directories (src/, terraform/, scripts/, etc.)\n2. Created subdirectories within src/ (api/, config/, models/, services/, utils/)\n3. Added the firestore_permissions.tf file to the terraform directory\n\nThis structure is much more organized than I initially thought. Let's leverage this existing structure rather than trying to change it. Here's what I recommend as our next steps:\n\n1. **Move Python Files to Proper Directories**: Let's move the Python files that are in the root directory to their appropriate locations in the src/ directory structure.\n\n2. **Update Environment Configuration Location**: Since our directory structure is different than initially planned, we need to make sure environment_config.py is in the right place.\n\n3. **Test the Deployment Process**: Verify that the deployment works with the updated directory structure.\n\nHere's a script that will help reorganize the files into the proper directories:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to reorganize the PALIOS-TAEY project files\n\n# Create directories if they don't exist\nmkdir -p src/api\nmkdir -p src/services\nmkdir -p src/utils\nmkdir -p src/models\nmkdir -p logs\n\n# Move Python files to appropriate directories\n# Core services\nmv -n main.py src/\nmv -n memory_service.py src/services/\nmv -n model_registry.py src/services/\nmv -n task_decomposition.py src/services/\nmv -n task_execution.py src/services/\nmv -n model_routing.py src/services/\nmv -n transcript_processor.py src/services/\n\n# Utils\nmv -n api_key_manager.py src/utils/\nmv -n ai_services.py src/utils/\nmv -n environment_config.py src/utils/\nmv -n firestore_integration.py src/utils/\n\n# Tests\nmv -n test_system.py test/\n\n# Make sure firestore_permissions.tf is in terraform directory\nif [ ! -f terraform/firestore_permissions.tf ]; then\n  echo \"Warning: firestore_permissions.tf not found in terraform directory\"\nfi\n\n# Update imports in main.py to reflect new structure\nsed -i '' 's/from memory_service import/from src.services.memory_service import/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/from model_registry import/from src.services.model_registry import/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/from task_decomposition import/from src.services.task_decomposition import/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/from model_routing import/from src.services.model_routing import/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/from task_execution import/from src.services.task_execution import/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/from transcript_processor import/from src.services.transcript_processor import/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/import environment_config/from src.utils.environment_config import initialize_environment/g' src/main.py\nsed -i '' 's/environment_config.initialize_environment()/initialize_environment()/g' src/main.py\n\necho \"Directory reorganization complete!\"\n```\n\nHowever, I notice that you've already moved some files to the correct directories. Instead of running this script which might cause issues with existing files, let's take a more targeted approach:\n\n### Next Steps for Deployment\n\n1. **Verify Environment Configuration**:\n   - Confirm that environment_config.py is in the correct location (either root or src/utils/)\n   - Make sure main.py imports it correctly\n\n2. **Update Main.py Imports**:\n   - If main.py is in the root directory but imports modules from src/, update import statements\n   - If main.py is in src/, make sure it uses relative imports correctly\n\n3. **Run Reset Firestore Script**:\n   - I see you have reset_firestore_complete.py in the project\n   - Run this script to ensure Firestore is properly set up before deployment\n\n4. **Test Deployment**:\n   - Run the build_push.sh script from the scripts directory\n   - Run the deploy.sh script to deploy to GCP\n\nWould you like me to provide a more specific script that handles just the remaining tasks based on your current directory structure? Or should we proceed directly to the deployment testing?"
