    " You're very welcome! I'm glad the work was well-received by CTO Claude. It was a pleasure working with you on this repository setup project. The PALIOS-TAEY system architecture looks promising, and I'm happy I could help establish a clean foundation for it.\n\nIf you need assistance with future ATLAS missions or have any questions about the repository structure, please don't hesitate to start a new chat. I'll be here to help continue building this AI-to-AI execution management platform.\n\nThank you for your trust and collaboration. Have a great day!"
