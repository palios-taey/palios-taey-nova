    " I've reviewed the partial implementation of the transcript_processor.py file and the directory structure. I'll now regenerate the NOVA Implementation Tracker to establish a clear understanding of our current status and next steps.\n\n# PALIOS-TAEY NOVA Implementation Tracker\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. Complete Memory Service Self-Initialization (COMPLETED)\n2. Enhance Task Execution Engine (COMPLETED)\n3. Complete Remaining Component Initializations\n   - Task Decomposition Engine (COMPLETED)\n   - Model Routing (COMPLETED)\n   - Transcript Processor (IN PROGRESS)\n4. Update Main Application Entry Point (NOT STARTED)\n5. Verify System Operation (NOT STARTED)\n6. Documentation and Analysis (NOT STARTED)\n\n## Current Status\n- System is deployed to Google Cloud Run \n- Memory service, task execution engine, task decomposition engine, and model routing components have been completed\n- Currently working on transcript_processor.py\n- The partial implementation includes:\n  - Self-initialization with fallback mechanisms\n  - Mock mode support\n  - Initial implementation of processing methods for various transcript formats\n  - Need to complete the implementation and ensure it handles all edge cases\n\n## Progress Tracking\n\n### 3. Remaining Component Initializations - Transcript Processor\n- Status: IN PROGRESS\n- Required enhancements:\n  - Complete self-initialization \u2713\n  - Add comprehensive mock mode support \u2713 (partly implemented)\n  - Complete robust error handling throughout\n  - Implement remaining methods and ensure all functionality works correctly\n  - Add status reporting for health checks \u2713 (partly implemented)\n  - Verify compatibility with other components\n  - Test all edge cases and failure modes\n\n### 4. Main Application Entry Point\n- Status: NOT STARTED\n- Requirements:\n  - Must properly initialize all components\n  - Must handle component failures gracefully\n  - Must report accurate health status for each component\n  - Must include appropriate mock mode handling\n\n### Next Immediate Steps:\n1. Complete the transcript_processor.py implementation\n   - Implement any missing methods\n   - Enhance error handling throughout\n   - Verify mock mode functionality is complete\n   - Ensure proper status reporting\n2. Update the implementation tracker once transcript_processor.py is completed\n3. Move on to the main application entry point\n\n## Critical Reminders\n- CODE MUST BE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME\n- Complete one file at a time\n- Test all edge cases mentally before implementation\n- Verify all dependencies and imports\n- Follow the pattern established in model_registry.py\n- Ensure all components initialize properly in isolation\n- Maintain clear logging for debugging\n- Handle all errors gracefully\n- STOP AND SUBMIT AFTER COMPLETING EACH FILE\n- DO NOT START THE NEXT FILE IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT SUBMITTING FIRST\n\nI've carefully analyzed the current state of the transcript_processor.py file and understand what needs to be completed. I'm ready to proceed with the implementation once you give the go-ahead."
