    " You're using macOS and need to use pip3 instead of pip. Let's install the requests package using pip3:\n\n```bash\npip3 install requests\n```\n\nIf that doesn't work, you might need to use:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install requests\n```\n\nThis will install the requests library which is needed for the test script to make HTTP calls to our API."
