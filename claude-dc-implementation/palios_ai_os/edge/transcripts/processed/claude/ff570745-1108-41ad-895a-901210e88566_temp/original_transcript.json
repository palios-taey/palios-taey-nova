    " I see the issue. Despite its appearance, this isn't actually indicating a problem with our setup. It's simply a UI warning that appears because we're using a principalSet instead of an email address, but it doesn't prevent the configuration from working.\n\n## Information Needs\nNo additional information needed.\n\n## Technical Direction\nThe error message \"Email addresses and domains must be associated with an active Google Account...\" is misleading in this context. It appears because the UI is primarily designed for regular user/group principals (like email addresses), but we're using a principalSet which follows a different format. This warning can be safely ignored for Workload Identity Federation.\n\nWhat matters is that the principal was accepted (as shown in your screenshot) and the Workload Identity User role was assigned.\n\n## Action Items - Ready for Execution\n\nLet's proceed with testing the GitHub Actions workflow:\n\n1. Save these files from the artifacts I provided earlier:\n   - `.github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudrun.yml`\n   - `Dockerfile`\n   - `requirements.txt`\n   - `main.py`\n\n2. Commit and push to your repository:\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions workflow with Workload Identity Federation\"\ngit push\n```\n\n3. Go to your GitHub repository and check the \"Actions\" tab to monitor the workflow.\n\nThe workflow should now be able to authenticate to Google Cloud using Workload Identity Federation. If any issues occur during execution, we can inspect the logs to troubleshoot. \n\nThe key test is whether the GitHub Actions workflow can successfully authenticate to GCP without using stored service account keys. Even if there are other deployment issues, if the authentication succeeds, we've achieved our primary goal of implementing Workload Identity Federation."
