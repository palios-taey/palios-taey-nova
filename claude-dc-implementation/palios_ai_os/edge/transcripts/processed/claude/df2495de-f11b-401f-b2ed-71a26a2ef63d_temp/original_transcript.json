    " Ah, we need to export the interfaces and classes. Let me fix that: \n\n\n\nI've added `export` to all the necessary types and interfaces. Try running the build again:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe key changes:\n1. Added `export` to all interfaces, enums, and classes\n2. Properly structured the Firebase integration\n3. Added type definition for BreakoutData\n4. Made all exports explicit\n\nLet me know if you encounter any other compilation errors."
