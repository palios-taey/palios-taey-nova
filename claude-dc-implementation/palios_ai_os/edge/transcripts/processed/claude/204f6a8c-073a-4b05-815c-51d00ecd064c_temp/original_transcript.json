    " Thank you for providing those key script files, Jesse. I now have a better understanding of the codebase deduplication tools we have available. Looking at the provided files (`file_deduplication.py`, `repository_report.py`, and `github_integration.py`), I can see the strategy for identifying and resolving duplicate code in the repository.\n\nBased on the current state, I see that we have:\n\n1. A clean new repository structure (`palios-taey-nova`) with directory structure established\n2. Utility scripts for deduplication and GitHub integration\n3. The need to execute the deduplication strategy on the previous codebase\n\n## Deduplication and Migration Strategy\n\nHere's my recommended approach for proceeding with the deduplication and code migration:\n\n1. **Execute Deduplication Analysis**:\n   - Run the `file_deduplication.py` script against both the old repository and new repository\n   - Generate a comprehensive deduplication report to identify all duplicates and similar files\n   - Focus especially on core functionality components that need migration\n\n2. **Prioritize Core Component Migration**:\n   - Start with the most critical components defined in our structure\n   - Migrate in a sequence that allows for incremental testing\n   - Focus on preserving functionality while adapting to the new clean structure\n\n3. **Use Targeted ATLAS Missions**:\n   - Create specific ATLAS missions for each component migration\n   - Leverage the specialized ATLAS framework to maintain focus and prevent scope creep\n   - Implement stage-gate reviews for quality control during migration\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFor immediate action, I recommend we:\n\n1. **Run the deduplication analysis**:\n   ```bash\n   python file_deduplication.py /path/to/old/repository /path/to/new/repository\n   ```\n\n2. **Launch a focused ATLAS mission for the first component migration**:\n   - I recommend starting with the Memory Service since it has the most implementation progress\n   - Follow with Model Registry as it's a critical foundation for other components\n\n3. **Set up a GitHub-Claude integration** using the provided integration script to facilitate future code reviews and commits\n\nWould you like me to proceed with drafting an ATLAS delegation brief for the deduplication analysis and initial component migration? This would define clear scope boundaries, success criteria, and technical approach for the ATLAS team member executing this mission."
