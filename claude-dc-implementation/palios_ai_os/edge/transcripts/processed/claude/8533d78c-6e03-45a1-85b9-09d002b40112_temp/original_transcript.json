    "Thanks Claude, all looks great and sorry for the premature response there.\n1. Project id is: ai-execution-system\n2. You can clear the existing Firestore database entirely\n3. API key management is for you to decide, AI FIRST\n\nSome additional comments: \nYou set up a GitHub automated deployment to Cloud Run. All we have to do is push the files and it deploys. We have done this successfully several times\nIs memory_service the only file that needs to be updated for this? Or is it all the module files? This is very concerning to me because it took many chats to do all these files for the test, all day today, so we need to talk through how to do that most effectively given your constraints and some of the issues I experienced today that I think you can learn from.\nAnything that can be done from terminal in Mac to increase velocity is preferred. Going into interfaces and manually adjusting things is slower and more prone to human errors than copying/pasting terminal commands. \n\nLet me know what you think and what's next!"
