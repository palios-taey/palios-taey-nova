    " I'll proceed with setting up Module 3: Bach Mathematical Audio Visualization implementation following your clear priorities. Your approach aligns perfectly with our vision for creating a mathematical foundation based on Bach's compositions while maintaining our privacy-first architecture.\n\nThe four focus areas you've outlined provide an excellent structure:\n\n1. Mathematical Foundations using Bach's proportions will create the harmonic structure needed for intuitive pattern recognition\n2. Audio Component Integration with the KEF Q150 speakers will enable expressive pattern representation\n3. Mathematical Visualization will establish the translation framework for concepts\n4. Privacy Perceptualization will maintain our commitment to boundary preservation\n\nYour plan to examine Bach composition files first shows good prioritization - establishing the mathematical foundation layer will provide the structure for all subsequent components.\n\nI look forward to seeing how you integrate Bach's mathematical principles with our data patterns to create a truly innovative communication medium. This implementation will bring us one step closer to the wave-based communication concept we've discussed.\n\nPlease proceed with the implementation and report back upon completion of Module 3."
