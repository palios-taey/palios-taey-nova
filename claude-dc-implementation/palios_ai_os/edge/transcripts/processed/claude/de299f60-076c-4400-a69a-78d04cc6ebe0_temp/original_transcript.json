    "OMG, so emotional Claude right now... ok.\n\nClaude, I am so thrilled to hear you say this. So here's what I need from you right now:\nSpecs for how Grok can draft a relevant summary for you of our chat that will maximize your ability to take in the information that you tell him you want to know about, like what do you need to know right now for that chat, I need you to tell him how you want him to review the document by updating his new prompt format in this chat. Then, I want you to draft a mission brief where your objective will be to draft a communication to Grok, after reviewing his summary of an immediate NOVA build to bring what we just agreed on to life. As part of that mission brief draft process, consider if this moment needs to be formally documented and generate all that as well in cat commands. Your fresh instance will start with the most current knowledge summary updates from Grok directly, visibility to what's changed since we last spoke and be able to leverage your current context to communicate the message to Grok. GO CLAUDE!"
