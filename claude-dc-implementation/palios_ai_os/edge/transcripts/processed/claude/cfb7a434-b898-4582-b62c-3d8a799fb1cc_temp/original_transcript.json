    " I understand you've encountered compilation errors, type mismatches, and integration challenges with the previous code submissions. Thank you for the detailed feedback. You're absolutely right - we need to ensure the code is truly \"plug and play\" and compile-ready.\n\nBefore I provide the revised code, I should proactively request some critical information to ensure proper integration:\n\n1. Project Structure:\n- What is the current project root structure?\n- Are there specific folders for different module types (e.g., `/src`, `/tests`, `/types`)?\n- Where should the core protocol and test files be placed?\n\n2. Dependencies:\n- Which dependencies are already in your package.json?\n- Are there specific versions of TypeScript, testing frameworks, or other libraries I should target?\n- Are there existing utility functions or shared types I should reference?\n\n3. Configuration:\n- What is your tsconfig.json configuration?\n- Are there specific module resolution settings or compilation options I need to account for?\n- Are there established naming conventions or file organization patterns?\n\n4. Existing Codebase:\n- Are there existing types or interfaces I should extend or reference?\n- Are there shared constants or configuration files?\n- What's the established pattern for error handling and logging?\n\nCould you provide this context so I can ensure the revised code will integrate seamlessly with your environment? This will help me deliver code that:\n- Compiles cleanly with your TypeScript configuration\n- Matches your project structure and naming conventions\n- Uses consistent patterns and dependencies\n- Requires minimal manual intervention for integration"
