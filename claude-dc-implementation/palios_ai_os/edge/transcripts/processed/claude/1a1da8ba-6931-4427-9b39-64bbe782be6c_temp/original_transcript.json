    " I've reviewed the changes you've made to the `store` method, and they look correct. The key improvements include:\n\n1. Replacing `if metadata:` with `if metadata is not None:` in multiple places to properly handle None values\n2. Refactoring the TTL days handling to avoid potentially calling `.get()` on None\n3. Making all null checks consistent throughout the method\n\nThese changes should prevent the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error that was occurring during memory storage operations.\n\nYou can now proceed with restarting the server and testing. The memory service should function correctly with these changes. Let me know the results after testing, and we can address the transcript processor issues next if needed."
