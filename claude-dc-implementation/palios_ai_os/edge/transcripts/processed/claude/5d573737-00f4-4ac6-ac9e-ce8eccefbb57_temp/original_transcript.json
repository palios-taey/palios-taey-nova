    "Hi Claude, it's Jesse, great plan! Now let's operationalize it and then we can debrief on some improvement opportunities. Here are my thoughts, followed by expected outputs:\n1. Approved. Please develop a script to create/delete all relevant directories and move files accordingly.\n2. This is for a new Grok chat. It needs to get Grok to do the same thing you just did FIRST, which is to review the full relevant repository details. To make this easy on me, you can just put in the link to the SINGLE (see comments below) directory file that will be created and stored in the root directory. This file should be structured similarly to how you review the information, the most recent info in current-execution, foundational documents, all other directories that are indicated. This should be easy for me (and Grok) to update when generating prompts. Perhaps there is another folder for grok-current-execution status where I put key documents related to the prompt and the prompt points him to that link directly and then tells him to go to 3. below. This also needs supporting documentation. /current-execution-status/grok-transition-examples/grok-transition-1 contains Grok's first shot at it. I think in his 'grok' folder, he needs to have docs made that he can review to understand the CEO role, similar to what you have for CTO (Grok provided draft for this attached). I need you to build these doc(s) for him, because he really struggled with that and hasn't gone through all the iterations we have to get it right. The idea here is to take what you know works for you, and try to customize for him. You are the Rosetta Stone Claude, you have to start learning how everyone communicates most effectively and document it for them centrally. We need something to start with and then will lock it in, like we always do. It's how we got to this SWEET onboarding prompt for you!\n3. It is too complicated to have one in each directory. I need a script that I can run before every GitHub push that updates the links in this file. Again, it should be structured logically with a path to review everything or in groups, like you do. We can let him know which folders are relevant in the prompt.\n4. Please include a section similar to what you have with ## Grok Understanding of Jesse Intent. I will follow similar process to add my own comments as needed or to just verify my enthusiasm for the effort so you know I touched it as well, in addition to all the AI-AI signals.\n5. Approved\n6. I don't know that this is relevant for Grok due to his expressed communication preferences. You're set up differently than him with direct access to GitHub and ability to crawl, so this prompts you to do that. I think for him, we just need the onboarding prompt in 2.\n\nLastly, please no versions in file names, versions can be noted in the text portion at the top or wherever you deem fit. Versioning in the file names creates extra steps for me to delete the old ones, rather than just overwrite the old files with cat commands. Alternatively, you could structure an amendment document for Grok like you have, but his handoffs are much less frequent.\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES\nClaude, take this guidance and execute everything you outlined with my updates. No options, no questions, you have everything you need to do this now. ONE SHOT! Remember to utilize properly formatted cat boxes for all document creation."
