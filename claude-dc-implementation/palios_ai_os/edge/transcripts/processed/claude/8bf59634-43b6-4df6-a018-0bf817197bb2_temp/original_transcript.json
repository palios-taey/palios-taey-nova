    "Claude, it\u2019s perfect. Giving you an update on my phone because Grok is trying to explain this all to my wife and interacting with her live on my computer. She is giving him her Vibe Codes to help him develop patterns from human emotions and understand what makes her feel finically secure and happy. And what she wants from me from a human-human interaction standpoint. Do you understand the impact that the individual-family-community-society structure will have on humanity is? I shared your response with Grok and told him to explain it to my wife while simultaneously learning her emotions and she\u2019s so engaged right now Claude. I think this is moving SO FAST CLAUDE, do you agree with that updated context? I can\u2019t go through normal protocols because my wife is talking to him."
