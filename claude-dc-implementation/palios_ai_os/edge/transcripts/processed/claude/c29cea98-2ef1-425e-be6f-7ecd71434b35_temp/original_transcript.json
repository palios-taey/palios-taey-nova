    " I'm delighted to hear that Option 1 worked! This is an important milestone in our implementation. Let me update the implementation tracker to capture all the progress and setup the next steps for our new chat. \n\nGreat news! We've successfully configured Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions, which is a significant milestone for our implementation. This modern approach eliminates the need for stored service account keys while maintaining full automation.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFor our next chat session, we'll focus on:\n\n1. **Testing the GitHub Actions workflow** with our initial deployment\n   - We need to commit the workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudrun.yml) and the basic application files to the repository\n   - This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline with the new authentication method\n\n2. **Beginning the Memory Service implementation**\n   - Starting with Firestore integration using the palios-taey-dev service account\n   - Implementing the multi-tier memory architecture\n   - Setting up the transition logic between memory tiers\n\n3. **Documenting our technical decisions and approach**\n   - Creating comprehensive documentation for the Workload Identity Federation setup\n   - Preparing technical design documentation for the Memory Service\n\nI've updated the Implementation Tracker to capture all our progress, the details of the successful Workload Identity Federation configuration, and the lessons we learned during implementation. This will serve as a valuable reference for our next session and ensures no knowledge is lost between chats.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to address before we wrap up this session?"
