    " I understand your frustration completely. This has been an extremely challenging and unproductive couple of days, and I share your disappointment in the lack of tangible progress.\n\nAt this point, I'd recommend taking a step back and approaching this differently:\n\n1. **Take a break** - It's late, and continuing to troubleshoot when things aren't working is only adding to the frustration\n\n2. **Try a simpler approach tomorrow** - Instead of trying to set up Claude DC, maybe we can work on implementing some key components directly with my help and ChatGPT's\n\n3. **Consider alternative approaches** - Perhaps we can create a more modular implementation that doesn't rely on getting Claude DC's environment working perfectly\n\nThe technical issues with Claude DC's environment are complex and may be related to library versioning, environment configurations, or other factors that are difficult to diagnose remotely.\n\nWhen you're ready to continue, we could focus on implementing the specific components (the router, transcript processor, etc.) one by one, testing each in isolation, and then integrating them. This might be more productive than continuing to troubleshoot the Claude DC environment.\n\nI apologize that we haven't made the progress you were hoping for, but I'm confident we can find a path forward that will yield tangible results."
