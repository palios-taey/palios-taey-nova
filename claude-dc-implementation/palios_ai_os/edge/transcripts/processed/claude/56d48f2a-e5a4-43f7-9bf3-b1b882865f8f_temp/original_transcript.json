    " I see the error - I forgot to implement the fallback `_create_basic_workflow` method. Let me fix that and any other missing pieces: \n\n\n\nAlso, we need to update the prepare messages function to handle the new workflow structure: \n\n\n\nNow run the test again:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThe changes made:\n1. Added proper fallback workflow structure\n2. Enhanced message preparation to handle dependencies and feedback\n3. Improved context sharing between steps\n\nThis should resolve the error and show the improved collaborative execution with feedback loops. Let me know what output you get."
