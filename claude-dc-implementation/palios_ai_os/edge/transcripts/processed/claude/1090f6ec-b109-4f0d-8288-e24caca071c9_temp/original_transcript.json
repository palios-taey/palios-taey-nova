    " I see the issue now. The deployment failed because the container isn't starting properly. The error message indicates that our application isn't listening on the specified port (PORT=8080) as expected. This is typically caused by application code issues or missing dependencies.\n\nLet's fix this step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to check our main application file to ensure it's properly listening on the port:\n\n```bash\n# Make sure main.py is actually starting the Flask server on the correct port\ncat src/main.py\n```\n\nThe issue might be that our server code isn't correctly binding to the port. We need to verify that the Flask app is running on host=\"0.0.0.0\" and using the PORT environment variable.\n\nLet's update the src/main.py file to ensure it correctly binds to the port:\n\n```bash\n# Check if this section exists at the bottom of the main.py file\n# If not, add it or update it\ncat >> src/main.py << 'EOF'\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    port = int(os.environ.get(\"PORT\", 8080))\n    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=port, debug=False)\nEOF\n```\n\n2. Let's also check if all the required modules are being imported in the file:\n\n```bash\n# Check what imports are in main.py\ngrep -n \"import\" src/main.py\n```\n\nIf you're using the original server.py from the previous chat, it may be trying to import modules that are defined in separate files. We need to make sure all these files are present in the src directory.\n\n3. Let's verify the requirements.txt file has all necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncat requirements.txt\n```\n\nMake sure it includes at minimum:\n- flask\n- firebase-admin (if you're using Firestore)\n- google-cloud-firestore\n- Any other libraries your app needs\n\n4. Let's simplify our application to just get something running. Create a new, simpler main.py file that just implements a basic health check:\n\n```bash\ncat > src/main.py << 'EOF'\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\n\n# Initialize Flask app\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef home():\n    \"\"\"Root endpoint for health checks\"\"\"\n    return jsonify({\n        \"status\": \"healthy\",\n        \"system\": \"PALIOS-TAEY\",\n        \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n    })\n\n@app.route('/api/health', methods=['GET'])\ndef health_check():\n    \"\"\"Health check endpoint\"\"\"\n    return jsonify({\n        \"status\": \"healthy\",\n        \"components\": {\n            \"core\": \"healthy\"\n        }\n    })\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    port = int(os.environ.get(\"PORT\", 8080))\n    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=port, debug=False)\nEOF\n```\n\n5. Commit and push these changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add src/main.py requirements.txt\ngit commit -m \"Fix application startup and port binding\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis simplifies our application to the bare minimum to get it running on Cloud Run. Once we have the basic deployment working, we can incrementally add back the more complex functionality.\n\nLet's see if this resolves the container startup issue."
