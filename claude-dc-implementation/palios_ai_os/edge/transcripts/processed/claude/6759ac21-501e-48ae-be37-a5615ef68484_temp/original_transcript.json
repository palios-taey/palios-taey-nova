    " It looks like the service is responding with \"Service Unavailable\". This indicates that while the deployment has completed, there might be an issue with the application starting properly. \n\nLet's troubleshoot this:\n\n1. **Check Deployment Logs**:\n   - Go to Google Cloud Console\n   - Navigate to Cloud Run\n   - Select your \"palios-taey-core\" service\n   - Click on \"Logs\" tab\n   - Look for errors in the startup sequence\n\n2. **Common Startup Issues**:\n   - Missing dependencies in requirements.txt\n   - Errors in the main application code\n   - Configuration issues with environment variables\n   - Permission issues with accessing Google Cloud services\n\n3. **Check Container Build**:\n   - In the GitHub Actions logs, check if the container built successfully\n   - Verify that all necessary files were included in the build\n\n4. **Quick Fix Suggestions**:\n   - Ensure your Dockerfile has the correct entry point and working directory\n   - Verify that the main.py file is in the correct location (src/main.py)\n   - Check that all dependencies are properly installed\n\n5. **Inspect Recent Changes**:\n   - Review any changes made to main.py or the Dockerfile in the latest push\n   - Look for syntax errors or import issues\n\nThe most common issue would be missing dependencies or incorrect file paths. Let's verify the content of your requirements.txt to ensure all necessary packages are included:\n\n```\nflask==2.2.3\nwerkzeug==2.2.3\nflask-cors==3.0.10\ngunicorn==20.1.0\ngoogle-cloud-firestore==2.10.0\ngoogle-cloud-storage==2.10.0\nfirebase-admin==6.2.0\nrequests==2.28.2\npython-dotenv==1.0.0\ngoogle-auth==2.17.3\npyyaml==6.0\n```\n\nAlso, check your Dockerfile to ensure it's setting up the environment correctly:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the application files\nCOPY src/ /app/\n\n# Create necessary directories\nRUN mkdir -p logs config/model_capabilities config/decomposition_rules data\n\n# Expose the port for the application\nEXPOSE 8080\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PORT=8080\n\n# Run the application with Gunicorn instead of the Flask development server\nCMD exec gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app\n```\n\nOnce we identify the issue from the logs, we can make the necessary changes and redeploy."
