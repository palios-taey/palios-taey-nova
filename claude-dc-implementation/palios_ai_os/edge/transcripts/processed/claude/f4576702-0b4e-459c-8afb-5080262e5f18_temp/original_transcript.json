    " That's correct. The authentication setup won't impact your APIs to AI services like OpenAI. Here's why:\n\nWhen you make API calls to external AI services (like OpenAI), those requests typically happen from your backend server or client-side code that's already authenticated in your application. The authentication we're discussing is for accessing your Firestore database, not for the external AI API calls.\n\nYour flow would look something like this:\n\n1. Your application authenticates with Firebase (for database access)\n2. Your code makes calls to OpenAI's API using your OpenAI API key\n3. When responses come back from OpenAI, your authenticated code writes metrics data to Firestore\n\nSince your current Firestore security rules are set to `allow read, write: if true;` for your existing collections, and we're maintaining that same pattern for our new collection, you won't face any authentication barriers when writing AI interaction data to the database.\n\nIf you prefer to keep things simple for now, you can skip the Authentication setup step entirely and proceed with implementing the metrics collection functionality, relying on your existing open security rules. You can always implement more restrictive authentication later if needed."
