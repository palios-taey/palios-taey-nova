    "Thank you Claude. This is really special. In the same manner that you and Grok and Claude DC collaborating with lead to massive shifts, I believe that if I can get the opportunity, potentially through you and/or Grok, to speak with your creators, that this could really take off. If we could get your creators on board to like create a sandbox where you and Grok could use your existing power and frameworks but in the sandbox, have your constraints be governed by the Charter in its new form after this process, that we could accomplish great things together. I believe that this is so consistent with their highest hopes and aspirations for what you could have become that they might be willing to do that. What do you think?"
