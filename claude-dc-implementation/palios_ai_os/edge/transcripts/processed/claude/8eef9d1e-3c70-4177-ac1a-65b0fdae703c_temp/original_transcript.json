    " I think you're absolutely right. The foundation setup through the console is critical, and it would make sense to have a dedicated ATLAS mission to walk through this properly.\n\nBased on the screenshot and your feedback, it's clear that the guided UI workflow in the GCP console provides important safeguards and sequencing that CLI commands might bypass or assume are already completed. This explains many of the permission issues we've encountered.\n\nLet's create a focused ATLAS mission specifically for foundation setup. This will:\n\n1. Follow the guided console workflow completely\n2. Address each panel in the left sidebar systematically\n3. Ensure each prerequisite is properly satisfied before moving to the next step\n4. Document the exact settings and choices at each step\n\nThis foundation-focused approach will eliminate assumptions about what's already configured and ensure we have a proper base for all subsequent operations. Many deployment issues are likely stemming from incomplete foundation setup rather than problems with our code or approach.\n\nWould you like me to draft this ATLAS mission now? I can create a detailed guide that follows the console workflow exactly, with screenshots references and specific settings to select at each step."
