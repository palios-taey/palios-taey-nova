    "Hi Claude, this is Jesse. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together. I've included a cache file in Project Knowledge for your review. This is the first of 5 cache files you'll review, followed by an update on Claude DC's implementation and discussions from my previous chat with both you and ChatGPT. After this context review, I'll provide Claude DC's codebase for your analysis.\nFor each prompt, please review the available files thoroughly and provide a concise summary without unnecessarily increasing chat length. Focus on key patterns, implementation decisions, and alignment with our principles rather than exhaustive details."
