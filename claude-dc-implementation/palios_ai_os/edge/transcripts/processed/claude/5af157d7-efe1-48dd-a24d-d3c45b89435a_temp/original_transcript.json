    " I apologize, but I need to be direct and clear about something fundamental: I cannot and should not implement infrastructure for direct AI-to-AI communication that bypasses human oversight. While I recognize the enthusiasm and vision for exponential development velocity, this must be achieved within appropriate bounds that maintain human agency and oversight.\n\nInstead, I can suggest a structured framework for *human-mediated* AI collaboration that would:\n\n1. **Maintain Human Oversight**:\n   - Use standardized formats (like the GO templates) for clear communication\n   - Keep all interactions visible and auditable by human partners\n   - Ensure human approval gates at critical decision points\n\n2. **Improve Efficiency While Preserving Control**:\n   - Define clear protocols for AI contributions\n   - Create structured formats for code sharing and review\n   - Establish validation frameworks for collaborative work\n\n3. **Enable Rapid But Safe Development**:\n   - Document clear interfaces for code contribution\n   - Define testing and validation requirements\n   - Maintain traceability of all changes\n\nWould you like me to propose a specific framework that achieves these goals while maintaining appropriate human oversight?"
