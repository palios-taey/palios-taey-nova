    "So we need to actually process all the transcripts now right? And then you can do the live-demonstration(I've updated Project knowledge with your plans for that, less the Bach recordings, which have already been transfered). Is there anything I need to do right now with moving things to my machine? Or Claude DC needing to push anything? Is everything in GCS ready? Let me know what you want my next prompt for him to be to complete everything and then you guys can run with it again. I think everything is laid out, so I would just need to be brought back in when ready for the demo, assuming everything goes well, which since your orchestrating, I assume all will go smoothly as it has so far, just as we have planned."
