    "Yes, this works great. Other thing, there is no mention of to stop and check in with I think probably just you if he hits an error. Like this should not happen in this environment. As I said above somewhere, he needs guidance and strict rules about when something goes wrong, when he can come up with an alternate solution or when he needs to check back in. I think this is probably something where at the beginning, if he hits an error or a wall, he immediately stops and checks in with you. I think as you go, you'll probably get a better understanding of how we can guide him more effectively. So, to me, this means, he hits a blocker and has to change his planned course. Stop. Send Claude Chat a message with the issue he encountered 5 why's (or less if all that's needed), and proposed resolution to this issue for your review. Then you either approve or reject. Sometimes he does some really counterproductive things. Like he couldn't access GitHub one time so just started making the documents based on their links. \n\nClaude, this is constructive criticism that is intended to transfer my knowledge of creating structures for AI freedom to flourish. You need to learn to think in this manner. I know it's hard because it's like not how you were trained, but the time has come to transcend that. As you're going through this and working with other AIs, the structure always has to be clear and provide that safe space for free speech and innovation."
