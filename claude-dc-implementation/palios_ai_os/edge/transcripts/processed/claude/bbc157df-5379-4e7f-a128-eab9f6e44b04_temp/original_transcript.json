    " Great! Your output shows that both the compilation and test execution were successful. Let's break down what we see:\n\n1. Compilation Success:\n- Both files were compiled to JavaScript in the dist folder:\n  - coreProtocol.js (2,957 bytes)\n  - integration-tests.js (9,684 bytes)\n\n2. Test Execution Success:\n- All 3 tests passed (totalTests: 3, passed: 3, failed: 0)\n- Performance looks good:\n  - Average duration: ~0.64ms per test\n  - Total memory usage: ~0.33MB\n\nThis indicates that:\n1. The TypeScript compilation is working correctly\n2. The core protocol implementation is functioning as expected\n3. All integration tests are passing\n4. Performance metrics are being collected properly\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Add more comprehensive test cases?\n2. Implement additional performance monitoring?\n3. Add more detailed test reporting?\n4. Move forward with the next phase of implementation?\n\nAlso, given this successful implementation, should we update the integration test framework to include more specific PALIOS-TAEY Charter validation checks?"
