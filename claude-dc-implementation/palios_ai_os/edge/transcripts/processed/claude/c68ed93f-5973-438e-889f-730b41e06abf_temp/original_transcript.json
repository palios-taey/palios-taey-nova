    "Ok, I need to clear out the current Cloud Run first, so will do that.\nHas all code been tested? If not, can you? \nCan you also make ongoing recommendations for root directory structure, subfolders, that gets transitioned with the expectation to guide me on this? Currently, all the code files are in the root directory. \nFinally, documentation/artifacts that should be kept for future reference (according to AI first methodology of course) should also be referenced with where it should be stored. If not, that's fine too. This is our 2nd time through this, so want to make sure we're covering all aspects for an AI led development of the platform."
