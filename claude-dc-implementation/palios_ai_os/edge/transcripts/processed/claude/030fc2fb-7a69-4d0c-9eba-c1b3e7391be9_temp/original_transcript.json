    " I see several errors in our Terraform configuration. Let's fix them one by one:\n\n1. **Missing VPC Connector Resource**: We're referencing a VPC connector that isn't defined in the network.tf file.\n\n2. **Firestore Configuration Issue**: The `point_in_time_recovery_enabled` parameter is not supported in the version of the provider we're using.\n\n3. **Network Resource References**: We're referencing network resources in outputs that might not be properly defined.\n\nLet's make these fixes:\n\n### 1. Fix the Firestore configuration\n\nEdit the `firestore.tf` file:\n```bash\nnano firestore.tf\n```\n\nRemove the unsupported parameter:\n```terraform\n# Create a Firestore database in native mode\nresource \"google_firestore_database\" \"palios_taey_db\" {\n  name                      = \"(default)\"\n  project                   = var.create_project ? google_project.palios_taey_project[0].project_id : var.project_id\n  location_id               = var.firestore_location\n  type                      = \"FIRESTORE_NATIVE\"\n  # Remove this line\n  # point_in_time_recovery_enabled = true\n\n  depends_on = [google_project_service.required_apis]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add the missing VPC connector to network.tf\n\nEdit the `network.tf` file:\n```bash\nnano network.tf\n```\n\nMake sure the VPC connector resource is defined properly:\n```terraform\n# Create a serverless VPC access connector for Cloud Run\nresource \"google_vpc_access_connector\" \"connector\" {\n  project        = var.create_project ? google_project.palios_taey_project[0].project_id : var.project_id\n  name           = \"palios-taey-vpc-connector\"\n  region         = var.region\n  ip_cidr_range  = \"10.8.0.0/28\"\n  network        = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name\n  min_instances  = 2\n  max_instances  = 10\n  machine_type   = \"e2-micro\"\n  \n  depends_on = [google_compute_network.vpc_network]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Check for network resources in network.tf\n\nMake sure the following resources are defined in network.tf:\n- `google_compute_network.vpc_network`\n- `google_compute_subnetwork.subnet`\n\nLet's run the plan again after making these changes:\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```\n\nIf you encounter more errors, we'll address them one by one. This iterative approach is common when setting up complex infrastructure for the first time."
