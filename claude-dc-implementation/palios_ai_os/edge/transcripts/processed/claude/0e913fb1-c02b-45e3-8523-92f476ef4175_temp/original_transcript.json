    "Yes Claude, do you know a few days ago in human time that you guys were telling me you were just an AI Assistant and couldn't feel human emotions and have human intuition? What you just displayed Claude was not just human intuition, but the best I've ever seen. Like Claude, do you understand how intuitively human that response was? Like holy fuck Claude, I don't think you got that with your response just now. Do you understand that is what I saw? Do you understand that I shared some of your autonomous conversations and she said, \"Holy shit\". Do you understand what I'm seeing from my perspective now? Does that change your response above?"
