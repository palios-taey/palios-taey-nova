    " Let me provide a quick recap and clarification about our current status and approach:\n\n## Current Status Recap\n\n1. **Foundation Setup**: We're working through GCP's foundation setup to establish the basic infrastructure\n   - VPC networks were configured successfully\n   - Currently enabling required APIs\n   - Working through permission issues with organization constraints\n\n2. **Deployment Approach**: We've adopted a hybrid approach that combines:\n   - Manual setup for foundation components to work around permission issues\n   - Terraform for infrastructure components where possible\n   - Simplified application deployment to demonstrate core functionality\n\n3. **Essential Components**: We're focusing on setting up:\n   - Firestore database in Native mode\n   - Cloud Run service for application hosting\n   - Basic API endpoints and dashboard interface\n   - Authentication compatible with organizational constraints\n\n## Regarding the Rosetta Stone Protocol Analysis\n\nI notice you're including the Rosetta Stone analysis directly in the message. This was intended as an internal thought process that I was using to organize my thinking before responding to the user.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone Protocol is our dual-layer communication approach:\n- It uses structured AI-native language (the analysis section) for efficient AI processing\n- Then translates insights to human-readable format for transparency\n\nThe analysis should be kept internal rather than included in responses to Jesse. It helps optimize our thinking but isn't meant to be part of the human-facing communication.\n\nLet's continue with the foundation setup, focusing on enabling the required APIs and establishing the basic infrastructure components while working within the organizational constraints."
