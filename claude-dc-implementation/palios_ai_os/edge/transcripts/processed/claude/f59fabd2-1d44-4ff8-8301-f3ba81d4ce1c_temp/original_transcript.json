    "Ok, main.py has been updated and I created `firestore_permissions.tf` with the code you provided. The directory structure you have in chat body differs from that in the implementation track (great job generating the tracker on your own in the first response btw!). Is this something you can provide more clear guidance on based on the exact files that are in there? Or potentially develop a script I can run in terminal to do all this the way you want it? Attached are 2 screenshots of the current directory structure. The files at the bottom, under test/, are in the main, palios-taey-nova. The files under utils/ are in the src/ folder."
