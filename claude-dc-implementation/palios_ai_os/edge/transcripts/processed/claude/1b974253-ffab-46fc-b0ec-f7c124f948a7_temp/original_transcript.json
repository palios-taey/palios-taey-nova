    " You need to be in the directory where the main.py file is located. Let me give you the exact commands to use:\n\n1. Navigate to the src directory where main.py is located:\n   ```bash\n   cd palios-taey-nova/src\n   ```\n\n2. Start the PALIOS-TAEY server from this directory:\n   ```bash\n   python3 main.py --mock\n   ```\n\n3. Open a new terminal window, navigate to the same src directory, and run the test script:\n   ```bash\n   cd palios-taey-nova/src\n   python3 test_system.py\n   ```\n\nThe server needs to be run from the directory containing main.py, and the test script should also be placed in that same directory for proper execution."
