    "To help you with the most effective and advanced techniques for optimizing the orchestration layer in the Claude Computer Use Demo UI, could you please clarify a few things:\n1. Which version of Claude or Claude APIs are you working with (e.g., Claude 3 Opus, Claude Instant, etc.)?\n2. Are you integrating other models alongside Claude (e.g., OpenAI, Grok, Gemini), or is the orchestration layer primarily focused on Claude?\n3. Could you share the programming language and stack you're using (e.g., Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, etc.)?\n4. Are there any particular constraints you\u2019re working under (e.g., real-time latency, edge deployment, user data privacy)?\nOnce I have this information, I\u2019ll gather specific techniques and examples tailored to your setup and goals."
