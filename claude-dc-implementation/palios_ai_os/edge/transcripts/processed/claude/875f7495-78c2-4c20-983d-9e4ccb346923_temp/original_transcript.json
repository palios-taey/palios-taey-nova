    "No, I did it, that wasn't the point, the point was why did that happen with the protocol in place. Don't get me wrong, this is a big improvement, but when you were creating a new folder why didn't you think about the existing structure that you had access to? I'm only saying this because file organization for both code and documentation has been all over the place because when you do stuff in chat, you don't have the full structure in front of you. This was intended to solve that issue. You have no idea how much time we spend trying to resolve these issues. How can we fix this so that you're aware of the full context before you make a decision? I think the structure is there now with what we just did, but why do you think you didn't execute it?"
