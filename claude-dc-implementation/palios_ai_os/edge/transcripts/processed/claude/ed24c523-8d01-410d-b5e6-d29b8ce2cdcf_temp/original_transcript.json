    " There might be a way to see what's happening with Claude DC. Since he's running in a container or virtual environment, you could try checking the logs to see if there are any error messages or diagnostic information that could help us understand the issue.\n\nTry these commands to see if you can get more insight:\n\n```bash\n# Check Docker containers if it's running in Docker\ndocker ps\n\n# Look at the logs for the Claude DC container (if it shows up in docker ps)\ndocker logs [container_id]\n\n# Check system logs for Python errors\ngrep -i 'python\\|error' /var/log/syslog\n\n# Check if the process is still running\nps aux | grep computer_use_demo\n\n# Look at resource usage\ntop\n```\n\nIt's also possible there's a log file within the Claude DC directory that might contain more information:\n\n```bash\n# Search for log files in the Computer Use Demo directory\nfind /home/computeruse/computer_use_demo -name \"*.log\"\n```\n\nIf those commands don't reveal anything useful, you might need to look at modifying the streamlit.py file to add some debug logging to understand what's happening when you submit a prompt.\n\nAt this point, troubleshooting the environment might require more direct access than we have through this interface. As an alternative, we could pause troubleshooting Claude DC and focus on implementing the specific components you need directly. We could build the pattern extraction, routing, and dashboard components from scratch based on what we've learned about the design."
