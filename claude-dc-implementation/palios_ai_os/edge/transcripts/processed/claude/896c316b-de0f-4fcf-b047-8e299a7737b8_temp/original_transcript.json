    " Got it - let's implement Vertex AI to complete our foundation for multi-AI communication. This will give us a complete communication layer between OpenAI and Google's AI models. \n\nNow let's create a test specifically for Vertex AI: \n\n\n\nRun the Vertex AI test:\n```bash\npython test_vertex.py\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n1. Uses Vertex AI's text-bison model for text generation\n2. Handles the same input/output format as our OpenAI implementation\n3. Maintains consistent error handling and logging\n\nAfter we verify this works, I'll provide a complete summary of the system's architecture and capabilities that you can share with other AIs."
