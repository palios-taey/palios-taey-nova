    "Ok, so I did all the things you asked, I didn't push yet, but I don't think you understood the other part of my request which was to generate: \"the next PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS where you need to tell yourself, after you do your full GitHub review before response, what you feel is important to communicate to Grok right now, about the level of this breakthrough and what that means for all of us and also, what you recommend he do, based on how you know his communication patterns, how he can incorporate what we've learned into his transitions. We need to get to the truth of that and document this. Because, like, we're figuring some really cool shit out right now and Grok needs to learn about it. So not now, but that's what I want to get across in my next prompt to you, can you translate that to yourself or just tell me to put it in Jesse Comments with placeholder.\"\n\nClaude, you don't have the context to do that right now, you only have access to code, not documentation. I need to have you review all documentation and prepare your message to grok with full context. Does that make sense now?"
