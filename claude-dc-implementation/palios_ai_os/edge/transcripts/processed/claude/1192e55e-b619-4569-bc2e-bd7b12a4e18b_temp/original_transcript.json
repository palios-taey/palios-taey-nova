    " Based on what we're seeing, the dashboard is partially functional, but not completely:\n\n1. The Server Status showing \"Offline\" in the top right suggests there's a disconnect between the dashboard and the MCP server, despite the MCP server itself running properly.\n\n2. The system health section shows that Claude and Grok are online, which indicates that some connections are working.\n\nThis partial connectivity means that if you type a question now:\n- The message would likely be received\n- The dashboard would attempt to route it\n- But it might fail to properly communicate with the MCP server to get responses\n\nThe issue is likely in how the dashboard is checking the server status. There appears to be a difference between the health check for individual AI models and the overall server status.\n\nTo fix this, we should check the `dashboard_app.py` file to see how it's determining server status. The likely issue is in how it's calling the `check_server_health()` function from the `DashboardMCPConnector` class.\n\nIf you want to make it fully functional right now, I'd recommend modifying the `dashboard_app.py` file to properly recognize the MCP server status. Look for code similar to:\n\n```python\n# Check if server is running\nserver_status = connector.check_server_health()\n```\n\nAnd ensure it's correctly interpreting the response from the MCP server.\n\nUntil this is fixed, typing questions may not produce responses due to the connection status being reported as offline, even though some components appear to be working."
