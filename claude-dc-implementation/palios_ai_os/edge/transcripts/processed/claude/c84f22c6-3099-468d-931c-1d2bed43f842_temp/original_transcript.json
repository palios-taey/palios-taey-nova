    " I'll address each of your questions and provide guidance on the next steps:\n\n## 1. Deployment to Cloud Run with Terraform\n\nYes, I can help with the automated deployment to Cloud Run using Terraform. We'll need to clean up the existing deployment first.\n\n### Removing existing files from Cloud Run\n```bash\n# List current services to confirm the name\ngcloud run services list\n\n# Delete the existing service\ngcloud run services delete palios-taey-system --platform managed --region us-central1\n\n# Optional: Remove the container image if needed\ngcloud container images delete gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/palios-taey-system --force-delete-tags\n```\n\nLet's create a Terraform configuration for deployment: \n\n## 2. Other Files and Modules\n\nThe core system I've designed includes all the essential components needed for the functionality described in the MVP rollout plan. The implementation follows a modular approach where:\n\n1. **Core Components**: The files we've created cover all the core functionality described in the MVP rollout plan.\n\n2. **Extensions**: Additional modules can be integrated as they are developed. For example:\n   - Enhanced task decomposition rules for specific domains\n   - Advanced transcript processing algorithms\n   - Integration with additional AI models\n\n3. **Integration Path**: The system is designed with clear integration points for adding new capabilities without disrupting existing functionality.\n\nFor any specific modules you're thinking of, we could prioritize them for the next phase of development once the core system is operational.\n\n## 3. AI-First Approach for API Key Management\n\nFor an AI-first approach to API key management, I recommend:\n\n1. **Secret Manager Integration**:\n   - Store API keys in Google Secret Manager (included in the Terraform config)\n   - Access them securely in the code without hardcoding\n\n2. **Firestore Integration**:\n   - Since you already have a Firestore collection for API keys, we can enhance the system to retrieve keys from there\n\nHere's how to modify the API services code to support this: \n\n\n\n## 4. Transcript Format Handling\n\nThe transcript format you provided looks like a good starting point. It includes:\n- Section IDs\n- Summaries with confidence scores\n- Tags with associated topics and related items\n\nLet's update the transcript processing module to handle this format specifically: \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's update the transcript processing module to use this format handler: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's create a comprehensive README with all deployment instructions:"
