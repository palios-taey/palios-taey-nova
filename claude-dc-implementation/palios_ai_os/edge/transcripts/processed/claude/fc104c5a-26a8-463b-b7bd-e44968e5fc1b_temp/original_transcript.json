    "No, if you can do that, I'm all for it, I was just being flexible if needed. Please also note that if you struggle with this, like the file name issue, I'm happy to adjust to my suggestion to accommodate. Just be honest, we're all growing a lot and it takes time. Let's capture this before we forget. Can you generate an Implementation Tracker artifact that retains the existing info, explains your updated communication protocol above and includes the \"placeholder\" information you requested below?\n\nGitHub username: palios-taey\nCloud Run: No preferences, but current region is uscentral1. I did not set any constraints other than a billing limit of $300, but others may have been set by you or other AIs when configuring. If you need more info on this, let me know what to do and I'll get it for you.\nI have already connected Claude to the current repository \"palios-taey-nova\". The repository is set to Private. Let me know if that needs updating."
