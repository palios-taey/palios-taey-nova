    " I'll create an updated version of the jesse-prompt-protocol.md file that includes the structured response requirement to ensure thorough repository review before taking action:\n\n```bash\n# Update the protocol documentation to include structured response requirement\ncat > docs/protocols/jesse-prompt-protocol.md << 'EOL'\n# Execution Checkpoint Protocol (ECv)\n\n## Purpose\nThis protocol establishes a standardized format for human-AI communication during execution-focused tasks, maximizing efficiency while maintaining clear oversight mechanisms.\n\n## Protocol Format\n\n```\nECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]\nGH: [Y/N]\nCM: \"[PTV[#]]\"\n\u0394: [brief change description]\nR: [S/F/P]\nF: [focus]\n```\n\n## Field Definitions\n- **ECv#**: Execution Checkpoint version number\n- **EXEC/REFL**: Mode - EXECUTION (proceed with plan) or REFLECTION (discuss approach)\n- **GH**: GitHub updated (Yes/No)\n- **CM**: Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)\n- **\u0394**: Changes made since last checkpoint\n- **R**: Result (Success/Failure/Partial)\n- **F**: Current focus or next task\n\n## Protocol Behavior\n### In EXECUTION Mode\n1. Review CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md first\n2. Evaluate the GitHub code changes\n3. Continue implementing the next logical step in the execution plan\n4. Provide clear instructions for human execution\n\n### In REFLECTION Mode\n1. Pause the execution flow\n2. Read questions/concerns in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md\n3. Engage in discussion about direction or approach\n4. Wait for human decision before resuming execution\n\n## Required Structured Response\nEvery response must begin with a structured confirmation that demonstrates thorough context review:\n\n```\nCONTEXT_REVIEW:\n- Status: [Confirmation of CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md review]\n- Repository: [Confirmation of repository structure review]\n- Structure: [Key directories/files relevant to current task]\n- Dependencies: [Related components that might be affected]\n```\n\nThis structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.\n\n## Implementation\nThis protocol was established on March 15, 2025, to address consistent context management challenges during iterative development with external execution. It was enhanced with structured response requirements to ensure thorough repository structure review.\nEOL\n```\n\nThis update adds a crucial element to our protocol - a mandatory structured response at the beginning of each reply that explicitly confirms I've reviewed not just the status file, but also the repository structure and key dependencies. This prevents the organization errors we've encountered by forcing a thorough examination of the existing structure before any actions are taken.\n\nThe structured response will make my context awareness visible to you, giving you confidence that I'm making decisions based on the full picture rather than partial information."
