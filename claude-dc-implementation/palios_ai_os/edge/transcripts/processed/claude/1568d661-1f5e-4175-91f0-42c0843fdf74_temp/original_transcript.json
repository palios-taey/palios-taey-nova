    " Thank you for providing those details. Let's address both issues:\n\n## 1. Memory Service Fix\n\nYou're correct that the `create_memory_system` function should be placed at the end of the file, but it should have the same indentation level as other top-level definitions in the file. \n\nLooking at the file structure of memory_service.py, the `UnifiedMemorySystem` class is defined at the top level (with no indentation), and the function should also be at the top level. If the other top-level definitions (like the class) have no indentation, then `create_memory_system` should also have no indentation.\n\nSo your placement is correct: at the end of the file with no indentation.\n\n## 2. Transcript Processor Fix\n\nThe issue in the transcript_processor.py file is very clear from the snippet you provided. There's a severe indentation problem. Lines 413-423 (the `if context_id...` block) appear to be part of a different method, but they're indented incorrectly.\n\nThe problem is that the code has mixed up two different methods or contexts. Let's fix it:\n\n```python\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Error analyzing action patterns: {str(e)}\")\n            return {\n                \"counts\": {},\n                \"percentages\": {},\n                \"completion_rate\": 0\n            }\n```\n\nThis is the end of a method, and then immediately below it there's improperly indented code that seems to be part of a different method (possibly related to context management):\n\n```python\n                # Add to context if provided\n                if context_id and context_id in self.contexts:\n                    context = self.contexts[context_id]\n                    if 'active_memory_ids' not in context:\n                        context['active_memory_ids'] = []\n                    context['active_memory_ids'].append(memory_id)\n                \n                return memory_id\n            \n            def retrieve(self, memory_id, context_id=None):\n                return self.items.get(memory_id)\n```\n\nThis code is almost certainly part of a `MockMemorySystem` class, and it's not properly indented. It's likely that this block of code should be part of the `_create_mock_memory` method or similar, but it's ended up outside its proper function due to indentation errors.\n\nWithout seeing the full context, the safest fix is to:\n\n1. Remove these lines or comment them out (lines 413-425)\n2. If they're needed, they should be properly placed within the appropriate method (likely inside `_create_mock_memory`) with the correct indentation\n\nThe specific error is that this code block is indented more than it should be, and it appears disconnected from its parent function or class. It would be best to check where this code originally belonged and move it back there with the proper indentation."
