    " I'll examine the updated transcript_processor.py file to identify any remaining indentation issues. Let me analyze the file carefully to provide specific code blocks for any sections that still need to be fixed.\n\nAfter reviewing the updated file, I can see there are still a few indentation issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. Around line 1650: There appears to be an issue with the `_get_message_summary` method. This is likely the source of the \"unexpected unindent\" error mentioned in the logs.\n\n2. There's a large block of commented-out code near the end of the file that may be causing issues.\n\nHere are the specific fixes needed:\n\n## Fix for _get_message_summary method\n\nThe `_get_message_summary` method is likely improperly indented. It should be at the same indentation level as other methods in the TranscriptProcessor class. Here's how it should look:\n\n```python\ndef _get_message_summary(self, message: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a summary for a message\n    \n    Args:\n        message: Message data\n        \n    Returns:\n        Summary text\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use existing summary if available\n        if \"summary\" in message.get(\"metadata\", {}):\n            return message[\"metadata\"][\"summary\"]\n        \n        # Extract content\n        content = message.get(\"content\", \"\")\n        \n        # Generate a basic summary\n        if isinstance(content, str):\n            # For text content\n            if len(content) > 100:\n                return content[:97] + \"...\"\n            return content\n        elif isinstance(content, dict):\n            # For structured content\n            return f\"Structured content with {len(content)} fields\"\n        else:\n            return \"Message content\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error generating message summary: {str(e)}\")\n        return \"Message content\"\n```\n\n## Fix for stray code and comments\n\nThere may be some stray code or comments at the end of the file that need to be properly indented or removed. Look for any code blocks like this:\n\n```python\n# This appears to be misplaced code that should be removed or properly indented\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logger.error(f\"Error retrieving transcript {transcript_id}: {str(e)}\")\n    \n    # Check mock storage as fallback\n    if self.use_mock and hasattr(self, '_transcripts') and transcript_id in self._transcripts:\n        return self._transcripts[transcript_id]\n    \n    return None\n```\n\nIf this is at the end of a method, make sure it's properly indented within that method. If it's orphaned code, it should be removed or properly placed within a method.\n\nThese fixes should address the remaining indentation issues. Let me know if you'd like more specific guidance on any particular section!"
