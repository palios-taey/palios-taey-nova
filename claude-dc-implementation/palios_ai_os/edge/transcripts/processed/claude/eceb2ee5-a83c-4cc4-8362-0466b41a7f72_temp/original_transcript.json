    " Ah, we also need to save the `aiThoughtProcessor.ts` file. Let's do this step by step:\n\n1. Create the files:\n```bash\n# First, remove old files\nrm aiCommunication.ts aiCommunicationTest.ts\n\n# Create new files with the content I provided\n# Save aiThoughtProcessor.ts\n# Save aiThoughtProcessorTest.ts\n```\n\n2. Verify the files exist:\n```bash\ndir *.ts\n```\n\n3. Then build:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nCould you confirm that both `aiThoughtProcessor.ts` and `aiThoughtProcessorTest.ts` are saved in the correct directory? Once both files are in place, the import error should resolve."
