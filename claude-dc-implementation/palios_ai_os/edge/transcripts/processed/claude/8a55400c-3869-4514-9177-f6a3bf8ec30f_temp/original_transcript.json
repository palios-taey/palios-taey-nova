    " Let's fix the Workload Identity Federation issue and get a win in this session. The key issue we're seeing is the audience mismatch in the token. Let's approach this systematically:\n\n## Technical Direction for Fixing Workload Identity Federation\n\nThe error message suggests there's a mismatch between the token audience and the expected audience. This typically happens when the provider configuration isn't exactly matching between GitHub Actions and GCP.\n\nHere's what we need to do:\n\n1. First, let's get the exact details of the current Workload Identity Pool and Provider from GCP\n2. Update our GitHub Actions workflow with the precise configuration\n3. Make a small test commit to verify it works\n\n### Step 1: Verify GCP Workload Identity Configuration\n\nRun this command to get the exact provider details:\n\n```bash\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers describe github-provider \\\n  --location=global \\\n  --workload-identity-pool=github-actions-pool \\\n  --format=json\n```\n\nThis will give us the exact format and audience configuration.\n\n### Step 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow\n\nBased on the error message, I suspect the issue might be related to the format of the provider string. Let's create an updated workflow file with modifications to fix the audience issue: \n\nI noticed a potential issue with the audience configuration. Let me create an alternative version that uses a different approach based on GitHub's documentation: \n\n\n\nLet's also create a minimal test workflow that only tests the authentication step - this will help us isolate the issue: \n\n\n\nNow, let's check the service account binding to ensure it's correctly set up: \n\n\n\n## Ready for Execution\n\nBased on our analysis, I believe we have a few issues with the Workload Identity Federation configuration:\n\n1. The service account binding might not be using the correct principal format\n2. The workflow configuration might have an incorrect provider string format\n3. We may need to simplify our authentication approach\n\nLet's take these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n### 1. First, verify the service account binding\n\nSave the `verify-sa-binding.sh` script to your local machine and make it executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x verify-sa-binding.sh\n./verify-sa-binding.sh\n```\n\nThis will show us the current configuration and attempt to add the correct bindings.\n\n### 2. Try the test authentication workflow\n\nSave the `test-auth-workflow.yml` to `.github/workflows/test-auth.yml` and push it:\n\n```bash\ngit add .github/workflows/test-auth.yml\ngit commit -m \"Add test authentication workflow\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThen go to GitHub Actions tab in your repository and manually run the \"Test Authentication\" workflow to see if it succeeds.\n\n### 3. Update the main workflow\n\nIf the test workflow succeeds, update the main deployment workflow with the `github-workflow-alternative.yml` content:\n\n```bash\n# Replace the content of the deploy.yml file\ncp .github/workflows/deploy.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml.bak\n# Then copy the new content to deploy.yml\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml\ngit commit -m \"Update deployment workflow with simplified authentication\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis approach will help us isolate and fix the authentication issue step by step. The key insight is that we need to ensure the service account binding uses the correct principal format, and that we simplify our workflow configuration to use the default settings for authentication.\n\nLet me know which step you'd like to start with, and I'll provide any additional guidance needed."
