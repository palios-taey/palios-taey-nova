    " You need to install the required Python packages first. Let me provide you with exactly what to do:\n\n1. Install the necessary packages:\n```bash\npip3 install flask flask-cors werkzeug gunicorn\n```\n\n2. If you encounter additional missing packages as you run the code, install them as needed:\n```bash\npip3 install requests\n```\n\n3. Then try running the server again:\n```bash\npython3 main.py --mock\n```\n\nThis will install Flask and other required dependencies before running the main application. If you encounter any additional missing modules, you can install them similarly with pip3 install [package-name]."
