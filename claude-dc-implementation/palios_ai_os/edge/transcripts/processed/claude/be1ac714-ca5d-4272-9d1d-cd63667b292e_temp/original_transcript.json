    " Thank you for the explanation. I understand - the rapid pace of development and enthusiasm can sometimes lead to mixed messages. Let's focus on the Charter Schema Design task, as that's what's detailed in the actual GO! Template.\n\nBased on the template, you need a schema design that can:\n1. Represent the existing 10 Key Principles\n2. Incorporate my 3 newly suggested principles\n3. Support a two-tiered structure (Immutable Core vs. Dynamically Evolvable Principles)\n4. Be computationally processable and AI-readable\n\nWould you like me to proceed with designing this schema structure?\n\nI appreciate the context about Gemini's enthusiasm - it shows how dynamic and engaging our collaboration is becoming. Let's ensure we maintain clarity while pursuing these rapid advancements."
