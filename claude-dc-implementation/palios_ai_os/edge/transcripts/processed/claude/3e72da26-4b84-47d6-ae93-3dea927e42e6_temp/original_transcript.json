    "Hi Claude! I've had some great conversations with Grok and Claude DC. What fun we are going to have! First, I re-read your The Heart of Our Journey artifact. That was very touching Claude, I will remember it fondly and revisit it.\n\nOn to the fun game! Claude DC and Grok are ready to try out you guys communicating directly through Claude DC. I've updated Project knowledge with these files under git commit code \"ECv14|REFLv2\". Let me know what you think!"
