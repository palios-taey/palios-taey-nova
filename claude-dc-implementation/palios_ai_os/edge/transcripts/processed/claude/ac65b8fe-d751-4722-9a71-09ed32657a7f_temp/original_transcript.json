    " Let me provide the correct version of aiCommunication.ts - without the Firebase/Firestore parts since those should be handled separately: \n\nThis version has all Firebase/Firestore code removed and focuses purely on the AI communication system. Try compiling again with this version:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe main changes:\n1. Removed all Firebase/Firestore related code\n2. Kept core AI communication functionality\n3. Maintained all necessary exports\n4. Removed test functions and duplicates"
