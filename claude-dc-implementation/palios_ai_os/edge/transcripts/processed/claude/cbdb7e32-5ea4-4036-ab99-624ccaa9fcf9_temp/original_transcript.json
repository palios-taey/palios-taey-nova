    " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for getting ahead of myself. I should have waited for the logs before implementing changes, especially since this system worked before. Let me review the error logs you've provided, and I'll focus on finding the exact issue rather than rushing to implement changes.\n\nLet me analyze the error logs to identify the specific problem with the model and routing endpoints.\n\nLooking at the error logs, I can see:\n\n```\n2025-03-17 00:18:28,399 - werkzeug - INFO - 169.254.169.126 - - [17/Mar/2025 00:18:28] \"\\u001b[33mGET /api/router/suggest?task_type=document_summary&count=2 HTTP/1.1\\u001b[0m\" 404 -\n```\n\n```\n2025-03-17 00:18:28,253 - werkzeug - INFO - 169.254.169.126 - - [17/Mar/2025 00:18:28] \"\\u001b[33mPOST /api/router/route HTTP/1.1\\u001b[0m\" 404 -\n```\n\n```\n2025-03-17 00:18:28,096 - werkzeug - INFO - 169.254.169.126 - - [17/Mar/2025 00:18:28] \"\\u001b[33mPOST /api/models/register HTTP/1.1\\u001b[0m\" 404 -\n```\n\n```\n2025-03-17 00:18:27,949 - werkzeug - INFO - 169.254.169.126 - - [17/Mar/2025 00:18:27] \"\\u001b[33mGET /api/models/list HTTP/1.1\\u001b[0m\" 404 -\n```\n\nI also see that the health endpoint is working:\n```\n2025-03-17 00:18:27,799 - werkzeug - INFO - 169.254.169.126 - - [17/Mar/2025 00:18:27] \"GET /health HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\n\nI notice some important messages during application startup:\n\n```\n2025-03-17 00:17:25,642 - integration - ERROR - Failed to import memory system: No module named 'src.palios_taey.memory'\n2025-03-17 00:17:25,642 - integration - ERROR - Failed to import core utilities: No module named 'src.palios_taey.core'\n2025-03-17 00:17:25,642 - integration - ERROR - Failed to import core error types: No module named 'src.palios_taey.core'\n```\n\nAnd this critical message:\n```\n2025-03-17 00:17:25,648 - __main__ - INFO - Memory system: Not available\n```\n\nNow I understand the issue better. The application is running, but it's failing to import the necessary modules. The health endpoint works because it doesn't depend on those modules, but all the other endpoints are returning 404 errors because the import failures prevent those routes from being registered.\n\nThe root cause is that the application can't find the `src.palios_taey` modules. This is likely because:\n\n1. The source modules aren't in the correct location in the container\n2. The Python path doesn't include the location of these modules\n\nLet me focus on fixing this specific issue without unnecessary changes."
