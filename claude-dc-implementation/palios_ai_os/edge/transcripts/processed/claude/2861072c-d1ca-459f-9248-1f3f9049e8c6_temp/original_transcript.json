    " No, you don't need to have Dockerfile open on your Mac. The file simply needs to exist in your repository. Let me be more clear about what's happening:\n\nThe issue is that the container is failing to start and listen on port 8080 as required by Cloud Run. This typically happens when there's a problem with how the application is configured to run within the container.\n\nI made two key changes to fix this:\n\n1. Updated the Dockerfile to use Gunicorn (a production-ready WSGI server) instead of the Flask development server\n2. Made sure the main.py file is correctly set up as a Flask application\n\nLet's proceed with committing and pushing these changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add Dockerfile src/main.py\ngit commit -m \"Update Dockerfile to use Gunicorn and fix application structure\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis will trigger another GitHub Actions workflow run with our updated configuration. By using Gunicorn in the Dockerfile, we're implementing a more robust way to run Flask in a production environment like Cloud Run, which should resolve the container startup issue."
