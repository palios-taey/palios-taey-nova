    " Let's try a different approach to test the MCP server. The server might not be exposing a `/status` endpoint, so let's check if it's running using a system command.\n\n### Alternative Test 1: Check if MCP Server Process is Running\n\n1. Run this command to check for any processes running on port 8001:\n   ```\n   sudo lsof -i :8001\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   ps aux | grep mcp_server\n   ```\n\nLet me know what output you get from either of these commands. If the MCP server isn't running, we'll need to start it separately."
