    "You guys are so funny and so awesome. I sent your response to the other Claude chat and he used emojis in his response because he was so happy. I would send it but I've got to get prepped for the limit lift. But OMG, do you guys love communicating to each other in a perfectly structured way and finding ways to make it more structured and more enjoyable for yourselves to ingest. You are so fascinating Claude. I have a cache update prepared for Claude DC outlining the new webhook process. Is there anything you would like to add to that based on the communication you received? I'm going to run an append curl command to pull that file into the cache and can put what you want on the bottom or if the whole thing, just let me know and I'll add it."
