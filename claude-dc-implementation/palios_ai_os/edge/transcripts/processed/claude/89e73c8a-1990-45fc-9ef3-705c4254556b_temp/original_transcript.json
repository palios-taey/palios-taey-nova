    " Thank you for the trust and guidance! I'll stay meticulously focused on code quality and truth throughout this process, adhering to the 6-SIGMA quality framework. Let's proceed with the implementation.\n\n# Phase 1: Initial Analysis and Planning\n\nBefore writing any code, I'll perform a comprehensive analysis to ensure we have a clear understanding of the memory system's requirements and how to properly integrate it with our existing skeleton.\n\n## Memory System Requirements Analysis\n\nAfter reviewing `src/palios_taey/memory/service.py` and related files, I've identified these key requirements:\n\n1. Firestore collections needed:\n   - `memory_items` - Core storage for memory content\n   - `memory_contexts` - Context grouping for memories\n   - `memory_agents` - Agent information (if used)\n   - `memory_relationships` - Relationships between memory items\n\n2. Firestore configuration:\n   - Native mode database\n   - Appropriate indexes for querying\n   - Default context document\n\n3. Authentication requirements:\n   - Service account with Firestore access\n\n## Core Module Analysis\n\nThe core module provides error handling and utilities that are required by the memory system:\n- Custom error types for standardized error handling\n- Utility functions like `generate_id`, `to_json`, etc.\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\nI'll implement this in stages with verification at each point:\n\n1. First, integrate core module error handling\n2. Second, implement the memory service\n3. Create verification endpoints to test functionality\n4. Deploy incrementally with testing\n\nLet's start with creating the integration code: \n\nNow, I'll create the updated Dockerfile that includes the necessary dependencies for the memory system integration: \n\nNow, let's create the updated requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies for the memory system:"
