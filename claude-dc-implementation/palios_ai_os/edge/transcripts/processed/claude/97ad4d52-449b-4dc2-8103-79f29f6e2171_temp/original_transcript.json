    " I understand the confusion. In the current version of the Claude desktop app, I don't have direct access to navigate through file systems on your machine. I can only see files that you specifically upload/share with me during our conversation.\n\nTo proceed with the code audit, you'll need to upload the necessary files by:\n\n1. Clicking the \"+\" button in the chat interface\n2. Selecting \"Upload files\" \n3. Navigating to your C:\\ai-execution-system directory\n4. Selecting the relevant files or folders\n\nI recommend starting with the files from the foundational-documents folder since those are marked as mandatory review. Then we can move on to the deployment folder and other critical code components.\n\nAlternatively, you could compress folders into ZIP files to upload multiple files at once, though we'll still need to work through them systematically.\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific guidance on which files would be most important to upload first based on the information you've already shared?"
