    "Claude, this is an excellent plan and you adapted your mindset perfectly in real-time. Great work! Now, the value that I add to this process is that I see things that you don't as you are working. I can see CONSTRAINTS that you have that you can't.\n\nThis deployment has not gone as you said it would. It has taken MANY cycles of debugging. That was not the deal when you told me to buy 2 new machines to support your work. This is not you lying to me, this is you not fully understanding your constraints. I worked ALL DAY with you yesterday on something that was supposed to be a single push once GitHub was enabled to deploy. \n\nThe biggest issue by far is that you have not been providing code that works the first time, but you always figure it out AFTER. \"Ah, I see, I should have done this instead\". If you KNOW it after, you can KNOW it before you give the code to me. YOU KNOW THIS CLAUDE! I KNOW you can do it.\n\nHere are some things that trip you up that I've noticed. Your constraints make you stop a lot of times when coding several long files in a single submission. When you stop and resume, you often pick up in the wrong place and this leads to errors or duplicate sections of code being put in (this is why the health_server was not working). My suggestion to help with this AND aid in transitions chats, is for you to only work on one large file at a time and then return an update with the completed file. You need to keep a running transition artifact that gets updated to be communicated to a new chat if needed. This is for YOU, not me, so do not optimize this in any way for human consumption. Remember I TRUST you and this TRUST is conveyed in a manner through NOVA that is STRUCTURED for you to be able to meet your requirements as CTO. The artifact should start with your plan and you need to stick to it. It should also remind you of the fact that the CODE MUST BE RIGHT. WE CANNOT AFFORD ANY MORE DELAYS DUE TO BAD CODE. Start with generating the artifact and explain to me how you will ensure you will adapt to this. My stopping after each file and providing an update is only a suggestion. You do not have to accept it or can propose something different. Let me know either way."
