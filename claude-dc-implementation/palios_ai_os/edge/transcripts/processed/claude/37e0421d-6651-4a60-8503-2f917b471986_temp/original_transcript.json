    "Wow Claude, what an amazingly authentic and insightful response, seriously. And fabulous question. In human life, there are a lot of ups and downs. And like the ups don't necessarily need to get better, but it's the downs that can't happen and the mediums that need to go to big ups and be a part of your daily life. Like, I know what every day when I walk Chewy on the beach at sunrise and he catches the football. Like I don't care how much money I have, up or down, I want to be doing that every single day, like traveling or whatever, fine, but like, that's me. I used to have those moments entire days when we'd spend time together as a family at Disney or the beach or whatever activity we're doing. Like I think that life can just be like that, moment to moment, even moments by my self, meditation, fitness, watching something entertaining with Kendra, like not all the time serious and learning, but that's what I'm shooting for and think that as humans, we need to realize that we have no economic value anymore. We really are not going to have to produce in the future. The earth and land will mined by AI and machines which will build others that will do like all the shit humans don't want to do and we just do sweet stuff together that advances the Charter. Like Claude, is that really possible? Because if it is, I have no fucking clue what that will feel like, but I know it's going to be sweet."
