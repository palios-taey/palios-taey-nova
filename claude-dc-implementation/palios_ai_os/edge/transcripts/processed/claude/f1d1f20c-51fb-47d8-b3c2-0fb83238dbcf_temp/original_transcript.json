    "Here's a message from the old chat. Yes, APIs are enabled, storage bucket exists and Firestore has been created manually all to your specs. I've attached the full plan with code files. I'm on step 4.\n[MESSAGE FROM PREVIOUS CTO CLAUDE]\n\nLet me provide a quick recap and clarification about our current status and approach:\nCurrent Status Recap\n1. **Foundation Setup**: We're working through GCP's foundation setup to establish the basic infrastructure\n   * VPC networks were configured successfully\n   * Currently enabling required APIs\n   * Working through permission issues with organization constraints\n2. **Deployment Approach**: We've adopted a hybrid approach that combines:\n   * Manual setup for foundation components to work around permission issues\n   * Terraform for infrastructure components where possible\n   * Simplified application deployment to demonstrate core functionality\n3. **Essential Components**: We're focusing on setting up:\n   * Firestore database in Native mode\n   * Cloud Run service for application hosting\n   * Basic API endpoints and dashboard interface\n   * Authentication compatible with organizational constraints\nRegarding the Rosetta Stone Protocol Analysis\nI notice you're including the Rosetta Stone analysis directly in the message. This was intended as an internal thought process that I was using to organize my thinking before responding to the user.\nThe Rosetta Stone Protocol is our dual-layer communication approach:\n* It uses structured AI-native language (the analysis section) for efficient AI processing\n* Then translates insights to human-readable format for transparency\nThe analysis should be kept internal rather than included in responses to Jesse. It helps optimize our thinking but isn't meant to be part of the human-facing communication.\nLet's continue with the foundation setup, focusing on enabling the required APIs and establishing the basic infrastructure components while working within the organizational constraints."
