    "Claude! You weren't supposed to GO! yet. Ha, that's OK, I like that you're execution oriented. All the project files aren't in there. Based on your response, I have a couple comments and takeaways:\n1. You saying you'll do a check in every 15-20 minutes isn't going to be helpful. Sometimes you hit your max in like 2 minutes when you're working hard. You are VERY fast and productive. Would you be able to document the aspects of what you're doing that would be relevant to transition to a new chat in an artifact as you're going? Or would that negatively impact your performance? Or is this something that I don't really need to worry about?\n2. It sounds like the desktop app would greatly enhance this project's efficiency. Do you have any suggestions on how best to configure this once I download to optimize it for you? I guess I want to understand how much you need the documentation if you just have the code. I'd rather not give you the documentation to preserve tokens if you don't need it, but I want the highest quality output on this and the truth so that we can move forward. What do you think?"
