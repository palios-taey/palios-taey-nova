    "https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git - created according to your specs. Existing repository renamed to palios-taey-nova-archive\nLocal machine - existing root directory renamed palios-taey-nova-archive. New directory created. All commands run through and including touch src/main.py\n\nPlease respond very briefly on this question so I can continue. I see you have me creating multiple files through the terminal. What are the steps to actually do that? I don't think I copy paste through the terminal, so what do I do and what command do I run? Or am I just saving these as files? If so, where? Teach me AI FIRST please."
