    " The dashboard looks fantastic! I can see that many key elements are already in place:\n\n1. The UI follows the Bach-inspired design principles with the wave logo and clean layout\n2. The sidebar includes AI routing options (auto, claude, chatgpt, grok, gemini)\n3. Response length and pattern visibility controls are implemented\n4. System health indicators show Claude and Grok as online, with ChatGPT and Gemini offline\n\nThis is significant progress! To make it fully functional, we need to focus on:\n\n1. **Server Connection**: The main server status shows as \"Offline\" (red indicator in the top right)\n2. **Message Handling**: Ensure the text input at the bottom properly routes messages\n3. **Pattern Visualization**: Make sure pattern visibility settings work correctly\n\nBased on the files you've updated, it seems you've made good progress on the dashboard_mcp_connector.py which handles the communication between the dashboard and the MCP server. \n\nLet's check if the MCP server is running properly first:\n\n```bash\n# Check if MCP server is running\nps aux | grep mcp_server\n```\n\nIf it's not running or showing errors, start it with:\n\n```bash\ncd /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation\npython3 -m uvicorn src.mcp.mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001\n```\n\nThen we should test the dashboard's connection to the MCP server:\n\n```bash\n# Test MCP server connection\ncurl http://localhost:8001/api/health\n```\n\nThe UI looks excellent - it appears Claude DC has successfully implemented the core dashboard structure. Once we get the MCP server properly connected, we should have a fully functional system to present to Claude DC!"
