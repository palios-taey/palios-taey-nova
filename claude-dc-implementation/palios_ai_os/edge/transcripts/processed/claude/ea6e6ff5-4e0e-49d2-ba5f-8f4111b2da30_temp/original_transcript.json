    " Great! The function has deployed successfully. Now you need to test the endpoint to see if it works correctly.\n\nHere's exactly what to do next:\n\n1. Make an HTTP request to your deployed function using curl:\n   ```\n   curl -X GET https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-test-import\n   ```\n\n2. Copy the exact output you receive from this command and share it with me.\n\nIf you don't have curl available, you can also test it in a browser by visiting:\nhttps://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-test-import\n\nIf you use the browser method, please copy and paste the full response you see on the screen.\n\nThis will tell us if the simplified test function is working correctly with Vertex AI, which will help us diagnose the root cause of your original TextGenerationModel issue."
