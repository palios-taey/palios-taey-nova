    " You don't need to create a separate \"Model Lister Utility\" file. The updated `model-lister` code I provided is meant to be incorporated into your `main.py` file, which already has the `list_available_models` function.\n\nAll the changes I made to that function were included in the complete `main.py` file I shared earlier, so if you've replaced your main.py with the complete version I provided, you already have those changes incorporated.\n\nJust to summarize what needs to be done:\n\n1. Replace your current `gemini_integration.py` with the updated version that uses the newer model names and dynamic model discovery.\n\n2. You can either:\n   - Use the complete `main.py` file I provided earlier, which already includes all necessary changes, or\n   - Keep your existing `main.py` file if you prefer, since the key changes were in the `gemini_integration.py` file\n\nThat's it! No separate utility file needs to be created. Once you've updated the code, you can test it with the curl commands I shared previously."
