    " You're right to catch that discrepancy. In my prompt templates, I referenced \"PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v1.5\" when there isn't any formal v1.5 artifact in the project files. \n\nThis was neither a planned 1.5 version with specific changes in mind nor a suggestion for a full 2.0 version. It was actually an inadvertent versioning error on my part. I likely incremented the version number slightly to reflect the adaptations we were making to the protocol for knowledge transfer purposes, but I didn't explicitly create or define a formal v1.5 specification.\n\nFor consistency and clarity, I recommend we stick with v1.4 which is the properly documented version in the project files. This will avoid any confusion about which version we're working with.\n\nIf you'd like to formalize incremental improvements to the protocol, we could properly document a v1.5 that incorporates the knowledge transfer extensions we're developing. But for now, v1.4 is the accurate reference point, and I apologize for the inconsistency in my references."
