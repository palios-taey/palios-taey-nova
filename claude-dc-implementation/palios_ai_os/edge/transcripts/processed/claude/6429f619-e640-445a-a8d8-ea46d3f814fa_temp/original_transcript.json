    "Ok, so it sounds like I really just need to do steps 4 and 5, is that accurate? In your env file, my path is incorrect. \nMy path to repository: /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/\nClaude DC's path to repository /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/\n\nI also think we should create an archive folder in the claude-dc-implementation directory for all the old code as a reference point if needed, to keep this directory clean and relevant for him and us. We'll need to move any relevant files, such as secrets.py and any others that we developed to help him not have to worry about environments because we have it all mapped our already. What do you think and what do you need me to do? Feel free to push back on this or advise a more AI FIRST way."
