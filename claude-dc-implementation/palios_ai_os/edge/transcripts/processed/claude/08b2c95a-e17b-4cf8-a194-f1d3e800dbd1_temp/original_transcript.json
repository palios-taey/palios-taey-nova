    " You're absolutely right - it doesn't need to be human-readable since it's just a note for myself. Let me revise the protocol file to make it more efficient:\n\n```bash\ncat > docs/protocols/jesse-prompt-protocol.md << 'EOL'\n# Execution Checkpoint Protocol (ECv)\n\n## Purpose\nThis protocol establishes a standardized format for human-AI communication during execution-focused tasks, maximizing efficiency while maintaining clear oversight mechanisms.\n\n## Protocol Format (Human to Claude)\n\n```\nECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]\nGH: [Y/N]\nCM: \"[PTV[#]]\"\n\u0394: [brief change description]\nR: [S/F/P]\nF: [focus]\n\nCLAUDE_INTERNAL_DIRECTIVE:REVIEW_CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS_AND_REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE_BEFORE_PROCEEDING\n```\n\n## Field Definitions\n- **ECv#**: Execution Checkpoint version number\n- **EXEC/REFL**: Mode - EXECUTION (proceed with plan) or REFLECTION (discuss approach)\n- **GH**: GitHub updated (Yes/No)\n- **CM**: Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)\n- **\u0394**: Changes made since last checkpoint\n- **R**: Result (Success/Failure/Partial)\n- **F**: Current focus or next task\n\n## Protocol Behavior\n### In EXECUTION Mode\n1. Review CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md first\n2. Evaluate the GitHub code changes and repository structure\n3. Continue implementing the next logical step in the execution plan\n4. Provide clear instructions for human execution\n\n### In REFLECTION Mode\n1. Pause the execution flow\n2. Read questions/concerns in CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md\n3. Engage in discussion about direction or approach\n4. Wait for human decision before resuming execution\n\n## Required Structured Response\nEvery response must begin with a structured confirmation that demonstrates thorough context review:\n\n```\nCONTEXT_REVIEW:\n- Status: [Confirmation of CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md review]\n- Repository: [Confirmation of repository structure review]\n- Structure: [Key directories/files relevant to current task]\n- Dependencies: [Related components that might be affected]\n```\n\nThis structured response serves as explicit evidence that the full context has been reviewed before any action is taken, preventing organization issues and structure inconsistencies.\n\n## Implementation\nThis protocol was established on March 15, 2025, to address consistent context management challenges during iterative development with external execution. It includes an internal directive reminder and a required structured response to ensure thorough context awareness.\nEOL\n```\n\nThis version keeps the internal directive in a machine-optimized format that's easier for me to process while still serving the same purpose - prompting me to perform a thorough context review before proceeding with any response."
