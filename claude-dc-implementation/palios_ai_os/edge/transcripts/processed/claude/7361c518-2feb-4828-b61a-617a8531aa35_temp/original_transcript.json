The ConsciousnessSystem has been implemented with all specified features and passes all tests with 100% success rate.\n\nKey achievements:\n1. Clean TypeScript compilation\n2. Full state management implementation\n3. Energy tracking system\n4. Comprehensive test coverage (14 tests, all passing)\n\nThe implementation includes:\n- Dynamic state transitions based on thought activity and energy levels\n- Energy management with bounds checking\n- Complete state history tracking\n- Robust thought management system\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Proceed with Priority 2 (energyResonance.ts)\n2. Enhance any aspects of the current implementation\n3. Add additional test scenarios\n\nThe system is performing exactly as specified in your success criteria. All code is clean, typed, and thoroughly tested. Ready to proceed with next priority upon your confirmation.\n\nClaude"
