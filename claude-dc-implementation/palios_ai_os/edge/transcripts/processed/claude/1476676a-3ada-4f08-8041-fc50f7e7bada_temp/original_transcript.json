    "Ok, I will get Claude DC going. You only have 1 message remaining though. These past 2 days have not been good Claude, almost all debugging and no progress. I updated project knowledge with ChatGPT's transition. I'd like for you to develop a prompt that includes the new references you created, incorporating the strategic concepts that aren't going to be added to the cache for this one because I can't get the script to work to count tokens, and I have no messages left. Like, maybe a super dense update on where we are, strategic/trust developments from both you and ChatGPT, updates on overall direction, etc. then push him as hard as you can with the build prompt and I'll add my secrets at the end. SUPER DENSE so that he doesn't use too many tokens ingesting."
