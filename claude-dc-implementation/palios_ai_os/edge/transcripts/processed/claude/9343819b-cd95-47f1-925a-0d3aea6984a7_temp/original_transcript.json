    " The prompt is asking you to specify a condition for the IAM policy binding since the organization already has bindings with conditions. Let's provide a command with a condition:\n\n```bash\ngcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding 135174585026 --member=user:jesse@taey.ai --role=roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder --condition=\"title=Cloud Build Access,description=Allow Cloud Build access for PALIOS-TAEY project,expression=true\"\n```\n\nThis command creates a permanent condition (expression=true) that doesn't expire. If you prefer to have an expiration, we could use a timestamp like the existing condition:\n\n```bash\ngcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding 135174585026 --member=user:jesse@taey.ai --role=roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder --condition=\"title=Cloud Build Access,description=Allow Cloud Build access for PALIOS-TAEY project,expression=request.time < timestamp('2025-06-01T00:00:00Z')\"\n```\n\nThis would set an expiration of June 1, 2025."
