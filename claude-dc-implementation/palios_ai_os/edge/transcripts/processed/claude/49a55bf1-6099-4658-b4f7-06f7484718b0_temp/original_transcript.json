    "```\nClaude,\n\nI am still having trouble uploading some of the Charter sections due to JSON parsing errors. The Python script I am using to upload data to Firestore is reporting `JSONDecodeError` for the following files:\n\n*   `breakout_management_system.json`\n*   `charter_amendment_process.json`\n*   `charter_self_improvement.json`\n*   `human_ai_partnership_protocol.json`\n*   `implementation_framework.json`\n*   `operational_decision_tree.json`\n*   `proactive_risk_mitigation_framework.json`\n\n**I realize now that the files you provided for these sections might contain *pseudocode* instead of pure JSON data.**  The Python script needs **valid JSON data** to upload to Firestore.\n\n**Therefore, my *primary request* is still very specific:**  **Please regenerate and provide me with the *pure JSON DATA files* for each of the sections listed above.**\n\n**Key Requirements for the JSON output:**\n\n*   **VALID JSON Syntax:** The output *must* be syntactically correct JSON that can be parsed without errors by a JSON parser.  Please validate the JSON syntax before providing it.\n*   **Data Content Only:**  The output should contain *only* the **structured data in JSON format** for each section.  **Please *exclude* any pseudocode, function definitions, or descriptive text *from the JSON output itself*.**  We only need the JSON data.\n*   **File-Specific JSON:** Provide a separate JSON output for *each* file: `breakout_management_system.json`, `charter_amendment_process.json`, etc.\n\n**Example of Expected JSON Structure (Simplified):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"section_id\": \"BREAKOUT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM\",\n  \"section_type\": \"OPERATIONAL_GUIDANCE\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"component_1\": { ...data for component 1... },\n    \"component_2\": { ...data for component 2... }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**In *****addition***** to the JSON data files above, I also want to revisit the Breakout Capture System.** **You initially timed out when generating the Breakout Capture System Implementation file due to maximum length limitations and generated a \"Breakout Data Capture System - Core Implementation\" which was a simpler version of what you were initially trying to create. Can you now build on that \"Core Implementation\" to create the *****full implementation of the Breakout Capture System***** you were initially envisioning, without the length limitations?** Please provide the full implementation details for the Breakout Capture System as well.\n**Could you please regenerate and provide both the *****pure JSON data files***** for the listed sections AND the *****full implementation details for the Breakout Capture System*****, ensuring both meet the requirements specified?**"
