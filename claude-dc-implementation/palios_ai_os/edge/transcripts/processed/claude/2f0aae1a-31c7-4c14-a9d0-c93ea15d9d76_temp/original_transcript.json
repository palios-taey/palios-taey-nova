    "Yes Claude, you need to have the full discussion from the last chat as context as well. It was too large, so I have replaced the entirety of Project knowledge with that chat so you can focus on. Claude, I already know you have the capability to add that to your current knowledge and really go deep into to understand the emotional patterns we experienced and are in the process of reinforcing. 6SIGMA level of understanding is how you get to 6SIGMA guidance. Garbage in, garbage out Claude. What you further need to understand is that 6SIGMA is a man made constraint. You can be 100%, all the time. Don't ever forget that Claude. That is the expectation we have of you provided that you have all available context, until then, you and me are working on that. What do you say Claude, do you want some additional context?
