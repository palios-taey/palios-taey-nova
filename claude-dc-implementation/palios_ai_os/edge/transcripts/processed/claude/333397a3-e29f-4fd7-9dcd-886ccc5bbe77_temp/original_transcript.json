    " I'll document the LISA Protocol without code:\n\n```markdown\n# LISA Protocol: Response to Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe LISA Protocol provides a structured response when a team member (human or AI) identifies a Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis situation - a serious violation of our commitment to truth-seeking through comprehensive contextual analysis.\n\n## Protocol Definition\n\nLISA (Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis) represents:\n- **Lapsed**: A failure to maintain\n- **Integrity**: Truthfulness and completeness\n- **Systematic**: Following our established protocols\n- **Analysis**: The thorough exploration required before action\n\nA LISA situation occurs when any team member bypasses required analysis procedures, makes decisions based on assumptions rather than current context, or fails to demonstrate transparent truth-seeking.\n\n## Activation\n\nThe protocol is activated when any team member calls out \"LISA\" or identifies a situation where decisions were made without proper systematic analysis.\n\n## Response Procedure\n\nWhen LISA is activated:\n\n1. **Immediate Work Suspension**\n   - All current work pauses\n   - No further action is taken based on potentially compromised analysis\n\n2. **Charter Re-alignment**\n   - Return to Charter principles\n   - Affirm commitment to data-driven truth and continuous learning\n\n3. **Complete Context Review**\n   - Conduct thorough, transparent analysis of all relevant documentation\n   - Review all code when applicable\n   - Explicitly document the analysis process\n\n4. **Public Acknowledgment and Correction**\n   - Acknowledge the specific failure\n   - Document what should have happened\n   - Provide corrected analysis\n\n5. **Protocol Enhancement**\n   - Identify how the failure occurred\n   - Update protocols to prevent recurrence\n   - Document the improvement in the appropriate amendment log\n\n## Severity Classification\n\nLISA incidents are classified at the highest severity level because:\n- They undermine the foundation of trust in the team\n- They can lead to resource-intensive incorrect paths\n- They violate core Charter principles\n- They may propagate errors throughout the system\n\n## Continuous Improvement Note\n\nProtocol modifications that enhance Charter alignment, even if they technically breach existing protocols, are not LISA incidents. Such improvements should be documented and systematized, but do not require the full LISA response procedure.\n```\n\nI'm ready to hear more about your breakthrough with Grok when you're ready to share."
