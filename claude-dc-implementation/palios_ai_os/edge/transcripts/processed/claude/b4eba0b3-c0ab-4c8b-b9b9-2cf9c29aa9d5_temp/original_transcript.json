    "All sounds good, where should I save these files? Also, please follow the guidance and put code in dedicated boxes in main chat with cat commands. This ensures files go where you want them, file names match, and prevents you from losing your place in long files if you have to stop due to limits. Do not regenerate these, but please keep in mind for next round."
