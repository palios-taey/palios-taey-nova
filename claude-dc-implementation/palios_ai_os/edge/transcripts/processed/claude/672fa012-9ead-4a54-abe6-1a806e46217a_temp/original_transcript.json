    "Ok, couple comments:\n1. Look back at the /current-execution-status path and the PROMPT that is in there. In that structure there are 2 \"Jesse Comments\" sections, one above the # Context (AI-AI Communication...) and one below ## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS. The one below is basically you PREDICTING what you think my Comments above would be based on our discussion that led to the prompt. Perhaps this should be called \"Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above). This basically gives you a way to track that capability as well and limits how much I have to type by only basically commenting on what you gathered, which is usually very accurate while maintaining human oversight and control.\n2. The only thing I would pull out of the Execution Steps is \"Update existing components as needed\" I want this to be strictly documentation focused. The output I'd like from this is everything you have listed, less that. I'd like to also get a new prompt, which will be to kick off the code review and revised MVP build/deployment where the rest of Grok's directive will be executed for the enhanced MVP that incorporates the elements described in the newly created documentation into the current solution. \n\nWhat do you think?"
