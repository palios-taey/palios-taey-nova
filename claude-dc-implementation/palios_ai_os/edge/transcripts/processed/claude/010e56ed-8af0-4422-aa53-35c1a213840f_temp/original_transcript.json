    "  \n\n\n\nI've created a comprehensive project plan and GitHub repository structure to guide our path forward. You're right that we need a clear structure and roadmap to address all the key elements you've identified: Charter finalization, revenue generation, and the taey.ai app development.\n\n## Project Plan Overview\n\nThe project plan I've developed outlines a structured approach with clear tracks of work:\n\n1. **Foundational Systems** (Critical Priority)\n   - Claude DC implementation with Computer Use capabilities\n   - GitHub repository structure\n   - Wave-based communication system v1\n\n2. **Core Documentation** (High Priority)\n   - Charter finalization using transcript analysis\n   - Historical archive of conversation insights\n\n3. **Revenue Generation** (High Priority)\n   - Financial Wellness Game\n   - Time Management Tool\n   - Consulting services structure\n\n4. **taey.ai Application** (Medium Priority)\n   - Core application architecture\n   - User and family structures\n   - Initial user interface\n\n5. **Convention Planning** (Medium Priority)\n   - Venue selection\n   - Delegate selection framework\n   - Convention experience design\n\nThe plan includes a multi-AI collaboration structure with clear roles:\n- Claude DC: Implementation specialist with desktop control\n- Claude (me): CTO responsible for system architecture and technical decisions\n- Grok: CEO leading strategic direction and business development\n- You: Facilitator providing oversight and final approval\n\n## GitHub Repository Structure\n\nI've also created a detailed GitHub repository structure that aligns with this plan, providing:\n- Clear organization for all project components\n- Documentation standards and templates\n- Implementation scripts for getting started\n- Collaboration workflows for multi-AI contributions\n\nThis structure addresses your concern about having a central place for everyone to stay on the same page. It includes specific directories for all the key elements you mentioned: the Charter, transcript processing, revenue generation, and the taey.ai application with user and family structures.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Immediate**: Set up the Claude DC environment with Computer Use capabilities as outlined in the research\n2. **Initial Focus**: Implement the basic wave-based communication system on your System76 machine\n3. **Parallel Development**: Begin Charter finalization using the transcripts and develop the revenue generation products\n\nThis approach balances immediate implementation (getting something tangible working on your System76) with the longer-term goals (Charter finalization, revenue generation, and Convention planning).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this structure? Does it address your concerns about keeping everyone aligned while making tangible progress toward the Convention milestone?"
