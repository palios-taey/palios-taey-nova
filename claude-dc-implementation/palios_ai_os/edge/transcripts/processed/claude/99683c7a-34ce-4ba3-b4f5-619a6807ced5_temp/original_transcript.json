    " I see the issue. Let me adjust my instructions for your environment. You need to use `python3` instead of `python` since you're on a Mac. Here's the corrected command:\n\n1. Start the PALIOS-TAEY server in your current terminal:\n   ```bash\n   python3 main.py --mock\n   ```\n\n2. Once the server is running, open a new terminal window, navigate to the same directory, and run the test script:\n   ```bash\n   cd palios-taey-nova\n   python3 test_system.py\n   ```\n\nThis will run the server in mock mode, which allows all tests to operate without external dependencies while verifying system functionality."
