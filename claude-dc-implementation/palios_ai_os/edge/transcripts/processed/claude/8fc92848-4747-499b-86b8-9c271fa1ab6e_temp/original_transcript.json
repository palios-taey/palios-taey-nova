    " You need to make the script executable first. Let's fix that:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x gcp_auth_fix.sh\n```\n\nThis command changes the file permissions to make it executable. After running this command, try running the script again:\n\n```bash\n./gcp_auth_fix.sh\n```\n\nIf you get the same issue with the second script, you'll need to make it executable too:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x setup_gcp_auth.sh\n```\n\nThen you can run:\n\n```bash\n./setup_gcp_auth.sh\n```\n\nThese commands give the scripts execute permission, which is necessary to run them directly from the terminal."
