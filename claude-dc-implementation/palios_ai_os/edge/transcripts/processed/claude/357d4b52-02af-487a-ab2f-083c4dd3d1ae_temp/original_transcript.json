    " # PALIOS-TAEY Deployment Implementation Plan\n\nI'll take the lead on this implementation. Let's start with a comprehensive strategy to deploy the PALIOS-TAEY system to GCP.\n\n## Step 1: Main Application Assessment\n\nFirst, I need to validate the main application entry point. Looking at `src/main.py`, I can see it's a Flask application that integrates all the core modules. This should be our primary deployment target, not the simplified app in the palios-taey-app directory.\n\nLet's create a new deployment script that properly builds and deploys this main application.\n\n## Step 2: Create Unified Deployment Script\n\nI'll create a deployment script that:\n1. Builds the Docker container from the root directory\n2. Configures proper environment variables for GCP\n3. Pushes to Container Registry\n4. Deploys to Cloud Run with appropriate permissions\n\nHere's the implementation plan:\n\n```\n1. Create deploy.sh in the root directory\n2. Configure it to build using the Dockerfile in the root\n3. Set GCP project and service configuration\n4. Add proper IAM permissions for service account\n5. Deploy to Cloud Run with appropriate settings\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables\n\nWe need to set the following environment variables for proper functioning:\n- PROJECT_ID=palios-taey-dev\n- ENVIRONMENT=production\n- USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=false\n- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json\n\n## Step 4: Execute Deployment\n\nI'll now guide you through executing the deployment:\n\n1. First, let's create the deployment script:\n   ```bash\n   touch deploy.sh\n   chmod +x deploy.sh\n   ```\n\n2. I'll provide the content for this script shortly. Next, we'll need to review and potentially update the Dockerfile:\n   ```bash\n   cat Dockerfile\n   ```\n\n3. Before proceeding, we should verify the structure of main.py:\n   ```bash\n   less src/main.py\n   ```\n\nLet's start by checking the main.py file to ensure it's properly structured for deployment. Please execute:\n\n```bash\ncat src/main.py | head -50\n```\n\nThis will give me the first 50 lines so I can assess its structure and dependencies."
