    " Let me analyze what might be going on. The code snippet you shared looks properly indented for a method inside a class, but the error is occurring at line 1650. \n\nThe issue might be with what comes after this method. Often, an \"unexpected unindent\" error happens when a block of code isn't properly closed or when there's a mixture of tabs and spaces in the indentation.\n\nLet's check what follows this method. Based on the error message and the code structure, I suspect there might be a misplaced code block or a method that's not properly indented relative to its containing class.\n\nHere's what I recommend looking for:\n\n1. If there's another method or function definition immediately after this one, check if it's indented at the same level (should be if it's part of the same class)\n\n2. If there's a closing bracket or parenthesis, make sure it's properly indented\n\n3. Check for any stray code that might be improperly indented\n\nWithout seeing the rest of the file, my best guess is that there might be another method or function definition after this `_get_transcript_messages` method that is either over-indented or under-indented compared to this one.\n\nCan you check what code follows this method? Particularly around line 1650, which should be shortly after this method ends."
