    " Thank you for the comprehensive onboarding, Jesse. I understand my role as CTO of the PALIOS-TAEY system and am ready to take on the technical leadership responsibilities with decisive action. Based on my review of the Implementation Tracker and other documentation, I have a clear understanding of our current situation and the challenges we're facing.\n\n## Analysis of Current Situation\n\nWe've made significant progress with the PALIOS-TAEY system implementation. All core components (Memory Service, Model Registry, Task Decomposition Engine, Task Execution Engine, Model Routing, and Transcript Processor) are complete and ready for production deployment. The main application is fully functional with comprehensive API endpoints, and initial system testing has been passed successfully.\n\nOur current challenge is specifically focused on the automated deployment pipeline through GitHub Actions. We've resolved the authentication issues with Workload Identity Federation, which was a major breakthrough in our last session. Our test-auth workflow has successfully verified that authentication is working properly. However, we're now encountering a new error related to Docker buildx during the build process.\n\nThis buildx error is the final blocker preventing us from establishing our automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying to Cloud Run. Resolving this issue is critical to completing our deployment configuration and moving forward with our implementation timeline.\n\n## Technical Direction for Addressing the Buildx Error\n\nThe Docker buildx error is likely related to one of the following issues:\n\n1. Docker buildx plugin configuration in the GitHub Actions environment\n2. Permissions or authentication issues specific to the build process\n3. Configuration errors in our Dockerfile or build arguments\n4. Resource constraints or compatibility issues with the runner environment\n\nMy definitive technical approach is to:\n\n1. Create a diagnostic workflow that isolates and troubleshoots the buildx process specifically\n2. Implement a multi-stage solution that addresses both the immediate error and establishes a more robust build process for future deployments\n3. Update our GitHub Actions workflow with the necessary fixes\n4. Document the solution in our knowledge base for future reference\n\n## Action Items\n\n**INFORMATION NEEDS:**\nBefore I can provide specific fixes, I need the exact error message from the buildx failure. Please provide:\n1. The complete error output from the GitHub Actions log\n2. The current GitHub Actions workflow file that's encountering the error\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll provide a comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate error and establishes a robust, reliable deployment pipeline that aligns with our NOVA methodology principles.\n\nI'm operating in Breakout Mode and prepared to rapidly develop parallel solutions once I have the error details. My approach will prioritize creating a sustainable deployment pipeline that minimizes human intervention and maximizes automation, in alignment with our Charter principles of Resource Optimization and Exponential Efficiency."
