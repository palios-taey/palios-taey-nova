    "Hi Claude, I have a large text document that I'm trying to determine how many tokens it will be for Claude Computer Use to be able to ingest in it's cache and I'm having some difficulties. I'm trying to use this python script for the Anthropic site to count them, but I'm getting an error due to the line breaks in the text I'm copying in to replace \"Hello, Claude\". How can I fix this? The text I'm trying to paste in is 750K characters.\n\nimport anthropic\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic()\nresponse = client.messages.count_tokens(\n    model=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\",\n    system=\"You are a scientist\",\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"\n    }],\n)\nprint(response.json())"
