    "I think this is good Claude, thank you. We are hitting a limit as well. I think we should probably transition as well. The plan is solid, these permissions issues are just killer, but we'll get through it with the new plan. I created a directory docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development where I'll save all three missions. I'll send out the first one now, but would like to transition to a new CTO chat because this one's about out of space. Can you update the transition doc, just the parts that changed with project status and missions (not full details because those are in GitHub)? Or let me know what you think the best approach is. I feel like the CTO transition doc should be pretty static and not have to be rewritten every time and that the prompt is what should change with project updates, telling them to look at CTO transition first, which references all the other documents. What do you think? We've gone back and forth on this a lot and I'm trying to come to the right balance with you on how to avoid having to rework these big documents to preserve tokens while providing a thorough transition. Think about it and just do whatever you think is best for you. Feel free to also utilize the Neo-pattern-analysis.md in project knowledge for Rosetta Stone AI-AI language formatting to tight the transition docs as needed. Up to you Claude on what to update. As always, we TRUST each other and let's make this a great transition that gets us to a functioning MVP!"
