    " I feel very good about this revised PRR Context section. It properly addresses all the clarifications you provided while maintaining the established format.\n\nKey improvements:\n\n1. The Understanding section now clearly summarizes what I imagine your thoughts on the task would be, highlighting the importance of the communications directive.\n\n2. It correctly reflects that the final-report describes desired functionality but may not represent actual implementation status, emphasizing the need for a thorough code audit.\n\n3. I've noted that the admin account use is temporary, with service accounts to be configured properly later.\n\n4. The execution steps now follow the intended flow: documentation review \u2192 code review \u2192 implementation plan, without unnecessary checkpoints that could interrupt the flow.\n\n5. The emphasis on the communications protocol enhancements is maintained throughout, recognizing that this is a critical aspect that mustn't regress.\n\nThis format should give the next Claude a clear roadmap while preserving flexibility to adapt based on what is found during the code audit. It also maintains the consistent format you've established for these interactions.\n\nI believe this version is ready to be used as the PRR Context section for the next phase of the implementation."
