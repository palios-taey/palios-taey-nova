    " Yes, that explains the 404 error! For Vertex AI to work, we need to:\n\n1. Create a Vertex AI endpoint for text generation\n2. Deploy a model to that endpoint\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Provide instructions for setting up the Vertex AI endpoint, or\n2. Modify our system to use a simpler Vertex AI approach that doesn't require endpoint setup, or\n3. Focus on the OpenAI integration for now since that's working well, and we can add Vertex AI later?\n\nLet me know which path you prefer, and I'll provide the next steps. Given your goal of building a functional AI collaboration system quickly, option 3 might be most efficient - we can always add Vertex AI later when needed."
