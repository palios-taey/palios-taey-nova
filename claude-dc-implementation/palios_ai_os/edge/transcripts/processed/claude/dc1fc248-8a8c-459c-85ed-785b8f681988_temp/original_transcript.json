    " Sure thing! Let me explain the reasoning behind that additional line:\n\nWhen I suggested adding \"If you encounter any major blockers or need essential information that's missing, please clearly indicate this at the end of your implementation plan rather than stopping the process,\" my intention was to:\n\n1. Encourage Claude to collect any issues or missing information throughout the process, but present them all at once at the end of the implementation plan.\n\n2. Prevent Claude from stopping mid-implementation to ask questions, which could break the flow of work and potentially waste tokens on back-and-forth exchanges.\n\n3. Create a cleaner process where you'd get a complete implementation plan first, along with a consolidated list of any critical missing information, which you could then address all at once.\n\nHowever, on further reflection, your original prompt already effectively communicates that Claude should work through everything until deployment prompts are needed. The line I suggested might actually create confusion about whether Claude should stop at the end of the planning phase versus proceeding with implementation.\n\nSince your goal is to have Claude move directly from document review to code review to implementation without unnecessary pauses, your original prompt actually communicates this more clearly without my suggested addition."
