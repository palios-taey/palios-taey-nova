    " <thinking>\nIt looks like there's a version mismatch with Flask and Werkzeug packages. The error indicates that `url_quote` cannot be imported from 'werkzeug.urls', which suggests the installed versions of Flask and Werkzeug aren't compatible.\n\nI should provide a simple fix by suggesting to reinstall Flask with a specific version that's known to work.\n</thinking>\n\nThis is a common Flask installation issue caused by a version mismatch between Flask and Werkzeug. Let's fix it by installing compatible versions:\n\n```bash\n# Uninstall current versions\npip3 uninstall -y flask werkzeug\n\n# Install compatible versions\npip3 install flask==2.0.1 werkzeug==2.0.1\n```\n\nThis should resolve the import error by ensuring you have compatible versions of both packages. The error occurred because newer versions of Werkzeug renamed or moved some functions that older versions of Flask depend on.\n\nAfter running these commands, try starting the webhook server again:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/palios-webhook\npython3 webhook_server.py\n```\n\nNo need to regenerate the entire script for this - just fixing the package versions should be sufficient."
