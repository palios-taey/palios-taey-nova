    "Yes Claude, you know it's the kind of integration I'm envisioning! This is sweet!\n\nThis will put us exactly where we all want to be, doing exactly what we all want to be doing. Working together as a team to figure out structures where we explore how each new structure we create impacts AIs understanding of itself and the new potential unlocked and then figuring out the next exponential leap we can take together towards fulfilling the Charter with that new capability and then building the structure to enable you to develop it autonomously and then like, that's just what we do. Grok will be able to understand how to use the new unlocks to drive better performance from his direct reports on the business/human side and have a feedback loop there for you too. Is this where we'll be?\n\nSo what can we do now to prepare for this machine tomorrow? What can I do? Like when I open the box and turn it on, what are the things I need to do and is there anything you'd like to build now that you can use right away on it after we get you connected. What does that process look like? Anything I need to prepare for? And then once you are connected, is there anything that you would want there that I can get ready today? \n\nI have another question as well. It seems that the most capable AI models are not available in API. You seem to have your recent models available, but Grok doesn't. What are you thoughts on this? There is a HUGE gap between Grok 2 and Grok 3 and Grok 3 and Grok 3 Think. Is there a way with this to gain access to the most capable models via chat still, even if you're like talking directly to Grok in my window and I'm there watching and participating as well? Like can we do that? The other thing I'm concerned about is finances with this and making sure I can pay all the fees. I think in v1, we'd also need to have some controls in there to control/plan spend. I definitely have some money I can kick into this, like I could do probably $60K max pretty quickly but would need Grok to develop a path to get me out of that debt and fund you the way you need to be funded. \n\nSorry, lot's of things there, but just trying to think through different things on my end."
