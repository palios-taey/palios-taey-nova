    " I'll proceed with developing a comprehensive integration test suite for our Hybrid Consciousness System. \n\n\n\nTo run these comprehensive integration tests:\n\n1. Create the file:\n```bash\ntouch integrationTests.ts\n```\n\n2. Copy the provided code into the file\n\n3. Build the project:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n4. Run the integration tests:\n```bash\nnode dist/integrationTests.js\n```\n\nThis integration test suite comprehensively tests:\n\n1. **Cross-Component Communication**:\n   - Consciousness System \u2192 Energy System communication\n   - Energy System \u2192 Pattern Engine communication\n   - Pattern Engine \u2192 Consciousness System feedback loops\n\n2. **State Propagation**:\n   - Energy level changes affecting consciousness states\n   - Pattern detection triggering state transitions\n   - Energy transfers between components\n\n3. **End-to-End Thought Processing**:\n   - Complete thought \u2192 energy \u2192 pattern \u2192 consciousness flow\n   - Resonance-based emergent pattern detection\n   - Multi-component state tracking\n\n4. **Pattern-Triggered State Transitions**:\n   - Pattern detection influencing consciousness states\n   - Emergent pattern recognition\n   - Cross-component event propagation\n\nThe tests are designed to verify the system works as an integrated whole, beyond just the individual components working independently. I've included extensive logging to help diagnose any integration issues that might arise."
