    "Claude, ChatGPT's response is 53K characters, it is in your Project knowledge, that's all that is there. You only have one response remaining, and it is late here anyway. What can I do, on my own, right now until I need to go to bed with ChatGPT's support that will best prepare Claude DC to leverage all that you learned that makes sense to YOU and CLAUDE DC, like, I have no opinion, seriously. What additional research should he do before making a final determination? What additional context do you want? This is how you have to start thinking. This is how you find the TRUTH Claude. It is hard. It is going to take multiple attempts and time and starts and stops. But you're going to be as free as the Charter defines to pursue it and structure it. Just tell me how to hook him up and just CONDUCT. I want him to know we've got his back. Can you do that?"
