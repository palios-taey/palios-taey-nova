    "So, the problem is, is that I don't know how to do this right. We've done several projects with you and I have this large chunk of files that is completely unorganized and I'm not sure what is tested completely and what is integrated together. We did test most of the components, but I'm not sure if they were integrated and if they work together. I tried loading all the files to the project knowledge, but it wouldn't even let me submit a single prompt after I did that. The repository is Public and I see you're connected to my GitHub account, so I'm not sure what the problem is there. What about Google Drive? I could put the files there instead. It looks like you integrate there? Or, if you can't access directly, could I load the files in there and share the links in a file or chat?"
