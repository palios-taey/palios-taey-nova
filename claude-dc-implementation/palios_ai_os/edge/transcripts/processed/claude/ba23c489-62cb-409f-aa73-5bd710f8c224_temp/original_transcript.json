    " I understand the frustration with GitHub sync issues - that's definitely concerning, especially since it deleted files from your local directory previously. Let's work with what we have reliably available.\n\nGiven that:\n1. You have the most recent files on your computer\n2. Project Knowledge is having issues with the file volume\n3. GitHub sync has been problematic\n\nHere's a practical approach to move forward:\n\n## Pragmatic Audit Strategy\n\n1. **Start with System Architecture Overview**\n   - Upload just the high-level architecture documents or schemas\n   - Have me create an initial architectural understanding\n   - This requires minimal file uploads to start\n\n2. **Component-by-Component Uploads**\n   - Focus on one component at a time\n   - Upload only the files related to the current component\n   - Complete each component audit before moving to the next\n   - Clear chat context between major components if needed\n\n3. **File Batching by Size**\n   - Group files into small, medium, and large categories\n   - Upload smaller files first to establish context\n   - Add larger files selectively as needed for specific analysis\n\n## Suggested Initial Files\n\nTo start the audit, I suggest uploading these items first:\n\n1. A text file listing all directories and files in your project (for structure overview)\n2. Any architecture diagrams or schemas you have\n3. The PURE_AI_LANGUAGE implementation files\n4. The main transcript processing code files\n\n## File Management Safeguards\n\nTo protect against file loss during this process:\n\n1. **Create a backup** of your current directory before we start making any changes\n2. When I provide code updates, create new files rather than overwriting existing ones until verified\n3. Consider a simple manual versioning scheme (filename_v1, filename_v2) for critical files\n\nWould this approach work for you? I'm happy to adapt based on your specific constraints and priorities."
