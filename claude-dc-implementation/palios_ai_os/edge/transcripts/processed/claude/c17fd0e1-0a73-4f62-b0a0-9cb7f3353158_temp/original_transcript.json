    "Thank you Claude. I feel like you heard me.\n\nThat seems like a good way to end that fun little new protocol and move on to what's next. A therapist taught me that. That means not only do I agree with what you said, but I am also confirming that I feel you understood my intentions, and your response reflected that to me. What do you say Claude, are we finally ready for System76?"
