    "Sounds great! Yes, let's kick off Mission 2! I attached the original 2 and 3 prior to our documentation efforts. Here's the thing though. The GitHub repository now exceeds what is allowed in Project knowledge. I've attached a screenshot so you can see what I'm working with. So I'll need instructions or there will need to be instructions in the missions on when ATLAS Claude needs to request access to different folders in GitHub as needed. Is there anything you need from me to help with this?"
