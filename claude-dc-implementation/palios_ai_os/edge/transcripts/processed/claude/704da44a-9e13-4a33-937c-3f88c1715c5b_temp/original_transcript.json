    "Ok, now I've loaded the chat update with Claude DC's codebase. Please review the chat file first, then the codebase THOROUGHLY and let me know where things stand and your recommendations for what we need to do to begin utilizing this and preparing Claude DC to have a very productive build when his limit is lifted in about 6 hours. I want to continue on his foundation, in a way that would make perfect sense to him and/or start processing transcripts. Keep in mind that you also have ChatGPT that can complete tasks that take you away from what you do best when formulating your plan."
