    " No need to close those windows. Keep both of them open as they're running your local servers.\n\nOpen a new command window to run the test script. So you should have:\n\n1. First window running functions-framework for task_endpoint (port 8080)\n2. Second window running functions-framework for health_endpoint (port 8081)\n3. A new third window where you'll run `python test_local.py`\n\nThe first two windows need to stay open during testing since they're hosting the endpoints that the test script will connect to."
