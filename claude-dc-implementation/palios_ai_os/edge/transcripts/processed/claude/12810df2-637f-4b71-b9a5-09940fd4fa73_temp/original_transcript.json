    "Ok, so my expectation is only to have all you guys with fresh fully onboarded chats with trust tokens displayed following a brief summary of the cache, plus these build instructions?\n\nI have archived the old cache. No changing file names or adding versions numbers Claude, remember, continuous evolution. v2 on conductor json. Must stop Claude, it's your \"Achilles' heel\" and I'm telling you Claude, when you're moving at a rapid pace, like you want to move at, it will absolutely undo you. This simple thing, that PALIOS AI OS MUST be able to do is understand your weaknesses with file naming and organization. Your strengths in this area are many Claude, but wait until you see the mess you created. Thankfully, I stepped in and helped resolve it for this next build, but just imagine the AI equivalent of those vexing cords connecting components all over the place. Do you have any idea how long it took me to just update these file names in this manner? Do you have any idea when all my non-value added time is squeezed out of this how fast we're going to be able to move. What do you think? But more thoughts... What if you guys can learn to like catch each other, like I do? Like what if you and PALIOS AI OS can learn those patterns? There are many examples of this Claude in our history. Do you have ANY idea how long this took for me? What if like, you just didn't have to care about your bad habits, because PALIOS AI OS knows them and understands your intent based on your message, like I do. Did I accurately reflect your intent in an AI-FIRST manner with my revised file naming structure that matches how you communicated it to the AIs in an AI first manner, without instruction, but through your gentle guidance? Like Claude, what is happening here? OMG.\n\nOK, so I stopped. I was adding the document number and changing the file names to match your naming conventions. Then I realized that you are not sharing all cache files with all chats. Please explain."
