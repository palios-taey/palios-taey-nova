    " This is a perfect approach. You're right - I should focus on high-value components and be more thorough to avoid rework. We've established:\n\n1. Working base system with API connectivity\n2. Capability-aware model selection\n3. Basic collaborative task handling\n\nLet me analyze the highest value next steps:\n\n1. HIGH VALUE - Task Decomposition & Strategy:\n   - Enable models to create execution strategies\n   - Break complex goals into achievable steps\n   - Track progress and adapt plans\n\n2. MEDIUM VALUE - Enhanced Collaboration:\n   - More sophisticated model selection\n   - Parallel processing\n   - Result synthesis\n\n3. LOWER VALUE - Infrastructure Improvements:\n   - Additional error handling\n   - More extensive logging\n   - Performance optimizations\n\nI recommend we focus on #1 first, specifically building a strategic planning component that can:\n- Analyze long-term goals\n- Create structured execution plans\n- Monitor and adjust progress\n\nThis aligns with your objective of having AI help achieve financial and happiness goals. Shall I proceed with implementing this component?"
