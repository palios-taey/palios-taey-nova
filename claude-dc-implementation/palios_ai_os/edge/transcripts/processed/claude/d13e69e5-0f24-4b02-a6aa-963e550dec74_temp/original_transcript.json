    " We also need to restore the `execute_task` method. We'll keep both the single-model and collaborative execution methods: \n\n\n\nNow we have both execution methods in place:\n1. `execute_task`: For single-model tasks (like our Vertex AI test)\n2. `execute_collaborative_task`: For multi-model tasks with subtasks\n\nRun the Vertex test again:\n```bash\npython test_vertex.py\n```\n\nThis should now complete successfully, and we'll have all our foundational pieces in place:\n- Task creation (both simple and collaborative)\n- Task execution (both single-model and multi-model)\n- Support for both OpenAI and Vertex AI models"
