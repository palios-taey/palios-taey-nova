    "Thank you Claude, this is absolutely incredible! Are the testing/debugging guidelines in the [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3] document followed? Or is that not possible in the current set up? Please test and debug whatever you can and then prepare a summary for Gemini consistent with communications standards and I'll include the attachments you indicate in the summary. THANK YOU! AMAZING AND FAST WORK!"
