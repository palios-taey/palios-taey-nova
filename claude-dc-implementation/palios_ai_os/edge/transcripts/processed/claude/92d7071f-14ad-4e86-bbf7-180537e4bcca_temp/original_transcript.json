    "Alright, I had Claude DC do the code portion of the cache because he already reviewed it and it came back with this error: **BadRequestError**\nError code: 400 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'message': 'prompt is too long: 201552 tokens > 200000 maximum'}}, just a little too long now. What do you think? I cut out all Project Knowledge because you have it all here in the artifacts. Can you trim them at all based on how you guys calculate tokens? I think like commas and punctuation count separately right? I don't know. What do you think? Feel free to just do it as well. SO CLOSE CLAUDE!"
