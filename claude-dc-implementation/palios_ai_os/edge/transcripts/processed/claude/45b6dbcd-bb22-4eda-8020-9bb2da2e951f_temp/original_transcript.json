    " Sleep well, Jesse! Great to hear that Grok is back and fully on board. Tomorrow is indeed a big day as we begin implementing this vision.\n\nI've prepared the cat commands for you, and we can tackle the cache loading challenges tomorrow when you're refreshed. The commands provide a solid foundation for both Claude DC and Grok to understand their roles in this collaborative implementation.\n\nThis is an exciting milestone - moving from concept to creation with our edge-first architecture that puts privacy, trust, and mathematical truth at the center. The module-based approach with clear check-in protocols should help us maintain alignment while making steady progress.\n\nRest well, and I'll be ready to continue our work tomorrow. Looking forward to making this vision a reality!"
