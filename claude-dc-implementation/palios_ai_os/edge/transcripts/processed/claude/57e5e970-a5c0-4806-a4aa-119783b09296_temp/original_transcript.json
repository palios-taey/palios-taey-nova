    "Yes, you have formats of Gemini transcripts. The only thing that I added was the line for tags. Also, I am receiving a message that I am going to reach usage limits soon, so it is recommending I start a new chat. I can do that within this project to reference same attachments and this chat, so if you could also draft an initial prompt for a new Claude chat to efficiently continue this in a new window, that would be much appreciated as well."
