    " I need to clarify that the artifacts I've created are suggestions for implementation rather than files that have been actually created in your repository. They represent what I recommend creating to deploy the PALIOS-TAEY system.\n\nHere are the file locations and names I'm suggesting:\n\n1. **Main Deployment Script**:\n   - Location: Root directory of repository\n   - Filename: `deploy.sh`\n\n2. **Updated Dockerfile**:\n   - Location: Root directory of repository\n   - Filename: `Dockerfile`\n   - Note: This would replace or update any existing Dockerfile\n\n3. **Updated Requirements File**:\n   - Location: Root directory of repository\n   - Filename: `requirements.txt`\n   - Note: This would replace or update any existing requirements.txt\n\n4. **Service Account Setup Script**:\n   - Location: Root directory of repository\n   - Filename: `setup_service_account.sh`\n\nTo implement this plan, you would need to create these files with the content I've provided. Once created, you would make the scripts executable with `chmod +x deploy.sh` and `chmod +x setup_service_account.sh`, then run the deployment script with `./deploy.sh`.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with guiding you through creating these files and executing the deployment plan?"
