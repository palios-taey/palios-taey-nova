    " This is another organization policy constraint - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` is preventing service account key creation for security reasons. Let's use an alternative approach that doesn't require creating service account keys.\n\nWe can use the identity of your currently logged-in user to generate a token for testing:\n\n```bash\n# Get an identity token using your current user credentials\nTOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)\n\n# Test the health endpoint with your identity token\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/health\n```\n\nIf you don't have the necessary permissions with your current identity, we can take another approach:\n\n```bash\n# Grant your current user identity permission to invoke the service\ngcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding palios-taey-service \\\n  --member=\"user:$(gcloud config get-value account)\" \\\n  --role=\"roles/run.invoker\" \\\n  --region=us-central1\n\n# Then try the identity token approach again\nTOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" https://palios-taey-service-44790150696.us-central1.run.app/health\n```\n\nIf we keep encountering organization policy constraints, our fastest path forward is to change the application deployment to work completely within the constraints. Let's modify our approach to be organization-constraint-friendly and focus on getting our MVP running:\n\n1. Let's continue deploying with authentication required\n2. Let's use your current identity for testing\n3. We'll document these constraints for future enhancement"
