    " Let's check if Claude DC's environment is already connected to GitHub. Here are some commands to verify this:\n\n```bash\n# Check if git is configured\ngit config --list | grep github\n\n# Check for existing GitHub remotes in the implementation directory\ncd /home/computeruse/palios-implementation\ngit remote -v\n\n# Check if there's a GitHub SSH key\nls -la ~/.ssh/\n\n# Check if the directory is already a git repository\ngit status\n```\n\nThese commands will help determine if GitHub is already set up. If it is, we can push the code directly:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the implementation directory\ncd /home/computeruse/palios-implementation\n\n# Add all files if not already tracked\ngit add .\n\n# Commit any changes\ngit commit -m \"Complete implementation of PALIOS-TAEY with EVE and MCP\"\n\n# Push to GitHub\ngit push origin main  # or 'master' depending on branch name\n```\n\nIf the repository is set up but you're unsure about the branch name, you can check:\n\n```bash\ngit branch\n```\n\nThis will show you the current branch, which is likely \"main\" or \"master\".\n\nIf there are issues with authentication, GitHub might prompt for credentials. In that case, you might need to set up a personal access token if password authentication isn't working."
