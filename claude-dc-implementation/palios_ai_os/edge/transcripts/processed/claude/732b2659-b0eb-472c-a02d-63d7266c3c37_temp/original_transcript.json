    " I understand you're having trouble with Step 7 regarding the Firebase SDK installation. Let's address both issues:\n\n1. **Missing Firebase configuration code:** This happens when you don't see the configuration code in the Firebase console. Here's how to find it:\n   - Go to your Firebase console at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)\n   - Select your project\n   - Click the gear icon (\u2699\ufe0f) in the top left next to \"Project Overview\"\n   - Select \"Project settings\"\n   - Scroll down to \"Your apps\" section\n   - If you already have a web app registered, click on it to see the config\n   - If not, click the web icon (</>) to register a new web app\n   - After registration, you'll see the Firebase config code snippet to copy\n\n2. **npm not recognized:** This indicates that Node.js and npm aren't installed or properly set up in your environment. You have two options:\n\n   **Option 1: Install Node.js and npm:**\n   - Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (the LTS version is recommended)\n   - This will install both Node.js and npm\n   - After installation, restart your command prompt/terminal\n   - Verify installation by typing `node -v` and `npm -v`\n\n   **Option 2: Use the Firebase library via CDN (easier if you're not familiar with npm):**\n   - Instead of installing via npm, you can include Firebase directly in your HTML:\n   \n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.8.0/firebase-app.js\"></script>\n   <script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.8.0/firebase-firestore.js\"></script>\n   \n   <script>\n     // Your Firebase configuration\n     const firebaseConfig = {\n       apiKey: \"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n       authDomain: \"YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com\",\n       projectId: \"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\",\n       storageBucket: \"YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com\",\n       messagingSenderId: \"YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID\",\n       appId: \"YOUR_APP_ID\"\n     };\n   \n     // Initialize Firebase\n     firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n     const db = firebase.firestore();\n   </script>\n   ```\n\nSince you're encountering basic setup issues, let me suggest a simpler approach to get started:\n\n1. Focus first on just setting up the Firestore collection structure\n2. Then implement a minimal version of the metrics tracking\n3. Gradually add the more complex features once the basics are working\n\nWould you like me to provide a simplified implementation approach that doesn't require npm installation right away?"
