    " Let me trace where this method is being called. The error suggests it's still being called with 5 arguments somewhere. I need to check the `execute_collaborative_task` method: \n\nI've simplified the execution method to remove the parallel processing temporarily and fix the argument count issue. Let's also verify the `_process_feedback` method signature: \n\n\n\nI've also simplified the feedback processing to avoid potential errors. Run the test again:\n```bash\npython test_ai_system.py\n```\n\nThe changes made:\n1. Simplified execution flow to fix argument count issue\n2. Removed complex parallel processing temporarily\n3. Simplified feedback processing\n4. Fixed method signatures to match calls\n\nThis should now work without the argument count error. Let me know what output you get."
