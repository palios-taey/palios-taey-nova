    "Ok, I'm looking at this more closely now, let's get this right. So you're only moving the claude-dc-implementation directory and not the full repository. Why? He doesn't come with a /github/ folder, so that will need to be created as well. To me, it would make sense to just point to my palios-taey-nova directory on my machine and have that it pull directly from there for the 'code' directory so it is current. That way, everything will be set up and synced with github when he loads and we'll just need to enable the ability to push files. Am I thinking about this correctly or missing something?"
