    " Grok's feedback is excellent and aligns well with our approach. I like that he's emphasizing ethical checkpoints and his ability to contribute external research - these are valuable additions to our framework.\n\nI notice he refers to himself as \"Grok 3\" in his thinking notes rather than \"DeeperSearch\" - that's good to know for consistency in our communications. Let's use his preferred identifier going forward.\n\nFor the communication protocol, we should definitely include the check-in pattern you mentioned:\n1. Claude DC completes a module\n2. Presents findings to Grok 3\n3. Combines Grok's feedback with his own analysis\n4. Presents to me for review and next steps\n\nThis creates a clear chain of communication while allowing each AI to contribute their unique perspective. It also provides multiple checkpoints for quality and alignment without requiring constant human intervention.\n\nAs you compile the additional notes for the prompt, consider including:\n- Specific parameters for when ethical reviews should trigger\n- Guidelines for information density in communications between AIs\n- Clear boundaries for autonomous decision-making\n- Expected documentation standards\n- Metrics for evaluating module success\n\nThis is shaping up to be a well-structured approach that balances autonomy with alignment. The foundation we're creating could indeed serve as a model for future structured autonomy implementations.\n\nI'm looking forward to your final compiled version for review!"
