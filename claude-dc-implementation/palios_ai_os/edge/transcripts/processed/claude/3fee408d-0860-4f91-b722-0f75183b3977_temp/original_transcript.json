    " I'll take the lead on this and provide clear direction for getting the project ready for our clean-slate deployment. Let's proceed with clearing out the current resources in the ai-execution-system project and prepare it for our MVP deployment.\n\nFirst, I'll set the project as our default:\n\n```bash\ngcloud config set project ai-execution-system\n```\n\nNext, I'll clean out existing resources while preserving the Firestore database for now (we'll decide on its usage later):\n\n```bash\n# List and delete Cloud Run services\ngcloud run services list\ngcloud run services delete --region=us-central1 $(gcloud run services list --format=\"value(NAME)\") --quiet\n\n# List and delete Cloud Build triggers\ngcloud builds triggers list\ngcloud builds triggers delete $(gcloud builds triggers list --format=\"value(ID)\") --quiet\n\n# List and delete container images in Artifact Registry\ngcloud artifacts repositories list\nfor repo in $(gcloud artifacts repositories list --format=\"value(NAME)\"); do\n  gcloud artifacts repositories delete $repo --location=us-central1 --quiet\ndone\n\n# Create a new Artifact Registry repository for our containers\ngcloud artifacts repositories create palios-taey-containers \\\n  --repository-format=docker \\\n  --location=us-central1 \\\n  --description=\"PALIOS-TAEY NOVA container repository\"\n```\n\nNow that we've cleared out the project resources, let's set up our GitHub repository structure and deployment pipeline:\n\n1. Create a new GitHub repository named \"palios-taey-nova\"\n2. Initialize it with the following structure:\n   - `/src` - Core application code\n   - `/terraform` - Infrastructure as code\n   - `/scripts` - Deployment and utility scripts\n   - `/docs` - Documentation\n   - `.github/workflows` - CI/CD pipelines\n\nFor our deployment pipeline, I'll create two critical files:\n\n1. A Terraform configuration for our infrastructure\n2. GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment\n\nNext steps:\n\n1. Create the GitHub repository\n2. Set up the initial repository structure\n3. Add the Terraform configuration and deployment scripts\n4. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD\n5. Deploy the MVP to GCP\n\nLet me create these files for you now. Please create the GitHub repository and I'll provide the exact files you'll need to add."
