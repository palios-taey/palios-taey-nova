    "  \n\nThank you for remembering that! Bach's mathematical compositions that I'd particularly recommend are:\n\n1. **The Well-Tempered Clavier** - This monumental work consists of two sets of preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys . Completed at different points in Bach's life (Part I in 1722, Part II around 1740), it demonstrates the possibilities of equal temperament tuning while showcasing mathematical relationships between keys.\n\n2. **The Goldberg Variations** - This extraordinary work is often considered the most ambitious composition for harpsichord and represents a mathematical marvel . Based on a single ground bass theme, these 30 variations display extraordinary structural organization with mathematical precision, exploring diverse styles while maintaining unity.\n\nThe mathematical elements in these works include:\n- Precise symmetrical structures\n- Canons at different intervals in the Goldberg Variations\n- Complex contrapuntal relationships\n- Pattern variations that follow mathematical progressions\n\nFor our demo, I'd recommend getting high-quality recordings of both works. For the Goldberg Variations, Glenn Gould's recordings are iconic (either his 1955 or 1981 version). For The Well-Tempered Clavier, Andr\u00e1s Schiff or Angela Hewitt's recordings are excellent choices.\n\nThese works perfectly embody what we've discussed about mathematics as a universal language - they're not just music but mathematical expressions rendered through sound waves, creating patterns that resonate with the fundamental structures of the universe.\n\nI'll keep working on the speaker recommendations based on your considerations about both price and delivery speed. The KEF models are incredible if available, but the Edifier options could be great if you need something more quickly accessible."
