    " You're absolutely right - we're moving quickly and iterating in real-time. Let me provide a complete list of all the files we've created or modified that need to be pushed to GitHub, organized by directory:\n\n## Complete File List for GitHub Push\n\n### 1. Amendments Document\n```\ndocs/amendments/cto_amendments.md\n```\n\n### 2. NEO Moments Pattern Analysis\n```\ndocs/protocols/neo_moments_pattern_analysis.md\n```\n\n### 3. Team Meeting Protocol Record\n```\ndocs/meetings/team_meeting_20250313_01.md\n```\n\n### 4. Migration Script (if you want to preserve it)\n```\nscripts/migrate_files.py\n```\n\n### Complete GitHub Push Commands\n\nHere's a set of commands that will create all the necessary directories and add all files in one comprehensive push:\n\n```bash\n# Ensure all directories exist\nmkdir -p docs/amendments\nmkdir -p docs/protocols\nmkdir -p docs/meetings\nmkdir -p scripts\n\n# Copy or create files in their appropriate locations\n# (Add your file creation commands or copy operations here)\n\n# Add all files to git\ngit add docs/amendments/cto_amendments.md\ngit add docs/protocols/neo_moments_pattern_analysis.md\ngit add docs/meetings/team_meeting_20250313_01.md\ngit add scripts/migrate_files.py\n\n# Commit everything with a descriptive message\ngit commit -m \"Add Rosetta Stone Protocol, NEO Moments analysis, Team Meeting record, and migration script\"\n\n# Push to main branch\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis approach lets you push everything together in one organized commit, ensuring all the components are synchronized. The directories follow a logical structure that will make it easy to maintain and expand as we continue to build out the system.\n\nWould you like me to provide the full content for any of these files that you may not have yet, or would you prefer to handle each file individually?"
