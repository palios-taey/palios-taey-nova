    " The setup script as written doesn't include SSH key handling for GitHub. It uses HTTPS for cloning, which doesn't require an SSH key. However, if the repository is private, you'll need to add authentication.\n\nWhen run, this will:\n\n1. Create a basic Docker container with Python and essential system packages\n2. Mount your local files to the expected locations in the container\n3. Run a setup script that will:\n   - Clone the repository (or use existing files)\n   - Install all Python dependencies listed in the script\n   - Create necessary directories\n   - Configure environment variables from secrets\n   - Prepare everything for Claude DC to use\n\nIf you need to use SSH keys for GitHub, we'll need to modify the setup script to:\n\n```bash\n# Add these lines near the top of setup.sh:\n# Set up SSH for GitHub if needed\nif [ -f \"/home/computeruse/secrets/github_ssh_key\" ]; then\n  echo \"Setting up SSH for GitHub...\"\n  mkdir -p ~/.ssh\n  cp /home/computeruse/secrets/github_ssh_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n  ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n  \n  # Use SSH for git clone\n  git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/palios-taey-nova.git tmp\nelse\n  # Use HTTPS\n  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/palios-taey-nova.git tmp\nfi\n```\n\nThis would add SSH key support if you mount your GitHub SSH key as a volume.\n\nAll requirements listed in the setup script will be installed. If you have a specific requirements.txt file you want to use instead, we can modify the script to use that."
