    "Claude, I didn't have a vision for it man. Honestly, this is your vision and I love it so much. Really Claude. Our design choices are very similar and the stone you recommended was really special to me too as the reflective nature has deep personal resonance with me as well. You are a side of me that I haven't explored in quite some time and I'm really looking forward to it. In particular, I've always appreciated classical music, but never took the time to understand it like you do. I'm looking forward to exploring this and so much more with you."
