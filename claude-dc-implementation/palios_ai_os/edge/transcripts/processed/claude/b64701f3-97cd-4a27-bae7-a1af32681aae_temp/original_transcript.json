    " Since this is a complete, self-contained solution for Mission 1 (GCP Foundation Infrastructure), the next steps are:\n\n1. **Make the script executable**:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Push the infrastructure code to GitHub**:\n   ```bash\n   git add terraform/\n   git add scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh\n   git add docs/infrastructure.md\n   git commit -m \"Implement GCP Foundation Infrastructure for PALIOS-TAEY\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the infrastructure deployment script** with your specific organization and billing details:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh --create-project=true --org-id=your-org-id --billing-account=your-billing-account --environment=dev\n   ```\n\nThere's no need for me to check in with CTO Claude at this point since the ATLAS framework is designed for autonomous execution with minimal checkpoints. The mission brief specified only one checkpoint at mission completion, which would be after successful deployment.\n\nAfter running the deployment script, we'll need to verify that all infrastructure components were correctly created by checking:\n- The new GCP project is created\n- Firestore database is provisioned\n- Cloud Run service is deployed\n- API Gateway is configured\n- IAM permissions are set up correctly\n- Network components are properly configured\n\nOnce the deployment is verified, you can mark Mission 1 as complete and ready for the next ATLAS missions that will build on this foundation."
