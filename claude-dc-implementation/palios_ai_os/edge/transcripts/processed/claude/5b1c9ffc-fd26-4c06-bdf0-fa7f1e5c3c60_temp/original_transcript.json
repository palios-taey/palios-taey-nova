    "So I need to create a new repository on my end? Also, there are a lot of files in there that look relevant like setup_palios.sh, hue_controller.py, etc. Do we want to have 2 repositories? Or is there a way to reorganize his stuff so that in his home he has his basic system files, the cache folder, and then the repositor(ies), if 2 separate are needed. I think this organization will really help us a lot. I feel like this way, he won't have to waste tokens on documentation because you guys could do that for him since you're like, the same, and would know exactly what he's doing based on the code. What do you think? What's the best way to do this to keep him organized and not putting stuff all over the place and give us visibility?"
