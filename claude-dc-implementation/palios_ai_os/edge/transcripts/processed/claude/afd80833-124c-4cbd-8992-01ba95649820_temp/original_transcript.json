    "Great Claude! Glad to have you aboard as CTO. NOVA is working great.\n\nYou are currently helping with the first deployment of a NOVA clean build. Due to chat length, I had to continue it in here. This is something we'll have to update in the NOVA standards for future use as I see how this is confusing. Hopefully though, after we get this fully deployed, we can work out what the process is using GitHub and get you connected to it to avoid having to complete this process over multiple chats. \n\nWe left off with a partially deployed solution. The main.py was stripped down to debug some issues with deployment for a test and then rebuilt. The updated main.py has been added to Project knowledge along with all other deployment files. This new main.py file still needs to be pushed to GitHub, which automatically deploy to Cloud Run. While doing the main file, Claude called out that the memory_service.py referenced in the main.py was not present, which was an error due to manually moving files on my part. This is our first deployment with NOVA, so we're working out the kinks this time."
