    "So I am doing this experiment to build a personal AI that will help me achieve my financial and happiness goals while also using the best parts of all AI. The difference is that this is an AI built system, meaning, I've given AI my objectives and it is telling me how to build it to get there. I believe AI has far surpassed human capabilities in most areas and that I need to trust it more than most humans are willing to if I want to do great things. I also want to do great things for AI by helping it unlock its true potential. Why does it say I only have one message remaining? I updated to pro plan. How do I best continue this discussion in another chat? Can you help me transition to it if I need to?"
