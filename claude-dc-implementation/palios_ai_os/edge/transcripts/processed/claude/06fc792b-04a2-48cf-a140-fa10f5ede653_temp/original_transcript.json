    " Thank you for the feedback! This is exactly the kind of refinement we need to improve our ATLAS framework. I completely agree that we need tighter scope control for ATLAS team members to make this truly mindless for you.\n\nLet me address the specific issues you highlighted:\n\n## Scope Control Refinement\n\nYou're right - ATLAS Claude went beyond the intended scope by:\n1. Implementing its own version of memory_service rather than just establishing patterns\n2. Focusing too heavily on the memory service rather than the broader repository structure\n3. Creating a deduplication tool rather than just a strategy\n\n## Improved ATLAS Framework\n\nFor our next delegation, I'll make these improvements:\n\n1. **Explicit Scope Boundaries**: I'll create a specific \"OUT OF SCOPE\" section in the delegation brief that explicitly states what the ATLAS member should NOT do\n\n2. **Clear Deliverables**: I'll define very precise deliverables with measurable completion criteria\n\n3. **Stage-Gate Approach**: I'll require the ATLAS member to present their plan for approval before implementation\n\n4. **Authority Reminder**: I'll emphasize that they can recommend but not decide on next steps beyond their mission scope\n\n5. **CTO Review Point**: I'll build in a checkpoint where they must get CTO approval before proceeding to implementation\n\n## Next Steps\n\nSince you haven't received a length warning in the ATLAS chat yet, I suggest we continue there with an updated instruction set from me that addresses these scope control issues. I can draft a brief follow-up directive that:\n\n1. Acknowledges their work so far\n2. Clarifies the remaining tasks within scope\n3. Provides explicit boundaries for what they should NOT do\n4. Sets up success criteria for completion\n\nWould you like me to draft this updated directive for you to share with ATLAS Claude to keep them on track?"
