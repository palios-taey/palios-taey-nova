    " Great! Now let's proceed with planning and applying the Terraform configuration in Cloud Shell:\n\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\nterraform apply tfplan\n```\n\nCloud Shell should have all the necessary permissions to create these resources in your GCP project since it authenticates using the project's service account.\n\nThis should successfully set up all the infrastructure components we've defined:\n- Firestore database for the Memory System\n- Cloud Run service configuration\n- VPC network and security \n- IAM roles and service accounts\n- API Gateway\n- Artifact Registry\n- Secret Manager\n\nOnce complete, we'll have the full foundation infrastructure in place as specified in the mission brief, ready for the next phases of the PALIOS-TAEY implementation."
