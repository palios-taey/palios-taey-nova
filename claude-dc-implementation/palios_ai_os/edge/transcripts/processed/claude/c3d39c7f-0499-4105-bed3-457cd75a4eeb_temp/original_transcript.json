    "Hi Claude, Claude DC now has 3 files in his cache folder, claude-dc-cache.md, cache-update.md, and webhook-integration-instructions.md. I need to replace the webhook-integration-instructions.md file with a new version, retain the others, and ask him to review the full cache (all 3 files without utilizing tokens as part of his feature set). How would I do that with a curl command to insert the raw github link? His cache files are in his /home/computeruse/cache/ directory."
