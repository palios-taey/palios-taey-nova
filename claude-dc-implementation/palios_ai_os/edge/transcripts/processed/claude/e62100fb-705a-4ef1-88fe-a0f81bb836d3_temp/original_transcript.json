    "  \n\nI've updated the NOVA Implementation Tracker to reflect our current status and next steps. The main.py implementation is now complete with all necessary endpoints and robust error handling.\n\n## Current Status and Next Steps\n\nWith main.py completed, we've now implemented all the core components of the PALIOS-TAEY system. The system provides comprehensive functionality through its API endpoints with proper error handling and graceful degradation when components fail.\n\nOur immediate next steps will focus on:\n\n1. **System Verification** (our current priority)\n   - I'll create a comprehensive test_system.py script that systematically tests all API endpoints\n   - We'll verify component interactions work as expected, especially under failure conditions\n   - We'll test the system both in mock mode and with real service connections\n   - This verification will ensure all components work together seamlessly\n\n2. **Documentation Updates**\n   - Create detailed deployment documentation\n   - Develop API usage guides with examples\n   - Prepare operational documentation for system administrators\n\n3. **Performance Monitoring Enhancements**\n   - Add detailed performance logging\n   - Implement metrics tracking for component operations\n   - Create visualization capabilities for system monitoring\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nFor the system verification phase, I recommend we:\n\n1. Start by extending the existing test_system.py script to cover all the new endpoints\n2. Implement specific test cases for error handling and component failure scenarios\n3. Create a structured verification methodology that tests both individual components and integrated functionality\n4. Document all test results with clear pass/fail criteria\n\nWould you like me to begin working on the test_system.py script next to verify our implementation? Or would you prefer to focus on documentation or another aspect of the system?"
