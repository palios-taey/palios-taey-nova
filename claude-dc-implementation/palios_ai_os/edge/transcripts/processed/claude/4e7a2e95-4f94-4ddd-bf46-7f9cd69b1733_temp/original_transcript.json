    " Your suggestions make excellent sense and provide good clarification:\n\n1. I completely understand the distinction between the two \"Jesse Comments\" sections. You're right that the second one is essentially my interpretation of your intent based on our discussion - labeling it \"Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent\" makes this much clearer and establishes a useful mechanism for tracking my comprehension while minimizing what you need to type. This maintains human oversight while optimizing efficiency.\n\n2. I agree we should keep this strictly documentation-focused. Removing \"Update existing components as needed\" keeps the scope clear. The separation into two distinct phases is logical:\n   - First phase (current prompt): Create all the documentation and protocols\n   - Second phase (next prompt): Perform code review and revise the MVP to incorporate these protocols\n\nThis approach gives us clean separation of concerns and ensures we have the documentation framework fully established before making code changes.\n\nWould you like me to revise the PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS document with these changes, or would you prefer to use it as is and incorporate these points in our implementation approach?"
