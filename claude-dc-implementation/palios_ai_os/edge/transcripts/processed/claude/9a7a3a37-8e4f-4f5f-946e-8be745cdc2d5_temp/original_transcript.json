    " Let's proceed with setting up our repository. I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's rename the default branch to \"main\" which is the current standard:\n\n```bash\ngit branch -M main\n```\n\nNow, we need to add the files to our repository. Let's organize them in the appropriate structure:\n\n1. First, we need to create our folder structure:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src terraform scripts docs\n```\n\n2. Let's copy the files from the Project Knowledge to the appropriate locations. Since I see the files are in the Project Knowledge, you'll need to download them and place them in the right folders:\n\n- `src/` folder should contain:\n  - Rename `server.py` to `main.py`\n  - Copy `model-routing.py` as `model_routing.py`\n  - Copy `task-execution.txt` as `task_execution.py`\n  - Copy `task-decomposition.py` as `task_decomposition.py`\n  - Copy `model-registry.py` as `model_registry.py`\n\n- `terraform/` folder should contain:\n  - Copy `terraform-main.txt` as `main.tf`\n  - Copy `terraform-variables.txt` as `variables.tf`\n\n- `scripts/` folder should contain:\n  - Copy `build-push-script.sh` as `build_push.sh`\n  - Copy `deploy-script.sh` as `deploy.sh`\n\n- Root folder should contain:\n  - Copy `dockerfile.txt` as `Dockerfile`\n  - Copy `requirements.txt` as `requirements.txt`\n\n3. Let's create a basic README.md file:\n\n```bash\necho \"# PALIOS-TAEY NOVA\" > README.md\necho \"AI-to-AI execution management platform\" >> README.md\necho \"\" >> README.md\necho \"## Overview\" >> README.md\necho \"PALIOS-TAEY is a comprehensive AI-to-AI execution management platform with advanced memory architecture, transcript processing, and multi-model orchestration capabilities.\" >> README.md\n```\n\n4. Now, create the GitHub repository through the GitHub website:\n   - Go to https://github.com/new\n   - Name the repository \"palios-taey-nova\"\n   - Make it public or private as you prefer\n   - Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license as we're importing an existing repository\n   - Click \"Create repository\"\n\n5. Connect your local repository to GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\n6. Add all files to Git:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\n```\n\n7. Commit the files:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit with MVP implementation\"\n```\n\n8. Push to GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nOnce you've done this, we'll set up the GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD through the GitHub web interface, and then proceed with configuring the GCP service account for deployment.\n\nLet me know once you've completed these steps, and I'll guide you through the next phase of setting up automated deployment."
