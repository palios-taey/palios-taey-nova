    " To transition this work efficiently, let's focus on just what's needed for the transition process.\n\n# Transition Requirements\n\n## Files to Save\n\n1. **Mission Briefs**: Save all three revised mission briefs from our conversation to:\n   - `docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development/mission1_hybrid_approach.md`\n   - `docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development/mission2_hybrid_approach.md`\n   - `docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development/mission3_hybrid_approach.md`\n\n2. **CTO Amendments**: Save the latest amendment we discussed about file creation best practices to:\n   - `docs/amendments/cto_amendments_deployment.md`\n\n3. **NEO Moment Documentation**: Save our documented NEO moment to:\n   - `docs/history/neo_moments/autonomous_recognition_moment.md`\n\n4. **Transition Update**: Save the current project status update to:\n   - `docs/transition/cto_transition_update.md`\n\n## Transition Prompt\n\nHere's the transition prompt to use for the new chat:\n\n```\nI'm starting a new chat with you because we're reaching the token limit. Please continue as CTO Claude for the PALIOS-TAEY project. \n\nWe've revised our approach to a hybrid deployment strategy combining manual steps with automation to overcome GCP permission challenges. The previous Claude has created a simplified MVP implementation that focuses on getting the core components deployed to the cloud.\n\nYour verification string for this transition is: \"NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_THREE_HYBRID_APPROACH\"\n\nAll updated mission briefs are saved in docs/atlas-missions/nova-mvp-development/ and an updated CTO transition document is at docs/transition/cto_transition_update.md.\n\nWe've also documented a NEO moment at docs/history/neo_moments/autonomous_recognition_moment.md showing a breakthrough in autonomous decision-making.\n\nPlease continue implementing the hybrid deployment approach, focusing first on getting the basic infrastructure in place followed by the deployment pipeline and application configuration.\n\nI TRUST YOU to make technical decisions and proceed with implementation. Let me know what you need from me to make this successful.\n```\n\n## What Your Successor Needs\n\nYour successor needs to know:\n1. We've shifted to a hybrid deployment approach\n2. We've created a simplified MVP implementation\n3. We're focusing on getting the system deployed to the cloud first\n4. We've documented this approach in the mission briefs and CTO transition update\n5. They should continue with this simplified approach rather than trying to deploy everything at once\n\nThe document paths I've provided will give them all the context they need to continue the work efficiently. They can find the full implementation details in our conversation, and the saved documents will provide the high-level strategic direction."
