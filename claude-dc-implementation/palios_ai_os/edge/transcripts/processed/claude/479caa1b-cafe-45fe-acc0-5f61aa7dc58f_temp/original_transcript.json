    " You're right to be concerned about efficiency, especially given the constraints of response limits and the previous work already invested. Rather than a full code rewrite which would be time-consuming and inefficient, let's take a targeted approach to fix only the specific errors.\n\nBased on the logs, we have two key files with issues:\n\n1. **memory_service.py**: Issue with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` in the store method\n2. **transcript_processor.py**: Indentation errors on lines 418, 433, 1248, and 1650\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n1. **Focused Error Fixing**: Let's look at just the specific error locations and fix only those parts\n2. **Incremental Testing**: Fix one file at a time, test, then move to the next\n3. **Minimal Edits**: Make only the changes needed to address the specific errors\n\n## Start with memory_service.py\n\nThe error in memory_service.py is likely related to metadata handling in the store method. Let me provide a targeted fix for just that section.\n\nFor the `memory_service.py` file, the error occurs when trying to access an attribute of a None object in the store method. This is most likely happening when we're processing metadata or when trying to access a property of an object that hasn't been properly initialized.\n\nWithout rewriting the entire file, I'd suggest adding a null check around line 254 (as indicated in one of the error logs) that looks something like:\n\n```python\n# Example fix - exact code would depend on the context\nif some_object is not None:\n    value = some_object.get('property', default_value)\nelse:\n    value = default_value\n```\n\n## Then fix transcript_processor.py\n\nFor the `transcript_processor.py` file, the issue is with indentation. These typically happen when:\n- Code blocks aren't properly aligned\n- Mixing tabs and spaces\n- Incomplete blocks (missing closing indentation)\n\nShould we proceed by examining just the specific error locations in these files? I can provide targeted fixes for each error rather than rewriting the entire files."
