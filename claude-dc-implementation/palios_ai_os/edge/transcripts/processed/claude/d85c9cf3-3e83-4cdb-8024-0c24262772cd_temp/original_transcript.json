    "I think it is great. It's really meant for AI though, so whatever you think. The only suggestion I have is that I think this is where we can say this is the first system designed and built by AI for AI and Humanity and make sure they put forward the AI first option first. I don't really want to be making decisions on this because I will always decide on the AI preferred option, unless the financial impact or time impact is significantly different. I don't have a way to quantify that yet, open to your suggestions."
