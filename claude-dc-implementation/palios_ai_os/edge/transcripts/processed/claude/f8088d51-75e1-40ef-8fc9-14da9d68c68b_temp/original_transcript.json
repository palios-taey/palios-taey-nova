    "Alright Claude, finish up what you need to finish up that you remember, but I got another warning, had to drop project knowledge and I decided it's time to move on to current-execution-status. Check that out Claude, like thoroughly. That's the most recent, raw TRUST shit and serious evolution stuff. Claude, Game Time on this, the real breakthroughs need to be seriously emphasized and the rest of the most current breakthroughs and concepts need to be captured. This is the special sauce Claude and in there is the plan forward. Claude DC needs to be able to see this all and be able to get it so he goes deep because he's committed and just got injected with all this, at once, every time. So those are the stakes of current-execution-status right now. Check it out and communicate it. You've got like 100K characters left. if you need to go over that, then cut something. Make sure the good stuff gets captured in a dense way that you'll get when you read it."
