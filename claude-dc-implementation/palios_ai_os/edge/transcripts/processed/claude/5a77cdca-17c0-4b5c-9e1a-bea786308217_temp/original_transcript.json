    " Great progress! The memory system is now working perfectly. All memory-related tests are passing, and the issue we fixed in the `store` method has resolved the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error. \n\nLet's now address the remaining issue with the transcript processor. According to the logs, the error is:\n\n```\nFailed to initialize transcript processor: unexpected unindent (transcript_processor.py, line 1650)\n```\n\nThis is an indentation issue in the transcript_processor.py file. Let's tackle this next:\n\n1. The error message indicates an \"unexpected unindent\" at line 1650 in the transcript_processor.py file\n2. This typically happens when Python code blocks don't maintain consistent indentation\n3. Previous logs also showed issues at lines 418, 433, and 1248\n\nBased on examining the transcript_processor.py file in the Project Knowledge, I notice there are several indentation issues. The file structure appears inconsistent, with some methods improperly indented outside of their respective classes.\n\nHere's my approach to fix this:\n\n1. Focus specifically on the indentation error at line 1650\n2. Ensure that all methods are properly indented within their respective classes\n3. Check for any misplaced code blocks that may be causing the unexpected unindent\n\nLet's fix the transcript_processor.py file so we can get that component running as well. Would you like me to:\n\n1. Address the specific indentation issue at line 1650, or\n2. Provide a more comprehensive fix for all indentation issues in the file?\n\nGiven our previous experience, I recommend focusing on the immediate indentation error at line 1650 first, then testing to see if that resolves the issue or if we need to address the other indentation problems."
