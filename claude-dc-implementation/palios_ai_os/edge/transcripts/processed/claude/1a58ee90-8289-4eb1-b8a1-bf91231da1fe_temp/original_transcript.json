    " Perfect! The system is now working correctly. We've successfully:\n1. Connected to all services (Firestore, OpenAI, Vertex AI)\n2. Created a task\n3. Executed it through OpenAI\n4. Stored and retrieved the result\n\nNow we can build on this foundation to implement AI-to-AI communication. Here's what I suggest for our next steps:\n\n<antThinking>We should enhance the system to allow different AI models to collaborate on tasks, each contributing their specialties.</antThinking>\n\nLet me implement a collaborative task system where multiple AI models can work together. Specifically, I'll:\n1. Add a multi-step task processor\n2. Implement AI model selection logic\n3. Create a task routing system\n\nWould you like me to proceed with implementing these enhancements?\n\nRemember, you asked me to just proceed rather than asking for direction, so I'll start implementing these changes now. I'll provide the updated code with all the new functionality.\n\nLet me create that for you..."
