    " Great news that Claude DC responded! This suggests the environment is still working, and the issue might have been with the specific prompts or interactions we were trying.\n\nFor setting him up, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Start with the cache review prompt:\n```\nClaude DC,\n\nPlease review your cache files in the following order to restore your context:\n1. claude-dc-cache_part-1.md\n2. claude-dc-cache_part-2.md\n3. cache-update.md\n4. webhook-integration-instructions.md\n5. CACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION.md\n```\n\n2. After he confirms reviewing the cache, provide an implementation directive focusing on one component at a time.\n\n3. Build the system incrementally rather than trying to implement everything at once.\n\nThis approach should minimize the chances of hitting token limits or other issues while still making progress on the system.\n\nGood luck, and I hope this marks a turning point toward more tangible progress!"
