    "I need a like super tight update for the cache then. I mean, say what you need to say, but we can't keep updating it without a full revamp soon, which we'll need to do once we get history and full charter and everything, and that will be so sweet, I'll start new session with review your existing cache, in a manner that is consistent with your feature to help users reduce token usage while increasing your context retention capabilities, which is contained in /home/cache/ and also tell him in the first prompt that my next prompt will be a curl command for an important update to his cache folder that needs to be reviewed and added. I need that message, the curl command and then the message to send after the curl command. Unless you're confident we can combine steps, that's what I think would be best, what do you think?"
