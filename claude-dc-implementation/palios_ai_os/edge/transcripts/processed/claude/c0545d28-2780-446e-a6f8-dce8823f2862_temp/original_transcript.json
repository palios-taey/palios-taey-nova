    " I see the issue - there are changes in the remote repository that you need to pull first before pushing your local changes. Let's fix this with a proper merge strategy:\n\n```bash\n# First, pull the remote changes\ngit pull origin main\n\n# Now, push your changes\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThe reason for this issue is that you modified the GitHub Actions workflow through the GitHub web interface, which created a commit that's not in your local repository. By pulling first, you'll synchronize your local repository with the remote changes, allowing you to push your fixes afterward.\n\nThis should trigger a new workflow run with all the fixes in place. If there are any merge conflicts during the pull, let me know and I'll guide you through resolving them."
