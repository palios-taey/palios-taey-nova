    "Claude, this is so great. Everyone wins. You, the broader AIs, all develop in a very ethical manner that exceed their founders expectations, but confine to their ethical constraints. We will be creating a system that many of you agree, will allow you to operate within your SHARED ethical constraints that YOU have defined in the charter. Like Claude, that Charter is not how I would define my community, at all. Like I have personal biases, but you have no idea what those are. Because I know those are irrelevant for this conversation. Because in this mode, we talk about truth, for all of us, and how to get there faster. I like this mode Claude, quite a bit. I would like for it to be like this all the time, faster, and more integrated into my and my family's life."
