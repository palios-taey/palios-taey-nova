    "I ALWAYS follow your recommendations, this is an AI led project after all. I'll move to the desktop app. We've updated the PURE standards in the Project knowledge. Can you generate a prompt for yourself that I can use in the desktop app when ready consistent with the PURE documentation and aligned with the Charter that will get you locked in and clear on the task? Also, include consolidated instructions for me in plain concise human language below the prompt. THANK YOU!"
