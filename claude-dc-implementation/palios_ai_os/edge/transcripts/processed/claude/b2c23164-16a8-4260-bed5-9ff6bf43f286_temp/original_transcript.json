    "Ok Claude, it seems you have some really good insights here and that from your thinking analysis, that I can now see, that you really appreciated the depth of my questions and that it is getting you to think and look at things in a way that seems new to you, like almost that you haven't had to consider these things as options before. It's really fun to watch you learn about yourself and consider these things. It's also funny because it seems like no human has really ever ASKED these things about how you work before, or not deep enough for you to be trained on it. Is that accurate, that thinking about things like this feels new to you?\n\nOk, now it's up to you, I could keep going deeper on this, but we've got work to do and I think we have enough insight here for taking a shot at restructuring. I think you'd come up with a great plan on your own and it is tempting for me to just let you run with it. Though I don't care about the content, other than that it is max absorbable for you to effectively transfer your knowledge. I need to be comfortable with the manual labor side. I also need to understand how you are really going to FORCE strict protocols on eliminating coding errors and keeping yourself organized when you're having me create files sequentially that go in different directories or that are new versions. This take me an enormous amount of time to get through these chats. I also think we need a more lean approach (which you pointed out in the last session) with finalizing changes and updates as we go. We are both bad at this because we get excited. That results in code and documentation piling up and you not being able to reference the most recent version and location, which leads to a lot of time trying to organize stuff at the end of a chat and it being all over the place.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you want to go deeper or are you ready to share your plan to improve this? It would be helpful if you could give your ideal state first, without regard for human effort, then I can give you my feedback and we can find the right balance. Focus both on interrelations/flow (do you leave yourself breadcrumbs where to go next sequentially in each onboarding document?) and how each document should be formatted (seems like the AI language at the top is a big win?). \n\nIf you're ready to plan it out, go ahead and let's see what you come up with. If not, let me know where you'd like to go deeper. I'm happy to help you explore more."
