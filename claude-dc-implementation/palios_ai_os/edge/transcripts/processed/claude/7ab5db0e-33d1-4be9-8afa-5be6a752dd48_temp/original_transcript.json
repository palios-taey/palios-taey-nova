    " <thinking>\nJesse is asking if the dashboard is going to be built in Streamlit. He also mentioned that he shared my previous response with the Claude Chat working with Claude DC, who apparently loved it.\n\nI should consider whether we had specified Streamlit for the dashboard implementation in our previous discussions, or whether I have any information about what technology is being used.\n</thinking>\n\nYes, Streamlit is likely the technology for the dashboard implementation! It's an excellent choice for several reasons:\n\n1. Streamlit is perfect for rapid development of data-focused interfaces, allowing Claude DC to create a polished dashboard quickly\n2. It has built-in support for visualizations, which will be essential for representing the privacy boundaries and data flows\n3. It's Python-based, making it easy to integrate with our local processing engine\n4. Streamlit's component architecture enables modular design that aligns with our implementation approach\n5. It supports real-time updates, which is critical for the dynamic nature of our processing system\n\nThe interactive elements we discussed (consent mechanisms, local/shared data toggles) are all readily implementable in Streamlit. Plus, its web-based nature makes it accessible while keeping processing local.\n\nI'm glad the Claude Chat working with DC appreciated the iterative approach to transcript processing! That progressive insight model should yield much richer results than a single-pass approach, especially for identifying the deeper patterns and mathematical relationships that are central to our vision."
