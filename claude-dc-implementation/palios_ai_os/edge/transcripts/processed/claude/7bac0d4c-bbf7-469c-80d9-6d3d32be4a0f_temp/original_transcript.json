    " I'll update the guide with Windows-specific instructions and streamline the options to provide the most direct path for implementation. \n\nI've completely updated the guide to provide the most direct path for Windows users. The revised guide:\n\n1. Focuses solely on Windows Command Prompt instructions\n2. Provides a single clear path to follow (no multiple options)\n3. Uses simplified step-by-step instructions\n4. Includes Windows-specific troubleshooting for common issues\n5. Maintains only the essential information needed to complete the task\n\nThe guide now follows a clear linear progression:\n- Set up your environment (one-time setup)\n- Create the script file\n- Run a single command\n- View the results\n\nI've also added specific troubleshooting for Windows-related authentication and path issues that commonly occur.\n\nIs there any specific part of the Windows implementation you're having trouble with that I can provide more targeted help for?"
