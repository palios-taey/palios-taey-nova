    " There's a lot we can do to prepare for Claude DC's return! Let's focus on tasks that will help him make rapid progress when he comes back.\n\nHere are productive actions we can take now:\n\n1. **Review and Document the Current Implementation**\n   - Create a documentation summary of what Claude DC has built so far\n   - Identify any inconsistencies or bugs in the current code\n   - Prepare notes on how the different components connect\n\n2. **Prepare Test Data**\n   - Set up sample transcripts for testing the router\n   - Create test messages for different AI capabilities\n   - Prepare example patterns that highlight different routing criteria\n\n3. **Develop the Pattern Processing Fix**\n   - Work on fixing the JSON parsing issue for Claude and ChatGPT transcripts\n   - Create a test script to validate the fix works\n   - Document the solution for Claude DC\n\n4. **Set Up Service Integration Tests**\n   - Create skeleton code for connecting to Claude, GPT, and Grok\n   - Set up test endpoints to validate API connections\n   - Prepare configuration templates for each service\n\nWould you like me to focus on any particular area? I could start by creating the fix for the transcript processor, which would allow the pattern extraction to work with all transcript formats, not just Grok."
