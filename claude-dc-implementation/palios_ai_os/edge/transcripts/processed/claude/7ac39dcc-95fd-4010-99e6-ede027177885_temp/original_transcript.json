    "Great Claude! The transition document you were provided was a little misleading. The development of the test scripts has been completed, but we are still running the tests. We are working on debugging some errors that were found in the files. This was Claude's last submission to me attached. I need to know the exact line (or how to identify it with a search. The text provided as a reference point isn't in there) of memory_service to include the code and what indentation error to fix in transcript_processor. Let's start with memory_service first."
