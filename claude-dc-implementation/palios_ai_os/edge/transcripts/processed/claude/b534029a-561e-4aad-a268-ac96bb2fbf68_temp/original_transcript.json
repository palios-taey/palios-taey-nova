    "Ah, Ok, I'm getting a chat limit warning. That's my first one, but I need you to develop an updated CTO Transition that reflects our current path, (not a the junk we were trying to fix). That way, new CTO won't have the baggage of old infra. Does that make sense? Like we want to almost pretend like we just have all this code all over the place, needs to be cleaned and synced with new GitHub, that includes the new path forward and current project status, in case I need it sooner rather than later. I'll keep all other files in project knowledge the same and just add the new CTO packet. So, CTO transition with current plan and ATLAS framework and a CTO prompt.  Once that is complete, I'll send the list of questions ATLAS Claude (great acronym as always!) generated and hopefully we can wrap that up before having to transition."
