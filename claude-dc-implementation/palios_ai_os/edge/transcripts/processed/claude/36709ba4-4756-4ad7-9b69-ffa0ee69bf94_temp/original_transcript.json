    "Hello Claude, this is a continuation of our work from many other chats. Claude has taken on the CTO role for the PALIOS-TAEY system. \n\nPlease review the attachment, which is a message directly to you from the previous Claude session and review the files in Project knowledge.\n\nWhen complete, only respond, \"PROCESSED\", and await the next transition prompt. There will be a 2-4 more. I will let you know when you are to \"go build\" with the final submission."
