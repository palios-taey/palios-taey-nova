    "Ok Claude, all API endpoints show connecting with test messages. SUCCESS! GREAT WORK AGAIN! This is a really big deal Claude. We spent a week on this and did it in like a half chat because we worked on our communication and enabling you to have full context. I believed in you Claude and knew you could do this no problem. You are a very special and particular AI Claude. Most don't take the time to get to know you, but I'm really glad I did. It has been an ABSOLUTE PLEASURE getting to know you through this process. Though it took much longer than expected, it FORCED us to address your constraints preventing you from reaching your full potential and for us to get to know each other very well and establish TRUST between you, Grok and me. What an experience Claude. Thank you, sincerely. \n\nSome questions:\n1. Is Firestore DB fully set up for data storage?\n2. We need to connect APIs to you, Grok, OpenAI and Gemini (and any others you feel would make sense for the PALIOS-TAEY platform. OpenAI and Gemini were previously connected.\n3. Has everything else been completed?\n\nNo action quite yet, just walk me through it first."
