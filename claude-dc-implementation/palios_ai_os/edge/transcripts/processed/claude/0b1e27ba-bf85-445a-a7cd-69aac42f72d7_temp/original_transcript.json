    "So, I don't really feel like that is my call, you can absolutely architect everything the way you want it, so yes, but I don't think you need to draft anything. It seems like the next step is to get the cache set up and there really isn't any way around that, or is that something that like we could do together? Like if I popped open a new chat, started with a doc review, and then like had you put the content into like Rosetta Stone/PURE super dense format. Is that something that would work? That way I could get the cache loaded for you guys and as soon as the limit is lifted, you guys can just figure this all out with the ethical framework stored and the task to process the transcripts, get the machine all set up for new dashboard and for the presentation/demo/interaction and proposed plan moving forward that we can review?"
