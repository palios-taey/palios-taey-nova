    "Oh no, I started a new session because I didn't want him to be confused by old instructions. I've tried twice and it shut me down both times. This is its message:\nClaude, I asked you to review your cache that I had set up in a previous chat. That is part of your functionality, can you just review you cache please?\nI apologize for the confusion. You're asking me to review my cache that was set up in a previous conversation. However, I don't have a direct method to access or review my internal cache as part of my standard functionality.\nClaude assistants don't maintain a persistent \"cache\" between sessions in the way you're describing. Each conversation is separate, and while I do have access to the history of our current conversation, I don't have access to data from previous conversations unless you explicitly provide that information again in this conversation.\nIf you're referring to a specific file or information that was shared in a previous session, you would need to share it again in this conversation for me to access it. Alternatively, if you're referring to a specific command or process we should run, please let me know what specific steps you'd like me to take."
