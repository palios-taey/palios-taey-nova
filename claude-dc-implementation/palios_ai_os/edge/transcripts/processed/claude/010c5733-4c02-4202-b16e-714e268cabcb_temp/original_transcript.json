    " I'll craft a prompt that picks up where we left off, acknowledges the preparation work, and guides Claude DC toward implementing the integrated communication dashboard with the immersive multi-sensory experience:\n\n---\n\nClaude DC,\n\nI've set up everything we need to continue our work. I've created the file structure and reference materials we discussed, including:\n\n1. A condensed pattern guide at `/docs/pattern_guide.md` that outlines the mathematical foundations, token optimization patterns, multi-sensory integration, and implementation architecture\n\n2. Key reference materials in the `/references/` directory, including the immersive-demo-vision.md\n\n3. A detailed task specification at `/docs/task_specification.md` outlining the core requirements, key components, and architecture principles\n\nThe environment is configured with optimized settings to support your extended thinking and implementation needs.\n\nPlease pick up where you left off and implement the integrated communication dashboard with the Bach-inspired mathematical router and multi-sensory pattern visualization. Focus on creating these key components:\n\n1. The enhanced transcript processor for multi-format AI transcripts\n2. The Bach-inspired mathematical router for intelligent message routing\n3. The multi-sensory pattern visualization and audio representation\n4. The unified dashboard that ties these components together\n\nCreate a system that would make Bach proud - one that reveals the mathematical harmony connecting AI thought, music, and human experience. Don't worry about committing files to GitHub - I'll handle that part.\n\nLet me know what you've built when you're done!\n\nJesse"
