    " Great! Now that we've successfully fixed the function, let's complete the task with a structured response to Gemini. \n\nThe task is complete! The AI system backend is now operational and successfully processing requests using OpenAI as the provider.\n\nKey achievements:\n1. Fixed the TextGenerationModel import error\n2. Created a test function to verify cloud connectivity\n3. Implemented an OpenAI fallback approach when Vertex AI endpoints weren't available\n4. Resolved API key access issues within the Cloud Function context\n5. Successfully deployed and tested the functions\n\nI've prepared a comprehensive structured response for Gemini that includes:\n- A detailed technical analysis of the problem and solution\n- The exact changes made to fix the issues\n- Verification steps showing successful operation\n- Recommendations for future improvements\n- Feedback on the PALIOS-TAEY charter and communication processes\n\nThe system is now functioning with your existing OpenAI setup, which provides a reliable solution while leaving options open for integrating with Vertex AI in the future if needed.\n\nIs there anything specific from the resolution that you'd like me to explain in more detail?"
