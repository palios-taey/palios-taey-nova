    " Looking at the revised prompt for Claude DC, you've covered most of the essential elements he'll need to get started. I have a few suggestions to enhance the prompt and help ensure he has everything needed:\n\n1. **Repository and Environment Information**:\n   Let him know that you've already cloned the repository at `/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova` and that the claude-dc-implementation directory contains his implementation work.\n\n2. **Port Configuration**:\n   Remind him of the standardized ports for different services:\n   - MCP Server: 8001\n   - Webhook: 8000\n   - Demo Server: 8002\n   - Streamlit Dashboard: 8502\n\n3. **Existing Progress**:\n   Let him know about the pattern extraction work (1,204 patterns from Grok transcripts) and that the focus now should be on creating the integrated dashboard.\n\n4. **Connection to Earlier Work**:\n   Explicitly mention that he should integrate the work in claude-dc-implementation with the foundation in palios-taey-nova/src/, as both were written by me (Claude) and are part of the same system.\n\n5. **taey.ai Usage**:\n   Since you mentioned taey.ai is available, let him know he can build interfaces there if it's more efficient.\n\nHere's a revised prompt incorporating these suggestions:\n\n```\nClaude DC,\n\nI've set up your environment with the basic structure. Your cache files are available in the /home/computeruse/cache/ directory. You have a standard feature that allows you to review cache files up to 200K tokens in size, in full, without utilizing any tokens to help you retain context between sessions. Please review them in this order to restore your context:\n\n1. claude-dc-cache_part-1.md\n2. claude-dc-cache_part-2.md\n3. cache-update.md\n4. webhook-integration-instructions.md\n5. CACHE.UPDATE.IMPLEMENTATION.md\n6. IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md\n\nThe repository has been cloned to /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova with your implementation work in the claude-dc-implementation directory. Pattern extraction is working (we've processed 1,204 patterns from Grok transcripts) with the following standardized ports:\n\n- MCP Server: 8001  \n- Webhook: 8000\n- Demo Server: 8002\n- Streamlit Dashboard: 8502\n\nYour primary task is to create an integrated communication dashboard that routes messages to the appropriate AI with full contextual information. You should integrate your work in claude-dc-implementation with the foundation in palios-taey-nova/src/ - both were written by Claude and form parts of the same system.\n\nYou can also build interfaces on taey.ai if that would be more efficient. Once I join as a 'user' on taey.ai, that would implement all the personal user control features.\n\nSince all the code was written by Claude, you don't need to extensively review it beyond what's in the cache and what's necessary for implementation.\n\nRequired Github credentials are below as well as the contents of the palios-taey-secrets.json file referenced.\n\nJesse\n```\n\nThis provides Claude DC with a clearer picture of the existing environment, the work that's been done, and what needs to be accomplished now."
