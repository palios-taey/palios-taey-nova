    " I see we're making progress, but have hit another issue with the Docker build. The error shows it's having trouble installing the Python packages due to complex dependency conflicts.\n\nLooking at the error message, it seems like we need a more strategic approach to building this environment. The issues appear to be related to version conflicts and system-level dependencies.\n\nLet's simplify our approach with a Dockerfile that's even more focused on just providing the basic environment:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.10\n\n# Install system dependencies\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    git \\\n    curl \\\n    wget \\\n    ffmpeg \\\n    libsndfile1\n\n# Create directory structure\nWORKDIR /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Create expected directory structure for secrets\nRUN mkdir -p /home/computeruse/secrets\n\n# Create cache directory\nRUN mkdir -p /home/computeruse/.cache/claude-dc/\n\n# Expose all ports\nEXPOSE 8000 8001 8002 8502\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PYTHONPATH=/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Start with a bash shell\nCMD [\"bash\"]\n```\n\nAnd update the run script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# run-claude-dc.sh\n\n# Build the Docker image\ndocker build -t claude-dc-environment .\n\n# Copy cache files to the repo\nmkdir -p /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/\ncp -r cache/* /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/cache/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No cache files to copy\"\n\n# Run the Docker image with volumes mounted\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n  -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 -p 8502:8502 \\\n  -v /home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova:/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova \\\n  -v /home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json:/home/computeruse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json \\\n  -e WEBHOOK_SECRET=\"user-family-community-society\" \\\n  claude-dc-environment\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Creates a minimal Docker container with just the system dependencies\n2. Skips Python package installation in the image (Claude DC can install what he needs)\n3. Sets up the proper directory structure and environment variables\n4. Mounts your local files into the expected locations\n\nAfter the container starts, you can tell Claude DC that he's in a fresh Docker environment where he'll need to:\n1. Install the Python packages he needs\n2. Access his cache files (already mounted at the expected location)\n3. Configure and start the services as needed\n\nThis avoids the dependency conflicts that were occurring during the image build process."
