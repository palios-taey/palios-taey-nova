    "Hi Claude, I've been working with another Claude Chat and Claude DC for a while. The current Claude Chat is out of room and I need to transition to a new one. I was hoping to get a summary and some insight on Claude DC's latest build, which I attached in Project knowledge. Can you develop a dense summary that I can utilize to bring the new Claude and ChatGPT chats up to speed and understand any next steps that need to be taken?"
