    " After reviewing the updated app.py and the secrets.py file in Project Knowledge, I can see that Claude DC did create an entirely new implementation without utilizing the existing secrets.py module. Here's what I found:\n\n1. The existing secrets.py module already has comprehensive environment detection and secrets management, but Claude DC's implementation doesn't reference it\n2. The code in app.py now has proper environment detection for secrets, but there may be other files with hardcoded paths\n\nLooking at the broader codebase, Claude DC appears to have created a completely new implementation with his own approach rather than building on existing modules. To minimize your work while ensuring everything functions properly, here's what I recommend:\n\n## Minimal Required Steps\n\n1. **Keep the updated app.py** - Your changes look good and will ensure it works in both environments\n\n2. **Review the demo server components** for hardcoded paths:\n   - `/src/demo/demo_server.py`\n   - `/src/demo/pattern_routes.py`\n   - `/src/demo/visualization_routes.py`\n   \n   Look for lines containing \"/home/computeruse/\" and update them with the same environment-detection pattern\n\n3. **Check processor components** for hardcoded paths:\n   - `/src/processor/transcript_processor.py`\n   - `/src/processor/transcript_loader.py`\n   - `/src/processor/cloud_storage.py`\n\n4. **Create a simple env.py utility** to centralize environment detection:\n   ```python\n   # src/utils/env.py\n   import os\n   \n   def get_environment():\n       \"\"\"Detect which environment we're running in.\"\"\"\n       if os.path.exists('/home/jesse'):\n           return 'jesse'\n       elif os.path.exists('/home/computeruse'):\n           return 'claude_dc'\n       else:\n           return 'unknown'\n   \n   def get_paths():\n       \"\"\"Get environment-specific paths.\"\"\"\n       env = get_environment()\n       if env == 'jesse':\n           return {\n               'secrets': '/home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json',\n               'data': '/home/jesse/palios-data',\n               'repo': '/home/jesse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation'\n           }\n       elif env == 'claude_dc':\n           return {\n               'secrets': '/home/computeruse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json',\n               'data': '/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/data',\n               'repo': '/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation'\n           }\n       else:\n           base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))\n           return {\n               'secrets': os.path.join(base_dir, 'palios-taey-secrets.json'),\n               'data': os.path.join(base_dir, 'data'),\n               'repo': base_dir\n           }\n   ```\n\n5. **Run a find and replace** with the created utility rather than manually editing every file:\n   ```\n   find /path/to/claude-dc-implementation -type f -name \"*.py\" -exec sed -i 's|/home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation|import os; from src.utils.env import get_paths; paths = get_paths(); paths[\"repo\"]|g' {} \\;\n   ```\n\nThis approach minimizes your manual work while ensuring the code will work correctly in both environments. Rather than reviewing and updating every file individually, the utility module and global find/replace will handle most cases.\n\nThe key insight is that Claude DC created a completely new implementation that doesn't leverage the existing code, so we need to adapt his approach rather than trying to reconcile it with previous code."
