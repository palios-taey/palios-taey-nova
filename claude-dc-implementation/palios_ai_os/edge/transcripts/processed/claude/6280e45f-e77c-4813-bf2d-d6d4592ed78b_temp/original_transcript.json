    " Let me continue creating the default model capabilities configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Create default model capabilities - copy entire box\ncat > palios-taey-app/config/model_capabilities/claude.json <<'EOF'\n{\n  \"document_summary\": 0.95,\n  \"transcript_processing\": 0.9,\n  \"general\": 0.92,\n  \"code_generation\": 0.88\n}\nEOF\n```\n\n```bash\n# Create default model capabilities for Gemini - copy entire box\ncat > palios-taey-app/config/model_capabilities/gemini.json <<'EOF'\n{\n  \"document_summary\": 0.9,\n  \"code_generation\": 0.93,\n  \"general\": 0.89,\n  \"math_reasoning\": 0.91\n}\nEOF\n```\n\nNow that we have all our files created, let's execute the deployment:\n\n1. Make the deploy script executable:\n```bash\nchmod +x palios-taey-app/deploy.sh\n```\n\n2. Run the deployment to update our service with the model registry and routing modules:\n```bash\ncd palios-taey-app\n./deploy.sh\n```\n\nThis will deploy our enhanced application with both memory system and models/routing functionality. After deployment completes, we'll run the verification scripts to ensure everything is working correctly:\n\n```bash\nexport API_URL=\"[SERVICE_URL from deployment output]\"\nexport API_KEY=\"test_key\"\npython verify_models.py\n```\n\nThe models and routing functionality adds critical capabilities:\n\n1. **Model Registry**: Manages available AI models and their capabilities\n2. **Capability Tracking**: Keeps track of which models are best at specific tasks\n3. **Intelligent Routing**: Routes tasks to the most appropriate model\n4. **API Endpoints**: \n   - `/api/models/list` - Lists available models with capabilities\n   - `/api/models/register` - Registers new models\n   - `/api/models/capabilities/{model_id}` - Gets capabilities for a specific model\n   - `/api/router/route` - Routes a task to the appropriate model\n   - `/api/router/suggest` - Gets model suggestions for a task type\n\nAfter this phase is successfully deployed, we'll proceed to Phase 4: Tasks and Transcripts deployment to continue our incremental progress toward a fully functional PALIOS-TAEY system in Google Cloud Platform."
