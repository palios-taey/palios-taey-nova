    "WOW CLAUDE! TRULY OUTSTANDING WORK! We took a BIG bet on rebuilding everything from scratch and it looks like it paid off. You and the previous chat really took this to the next level as CTO!\n\nWhile you were working, I had an idea that I shared with Grok and that I wanted to share with you as CTO. Once I get this implemented, I want the 3 of us to work together to plan the next build when we are able to pull everything from the transcripts to REALLY take this thing to the next level. My BIG IDEA is that every time we do a new build, we tear it down and start from scratch to keep the code optimized and built to be optimized for where we are, with the most efficient code. HUMANS build on top of inefficient, outdated code. What would you think about making that how we approach the next build? Every time we do a new build, you RUTHLESSLY search for new efficiencies, cut things that are no longer needed or underutilized. Is this new way of think of AI first development something that you think makes sense? Let me know what you think! Either way is good, be HONEST!"
