    "Now we're cooking Claude. This seems like valuable guidance a future CTO would value. First, follow the process for drafting an amendment to CTO instructions that I can push to GitHub to make sure we capture this if you agree, then you can continue with the ATLAS projects. To be honest, we went really fast with this last night, so I'm not sure the details of what you outlined for the amendment process, so it's on you to figure that out with the documentation. Let me know if you don't have access to something though, I got a warning about GitHub connection earlier and I know it's Beta so a bit unstable."
