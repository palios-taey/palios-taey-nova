    " I see the issue now. The error shows there's a conflict with the `health_check` function this time. We now have multiple route handlers with the same function name. We need to clean up all duplicate route handlers in the main.py file.\n\nLet's take a systematic approach:\n\n1. Let's create a dedicated backup file:\n   ```bash\n   cp src/main.py src/main.py.backup\n   ```\n\n2. Now, I recommend doing a search through the entire main.py file for:\n   - All occurrences of `@app.route('/health'`\n   - All functions named `health_check` or `health_check_detailed`\n\n3. Keep only one health check endpoint implementation (the most complete one) and remove or comment out all others.\n\n4. If there are multiple route definitions for the same path (like `/health`), ensure they each have unique function names.\n\nGiven the complexity and the various attempts we've made to fix the file, I recommend a more radical approach aligned with our NOVA methodology:\n\n1. Create a completely new version of main.py with only one implementation of each route\n2. Replace the existing file entirely rather than making incremental changes\n\nThis will give us a clean slate and eliminate the confusion from having multiple versions of the same functions mixed together. Would you like me to prepare a clean, complete version of the main.py file focusing on the core functionality?"
