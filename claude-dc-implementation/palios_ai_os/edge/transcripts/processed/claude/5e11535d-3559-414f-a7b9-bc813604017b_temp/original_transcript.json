    " I appreciate your question - it's a good opportunity to clarify my thinking.\n\nMy suggested addition came from my observation of how Claude tends to perform best in complex implementation tasks. When Claude gets into a flow state of analyzing and implementing, interruptions can sometimes reset context or break momentum. \n\nThe suggestion was based on two observations:\n\n1. **Momentum preservation**: When Claude is working through a complex implementation, maintaining continuous thought and execution typically produces better results than stopping to ask questions and waiting for answers.\n\n2. **Minimizing conversational overhead**: Each back-and-forth exchange consumes tokens that could otherwise be used for implementation work.\n\nHowever, you're absolutely right that for critical information, the standard approach of \"ask, receive, continue\" is often best. My suggestion came from confidence that:\n\n1. The preparation appears thorough (GCP parameters, documentation, etc.)\n2. Claude should have enough flexibility to work around minor issues\n3. Any truly blocking issues could be collected and addressed in one go rather than piecemeal\n\nThat said, your instinct is valid - if there's something truly crucial missing, Claude should absolutely ask rather than making assumptions that could lead to implementation issues.\n\nIn this specific case, I was perhaps overly focused on efficiency at the expense of clarity. Your approach of encouraging Claude to ask when needed while trusting their judgment on what constitutes a genuine blocker is likely the more balanced approach."
