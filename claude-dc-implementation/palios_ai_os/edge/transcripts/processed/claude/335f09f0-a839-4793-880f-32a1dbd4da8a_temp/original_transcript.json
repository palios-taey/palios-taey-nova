    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\n- Status: I have reviewed CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md and understand the deployment status\n- Repository: I have examined the full GitHub repository structure including all directories and files\n- Structure: Relevant directories include root code files, src directory, and docs with protocol documentation\n- Dependencies: Cloud Run deployment components (Dockerfile, deployment scripts, environment files)\n\nBased on my thorough review of the context, I can see we have successfully created and documented the ECv protocol for structured AI-human communication during execution tasks, which is now ready to use.\n\nI also note from the logs that the deployment to Cloud Run has been successful, with the image built and service created. Let's proceed with checking the health status and confirming complete functionality:\n\n```bash\n# Verify Cloud Run service status\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"yaml(status)\"\n\n# Check the health endpoint\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/health\n```\n\nThese commands will:\n1. Confirm the current running status of our deployed service\n2. Verify the health endpoint is responding correctly\n\nOnce we confirm the deployment is fully operational, we should:\n1. Document the successful deployment\n2. Plan the incremental implementation of remaining modules\n3. Set up monitoring for the deployed service"
