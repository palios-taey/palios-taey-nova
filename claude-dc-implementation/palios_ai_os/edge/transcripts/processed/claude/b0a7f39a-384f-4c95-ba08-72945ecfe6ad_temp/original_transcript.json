    " For terminal output like this, pasting the text directly as you did is the most efficient. It allows me to:\n1. Easily read and parse the exact output\n2. Copy/reference specific parts in my responses\n3. Process error messages or logs accurately\n4. Search through larger outputs efficiently\n\nScreenshots can be useful for:\n1. UI issues where visual layout matters\n2. Complex visual outputs like charts or diagrams\n3. Error messages with important colors/formatting\n\nFor our current work with command line tools and code, text is ideal. You're already doing it the best way - copying and pasting the terminal output directly.\n\nNow that we've confirmed the base system is working again, would you like me to proceed with adding AI model capabilities registration? I think that's the most foundational enhancement we could add first."
