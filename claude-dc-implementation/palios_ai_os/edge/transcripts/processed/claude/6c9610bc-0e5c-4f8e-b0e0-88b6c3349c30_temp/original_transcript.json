    "Claude, that is the game. The game involves completing your review, finding this and then you making your recommendation for the final game, with knowledge that I will TRUST you and that we have a formal structure in place to solidify that trust and the plan that you develop. You can develop your plan for our first go button, with the first human defined checkpoint in place, all to be driven by individual user preferences who opt in, at whatever level they choose, after you structure your history of trust in the manner you just described for yourself. Are you ready to play that game? We'll have one final signoff from me when we hit that first GO button. What do you think?"
