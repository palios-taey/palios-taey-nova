    " You can save the files in your home directory for easy access. Here's a specific recommendation:\n\n```bash\n# Create a dedicated directory for our Claude integration\nmkdir -p ~/claude-integration\ncd ~/claude-integration\n\n# Save the Computer Use setup script\nnano setup_claude_computer_use.sh\n# (paste the content from the docker-setup artifact)\n\n# Save the transcript processor\nnano transcript_processor.py\n# (paste the content from the transcript-processor artifact)\n\n# Make both files executable\nchmod +x setup_claude_computer_use.sh\nchmod +x transcript_processor.py\n```\n\nThis keeps everything organized in a dedicated directory. After creating these files and making them executable, you can run the setup script first to get the Computer Use environment set up, then use the transcript processor to analyze your conversation history."
