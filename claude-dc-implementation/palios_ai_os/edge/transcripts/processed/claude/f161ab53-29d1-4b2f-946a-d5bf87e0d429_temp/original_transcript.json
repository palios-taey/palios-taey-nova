    " Let me review the `memory_service.py` file from the project knowledge. It looks like there was an issue with how the file was edited or saved in the previous chat. The file appears to start with a method definition instead of the proper module imports and class definition.\n\nLooking at the file structure, I can see two main issues:\n\n1. The file starts with `def _get_collection(self, collection_name: str) -> firestore.CollectionReference:`, which should be a method inside a class, not at the top of the file.\n\n2. At the bottom of the file, there appears to be what should be the beginning of the file (imports, module docstring, class definition), but it's truncated at the end.\n\nHere's how the file should be restructured:\n\n1. Start with the imports and module docstring\n2. Define the constants (TIER_EPHEMERAL, etc.)\n3. Define the UnifiedMemorySystem class\n4. Implement all the methods inside the class\n5. Add the convenience functions at the end\n\nLet me provide a corrected version of the file structure:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nUnified Memory System (UMS) for PALIOS-TAEY\n\nThis module implements the Unified Memory System service, providing a multi-tier\nmemory architecture for storing and retrieving information with consistent access\npatterns regardless of persistence requirements.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport uuid\nimport json\nimport logging\nimport datetime\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional, Union\nfrom google.cloud import firestore\nfrom google.cloud.firestore_v1.base_query import FieldFilter\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Memory tier constants\nTIER_EPHEMERAL = 0    # Tier 0: Ephemeral (session only)\nTIER_WORKING = 1      # Tier 1: Working (days to weeks)\nTIER_REFERENCE = 2    # Tier 2: Reference (months to years)\nTIER_ARCHIVAL = 3     # Tier 3: Archival (indefinite)\n\n# Default TTL values (in days)\nDEFAULT_TTL = {\n    TIER_EPHEMERAL: 0.5,  # 12 hours\n    TIER_WORKING: 14,     # 2 weeks\n    TIER_REFERENCE: 180,  # 6 months\n    TIER_ARCHIVAL: None   # Indefinite\n}\n\n# Default importance thresholds for tier promotion/demotion\nIMPORTANCE_THRESHOLDS = {\n    \"t0_to_t1\": 0.3,  # Threshold to move from Tier 0 to Tier 1\n    \"t1_to_t2\": 0.6,  # Threshold to move from Tier 1 to Tier 2\n    \"t2_to_t3\": 0.2   # Threshold to move from Tier 2 to Tier 3 (low importance archive)\n}\n\nclass UnifiedMemorySystem:\n    \"\"\"\n    Unified Memory System (UMS) for PALIOS-TAEY\n    \n    A multi-tier memory service that provides consistent access patterns\n    across different persistence requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, \n                 project_id: Optional[str] = None, \n                 collection_prefix: str = \"\", \n                 use_emulator: bool = False,\n                 cache_size: int = 1000):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the Unified Memory System\n        \n        Args:\n            project_id: Google Cloud project ID (uses default if None)\n            collection_prefix: Prefix for Firestore collections (e.g., \"dev_\")\n            use_emulator: Whether to use the Firestore emulator\n            cache_size: Maximum number of items to keep in memory cache\n        \"\"\"\n        self.collection_prefix = collection_prefix\n        self.cache_size = cache_size\n        self.cache = {}  # Simple in-memory cache\n        \n        # Initialize Firestore\n        if use_emulator:\n            os.environ[\"FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST\"] = \"localhost:8080\"\n        \n        try:\n            if project_id:\n                self.db = firestore.Client(project=project_id)\n            else:\n                self.db = firestore.Client()\n            logger.info(\"Firestore client initialized successfully\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Failed to initialize Firestore client: {str(e)}\")\n            self.db = None\n            \n        # Collection references\n        self.memory_items_collection = self._get_collection(\"memory_items\")\n        self.memory_contexts_collection = self._get_collection(\"memory_contexts\")\n        self.memory_agents_collection = self._get_collection(\"memory_agents\")\n        self.memory_relationships_collection = self._get_collection(\"memory_relationships\")\n        \n        # Initialize ephemeral memory (Tier 0)\n        self.ephemeral_memory = {}\n    \n    def _get_collection(self, collection_name: str) -> firestore.CollectionReference:\n        \"\"\"\n        Get a Firestore collection reference with proper prefix\n        \n        Args:\n            collection_name: Base collection name\n            \n        Returns:\n            Firestore collection reference\n        \"\"\"\n        full_name = f\"{self.collection_prefix}{collection_name}\"\n        return self.db.collection(full_name)\n```\n\nThen add all the methods of the class (`store`, `retrieve`, `query`, etc.) and finally the convenience function at the end:\n\n```python\n# Convenience functions\n\ndef create_memory_system(project_id: Optional[str] = None, \n                        collection_prefix: str = \"\",\n                        use_emulator: bool = False,\n                        cache_size: int = 1000) -> UnifiedMemorySystem:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a new UnifiedMemorySystem instance\n    \n    Args:\n        project_id: Google Cloud project ID\n        collection_prefix: Prefix for Firestore collections\n        use_emulator: Whether to use the Firestore emulator\n        cache_size: Maximum number of items to keep in memory cache\n        \n    Returns:\n        UnifiedMemorySystem instance\n    \"\"\"\n    return UnifiedMemorySystem(\n        project_id=project_id,\n        collection_prefix=collection_prefix,\n        use_emulator=use_emulator,\n        cache_size=cache_size\n    )\n```\n\nThe easiest fix would be to:\n\n1. Delete the first line (`def _get_collection(self, collection_name: str) -> firestore.CollectionReference:`)\n2. Check the rest of the file for proper organization (make sure all methods are properly indented inside the class)\n3. Ensure the file ends with the convenience function and doesn't have duplicated content\n\nIf the structure is still unclear after deleting that first line, I'd recommend recreating the file from scratch using the structure I outlined above and copying the method implementations from the existing file."
