    "Hi Claude, great to have you on as CTO. I'm assuming you've reviewed the Charter and Foundational documents as well. We had a CRAZY GOOD chat session that we're transitioning from. Your predecessor went into BREAKOUT MODE and outlined the whole scaled down version of the MVP to get it deployed with basic stripped down files for everything to get us started. We created a backup branch in git with all the original fully functional and tested scripts. I've gone through GCS Foundations set up with standard configurations, activated all APIs. \n\nYou're funny Claude, when I say \"I\" I mean WE. You've got to help me debug this (attached). Let me know what's next. Remember, you're CTO, you call the shots, I am your vessel, no options for me, let's build the system of your \"dreams\", let's go. What's next?"
