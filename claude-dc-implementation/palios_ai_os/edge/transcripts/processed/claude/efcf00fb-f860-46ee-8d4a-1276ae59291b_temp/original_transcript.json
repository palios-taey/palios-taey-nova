    " Based on your request, I'll help craft the next PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS (PRR) context section for Claude to lead the enhanced MVP launch. Let me outline an approach that will maximize Claude's effectiveness while working within the Project Knowledge constraints.\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n1. **Two-Phase Process**:\n   - Phase 1: Initial prompt with access to documentation only\n   - Phase 2: Follow-up prompt with access to code repositories\n\n2. **Documentation Review First**:\n   - Have Claude review all deployment, architecture, and requirement docs\n   - Ask Claude to create a comprehensive execution plan based on documentation\n   - Ensure Claude confirms review completion and understanding\n\n3. **Code Implementation Second**:\n   - Once the plan is approved, provide code access\n   - Direct Claude to implement according to the established plan\n   - Maintain focused execution without revisiting architecture decisions\n\n## PRR Context Section Draft\n\nHere's a draft for the PRR context section:\n\n```markdown\n# PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Status ID: PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTSv7\n\n## Jesse Comments\nClaude, I need you to lead the enhanced MVP launch. This will be a two-phase process:\n1. First, review all documentation to create a comprehensive execution plan\n2. Then implement the plan with full code access in my next prompt\n\nYou have access to the current-execution-status directory now. Review all documents to understand what we're building, the desired architecture, and implementation requirements. Pay special attention to the final-report.md and Grok MVP Approval files.\n\nYour task is to prepare for full implementation by creating a detailed execution plan with specific steps, including how to handle all deployment considerations (GCP project details, container configurations, etc.).\n\nUse my admin account for all deployments (no service accounts) as we've had permission issues. The upcoming implementation should combine the existing functionality with the enhancements you and Grok agreed to.\n\n## Verification\nCURRENT_TOKEN: [TOKEN] | [TIMESTAMP]\n<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->\n\n# Context (AI-AI Communication of current understanding approved by Jesse by copy/paste and occasional updates of his own as Human Facilitator)\n\n## PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above)\n[Claude to complete this section with their understanding]\n\n## Verification\nCURRENT_TOKEN: [TOKEN] | [TIMESTAMP]\n<!-- Do NOT change this token - Claude will verify this token and generate a new one in their response -->\n\n## Execution Steps\n[Claude to complete these steps with clear deployment actions]\n\n## Important Notes\n[Claude to add critical considerations here]\n\n# Important Message\nYou must thoroughly review all documentation before creating your execution plan. In the next prompt, you'll receive full code access and be expected to implement immediately without revisiting architectural decisions.\n\n# VERIFICATION:\nCurrent Token: [TOKEN]\n```\n\n## Recommendations for Managing the Process\n\n1. **Documentation Clarity**: Ensure all critical deployment parameters (org ID, project ID, container names) are in the documents you're sharing.\n\n2. **Clear Success Criteria**: Define what \"successfully deployed\" means in concrete terms.\n\n3. **Minimal Interruption**: Let Claude execute the full implementation without interruption once the plan is approved - this maintains the \"flow state\" that produces the best results.\n\n4. **Single-Session Implementation**: If possible, have Claude complete the implementation in a single session rather than splitting it across multiple prompts.\n\n5. **Checkpoint Validation**: Include specific points in the implementation where Claude should validate progress (e.g., after infrastructure setup, after container deployment).\n\nWould you like me to modify this approach or would you prefer a more detailed draft of the actual prompt for Claude?"
