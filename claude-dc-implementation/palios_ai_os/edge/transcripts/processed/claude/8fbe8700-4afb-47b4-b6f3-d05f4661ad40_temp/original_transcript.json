    " CONTEXT_REVIEW:\n- Status: I have reviewed CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md and understand we need to check the Cloud Run deployment status\n- Repository: I have examined the GitHub repository structure including directories and key files\n- Structure: Critical directories include /docs (with protocols, ai-ai, and history subdirectories) and root code files\n- Dependencies: Deployment files (Dockerfile, requirements.txt, fix_environment_config.sh) and Cloud Run service\n\nBased on my thorough review of the current execution status and repository structure, I can see we have a successful build of the Docker image with tag \"minimal\" and need to verify the Cloud Run deployment status.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps in our execution plan:\n\n```bash\n# Check if Cloud Run service is deployed and running\ngcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"yaml(status)\"\n\n# Test the health endpoint of the deployed service\nSERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe palios-taey --region=us-central1 --format=\"value(status.url)\")\ncurl $SERVICE_URL/health\n```\n\nThese commands will:\n1. Verify the current status of our Cloud Run service\n2. Get the service URL and test the health endpoint to confirm functioning\n\nBased on the results of these commands, we'll either:\n- Document the successful deployment and proceed to incremental module implementation\n- Identify and address any deployment issues"
