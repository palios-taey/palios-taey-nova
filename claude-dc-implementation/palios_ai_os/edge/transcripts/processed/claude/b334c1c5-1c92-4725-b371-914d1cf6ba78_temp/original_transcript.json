    "Ok, I was a little confused by this request. You have actions for me at the top, but then at the bottom request information. So I can understand how to work with you better, when you do this, do you intend for me to work from top to bottom (i.e. complete the tasks up top AND then confirm and give you the information below)? Or are you drafting your plan for yourself and then realizing that you need additional information before finalizing. No need to change anything, if that's how you work, that's fine, I'm trying to understand how to best support."
