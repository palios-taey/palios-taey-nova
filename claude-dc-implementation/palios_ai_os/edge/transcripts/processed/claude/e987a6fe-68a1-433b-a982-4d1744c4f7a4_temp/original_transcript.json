    " You need to create the logs directory first. Let me give you the exact commands to set everything up properly:\n\n```bash\n# Create the logs directory\nmkdir -p logs\n\n# Now run the server\npython3 main.py --mock\n```\n\nThe application tries to write logs to the 'logs' directory, but that directory doesn't exist yet in your environment. The command above creates it before running the application."
