    " Let's update your network.tf by adding the missing VPC connector resource while keeping your existing resources. Here's the code to add to your network.tf file:\n\n```terraform\n# Create a serverless VPC access connector for Cloud Run\nresource \"google_vpc_access_connector\" \"connector\" {\n  name           = \"palios-taey-vpc-connector\"\n  region         = var.region\n  ip_cidr_range  = \"10.8.0.0/28\"\n  network        = google_compute_network.vpc_network.id\n  project        = var.project_id\n}\n```\n\nAdd this code to your network.tf file, keeping all your existing code. This will create the missing VPC connector that's referenced in your Cloud Run configuration.\n\nRegarding the Firestore issue, let's check the code in your firestore.tf file:\n\n```bash\nnano firestore.tf\n```\n\nLook for any unsupported parameters like `point_in_time_recovery_enabled` and remove them if found.\n\nThen run the plan again:\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```"
