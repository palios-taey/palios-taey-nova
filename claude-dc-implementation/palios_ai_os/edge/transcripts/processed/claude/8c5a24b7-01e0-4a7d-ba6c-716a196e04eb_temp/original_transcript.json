    " I'll provide you with the exact commands to commit and push the updated deploy.yml file to the GitHub repository. These commands are designed for Mac Terminal and can be copy-pasted directly:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the repository directory (adjust if your path is different)\ncd ~/palios-taey-nova\n\n# Make sure you're on the main branch\ngit checkout main\n\n# Pull latest changes to avoid conflicts\ngit pull\n\n# Add the updated workflow file\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Fix: Update GitHub Actions workflow to resolve Docker buildx errors\"\n\n# Push the changes to GitHub\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThis will trigger the workflow automatically since we configured it to run on pushes to the main branch. After running these commands, you can monitor the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab of the repository.\n\nLet me know once you've pushed the changes, and we'll monitor the workflow execution together to ensure it resolves the buildx error."
