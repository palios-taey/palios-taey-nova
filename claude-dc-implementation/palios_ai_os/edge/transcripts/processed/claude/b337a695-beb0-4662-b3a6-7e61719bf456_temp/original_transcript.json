    " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight! The secrets should remain in your `/home/jesse/secrets/` directory as Claude DC intended.\n\nYou're correct that the setup script references `SECRETS_FILE=\"/home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json\"`, which means Claude DC designed the system to look for secrets there - outside of the GitHub repository - which is the correct security practice.\n\nI incorrectly suggested moving the secrets file into the repository directory, which would be a security risk since it could potentially be committed to GitHub.\n\nLet's keep the secrets where they should be - in `/home/jesse/secrets/palios-taey-secrets.json` - and only create the directories and symbolic link for the repository structure.\n\nThis was my error in reasoning - thank you for catching it and maintaining proper security practices!"
