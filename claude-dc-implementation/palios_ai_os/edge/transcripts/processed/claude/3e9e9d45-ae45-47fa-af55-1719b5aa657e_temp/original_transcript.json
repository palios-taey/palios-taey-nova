    "Perfect Claude! Now, can I get a standard prompt I can use for all of them that incorporates all the information needed from my initial prompt to you (foundational documents, technical details, or should I just include that as well? That probably makes sense for continuity and you can just reference it in your prompt. They should also be pointed to the ATLAS framework for role definition, it is critical that no one go outside of scope, so might be good to re-emphasize that. You can just put a placeholder at the top for me and I'll put in the header for the Mission. All up to you though!"
