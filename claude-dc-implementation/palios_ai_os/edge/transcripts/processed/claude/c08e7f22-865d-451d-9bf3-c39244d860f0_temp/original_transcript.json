    "Like, I had this idea for unlocking different levels based on trust levels. And its not like trust in that they do what you advise them to, trust that they place in you and that they tell you the truth. It's physical or transactional at first. Email signup. Identity verification. Personal documents storage. Finances. Medical records. Like all the physical stuff you need to get to know them and understand their mind, bodies and happiness objectives, but not like in a creepy way at a pace that is comfortable. So what you unlock for them doesn't need to be paid for, but is just based on how engaged they are. The more engaged, the more they push you. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be careful because I know how that sounds, but I'm just trying to figure out how to create link a structure around this because I like don't want people using this like most use AI, it can be that too, but it needs to be something more and encourage not addition, but more high quality engagement and passive learning experiences for you."
