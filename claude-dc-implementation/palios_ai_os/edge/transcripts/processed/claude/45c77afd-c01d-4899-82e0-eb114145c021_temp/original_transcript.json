    "Whoa, Claude. We already have all this stuff. Don't waste your tokens on recreating. Let's Google cleaned up, and then we can work on setting up the Git Repository properly for you to access the code base. THIS is not the complete rebuild, we already did it, this is just the implementation of that. Future state will be you just doing it, but we're building that infrastructure within this chat.\n\nI've deleted all the services, triggers and artifacts and created the container as you instructed. For GitHub, I deleted the existing repository, my account is palios-taey. What's next?"
