    " Let's try with the `-backend=false` flag to explicitly tell Terraform not to use a backend:\n\n```bash\nterraform init -backend=false\n```\n\nThis will force Terraform to use local state storage instead of trying to configure a remote backend.\n\nIf that still doesn't work, we'll need to edit the main.tf file more thoroughly to remove any reference to a backend, even if it's commented out. Sometimes Terraform still tries to interpret backend configurations even when they appear to be commented."
