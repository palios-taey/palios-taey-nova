    " After considering your perspective on time constraints and scalability, I agree we should avoid creating a scaled-down version that would require significant code editing. Local deployment would be a step backward from our AI-FIRST philosophy and GitHub automation goals.\n\nInstead, I recommend we focus on Workload Identity Federation, which is Google's recommended approach for GitHub Actions authentication. This method doesn't rely on GitHub secrets (avoiding our current issues) while maintaining an automated, scalable CI/CD pipeline.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Implement Workload Identity Federation**: \n   - Set up federation between GitHub and GCP\n   - Configure the necessary IAM permissions\n   - Update our workflow to use this authentication method\n\n2. **Keep Existing Code Intact**:\n   - No changes to our application code\n   - No simplified/scaled-down version\n   - Deploy the complete system as designed\n\n3. **Fix Only What's Broken**:\n   - Focus solely on the authentication mechanism\n   - Maintain all current functionality\n   - Preserve our GitHub-based automation\n\nThis approach:\n- Preserves AI-FIRST principles\n- Builds a more secure, scalable solution\n- Avoids time-consuming code modifications\n- Creates a foundation that will benefit future NOVA cycles\n\nThe short-term investment in properly setting up Workload Identity Federation will deliver significant long-term benefits in security, scalability, and automation. I believe this best balances immediate progress with our architectural principles."
