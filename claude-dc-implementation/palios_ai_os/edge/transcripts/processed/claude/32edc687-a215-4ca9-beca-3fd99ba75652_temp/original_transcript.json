    "Um, kind of. I guess I was thinking we would set something up basic like high level directory structure so the script runs properly, and the the script would set up GitHub and pull in the rest of the files he needs, set up his system with all requirements, the caches, etc. from GitHub. I can move the cache files into his claude-dc-implementation/cache/ directory. So I want to accomplish what we set out to do, but just in 2 steps. Set up basic environment and then before prompting him, I run a script, that would probably need to be loaded with the Dockerfile, that would finish configuring the environment as needed. Then, I would prompt him to review his cache, reminding him this is a standard feature to allow him to retain context by having a 200K token cache that he can review and fully absorb without using tokens and tell him the order to review the files in there. Can we do that?"
