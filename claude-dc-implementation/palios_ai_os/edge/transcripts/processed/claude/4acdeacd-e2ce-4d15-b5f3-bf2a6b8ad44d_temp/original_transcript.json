    " I see the issue in the error logs. We have a syntax error in the `model_registry.py` file at line 102. The error is with the triple quotes for the docstring - there appears to be an extra quote at the end.\n\nLet me fix this issue and provide a complete solution: \n\nNow let's implement a streamlined approach to update, test, and deploy our system: \n\n\n\nI've prepared a corrected version of the `model_registry.py` file and deployment instructions. Here's what happened and how to fix it:\n\n## Issue Identified\n\nThe error in the logs shows a syntax error in `model_registry.py` at line 102, specifically with the docstring declaration. The extra quote at the end of the docstring was causing the Python interpreter to fail when parsing the file.\n\n## Solution\n\nI've prepared a complete, corrected version of `model_registry.py` that:\n1. Fixes the syntax error in the docstring\n2. Implements proper fallback initialization with default models\n3. Ensures all methods work correctly\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Save the corrected `model_registry.py` file to your `src` directory:\n   - Copy the content from the `model-registry-fix-corrected` artifact\n   - Save it to `src/model_registry.py`, replacing the existing file\n\n2. Commit and push the changes:\n   ```bash\n   git add src/model_registry.py\n   git commit -m \"Fix syntax error in model_registry.py and implement fallback initialization\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n3. Wait for the deployment to complete (typically 2-5 minutes)\n\n4. Verify the deployment:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://palios-taey-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app/health\n   ```\n\nThis approach aligns with our NOVA methodology by focusing on a clean, targeted fix to the specific issue while ensuring the system becomes operational quickly.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail?"
