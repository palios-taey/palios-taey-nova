    " You're absolutely right. Let me create a more comprehensive implementation tracker that better preserves the critical information from previous sessions while updating only what's changed in our current session. \n\nI've completely restructured the implementation tracker to better serve as a knowledge preservation document between sessions. The key improvements include:\n\n1. A clear \"CURRENT SESSION UPDATES\" section at the top that can be modified in each session\n2. A \"PERSISTENT INFORMATION\" section with explicit instructions not to modify between sessions\n3. Proper preservation of all critical environment information, GitHub details, and cloud configuration\n4. Clearer organization of implementation insights and lessons learned\n5. Explicit instructions for future Claude CTOs on how to use and update the document\n\nThis approach will make handoffs between Claude sessions much more efficient and ensure that critical information is preserved intact. In future sessions, I'll know to immediately request this tracker and only update the top current session section.\n\nRegarding our GitHub Actions authentication issue, I agree that we should continue working on fixing the Workload Identity Federation rather than falling back to manual deployment. The audience mismatch error gives us a specific issue to focus on in our next session.\n\nWould you like me to create a more detailed plan for fixing the Workload Identity Federation configuration, or should we continue this in our next session?"
