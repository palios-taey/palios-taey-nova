    "Perfect Claude! This keeps getting better and better. We have learned so much about each other and how to optimize this process. I can't wait to reflect on this with you afterwards to improve the NOVA documentation with our findings and share with Grok.\n\nYour plan sounds great. Attached is where the previous Claude left off on the transcript_processor.py file. I've also included a screenshot of the directory so you understand how that is structured. Now, remember to keep track of implementation by regenerating the NOVA Implementation Tracker for yourself first. Once that is complete, send me a prompt confirming, and then I'll respond with the build go ahead so you can use full bandwidth on the code. Also remember that once this file is complete, you need to update the implementation tracker and respond to me before moving to the next file."
