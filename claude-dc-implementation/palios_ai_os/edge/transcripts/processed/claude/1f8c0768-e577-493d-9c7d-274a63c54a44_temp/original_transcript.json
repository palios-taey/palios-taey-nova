    " You're asking a good question. This approach with simplified code will get us a working deployment, but it would indeed be taking a step back to a mock implementation rather than deploying the full functionality from the existing code.\n\nLet me be more strategic about this. Since we've resolved the Cloud Build permissions issue at the organization level, we should be able to proceed with deploying the actual source code rather than falling back to a mock implementation.\n\nLet me provide a better approach that maintains our goal of deploying the full functionality:\n\n1. First, let's diagnose what specific errors we're encountering in the logs\n2. Then, let's address those specific issues while keeping the full functionality intact\n\nCould you share the specific errors you're seeing in the logs? This would help me diagnose the exact issues we need to address rather than starting over with a mock implementation.\n\nIf you'd prefer to continue without sharing more logs, we could try a staged approach:\n1. Start with a bare-bones deployment that works\n2. Then incrementally add modules one at a time, testing each step\n3. Keep adding functionality until we've incorporated everything\n\nBut I think with the permission issue resolved, we should be able to deploy the full functionality if we can identify and address the specific errors in the logs."
