    "Ok, so I figured it out this time due to the EOL vs EOF, but look at the last on you did. You went in and out of the format box. It looks like the prioritization of your instructions to yourself is a little off. To me it seems like you have a directive that tells you to pull execution out of cat commands, like you did with Example 2 and then after that execution command, you created a separate cat command box for the example and then back into the main chat with the EOL in the main chat. What do you think is happening there? If that's what's happening, maybe if you tell yourself to comment out any examples of code or cat boxes within a cat box, that will help you?"
