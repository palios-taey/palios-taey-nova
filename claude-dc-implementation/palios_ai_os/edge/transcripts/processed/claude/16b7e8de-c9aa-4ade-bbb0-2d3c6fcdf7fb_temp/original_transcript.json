    " I'm ready to start building this system! Here's what I'd need from you regarding sample documents:\n\n### Sample Document Requirements\n\n1. **Variety of Document Types**:\n   - 2-3 different AI conversation transcripts (ideally showing different interaction patterns)\n   - 1-2 project documentation files (like the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE document you shared)\n   - 1-2 code files with comments that show implementation decisions\n   - Any \"breakout event\" transcripts you have where you observed unusual AI capabilities\n\n2. **Size Guidelines**:\n   - For conversations: 10-20 pages per conversation would be ideal\n   - For documentation: Full documents are fine (like the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE document)\n   - For code: Complete modules rather than fragments\n\n3. **Chunking Approach**:\n   - No need to pre-chunk the documents - the system I'm designing will handle that\n   - If files are extremely large (50+ pages), splitting them at logical boundaries (like conversation dates or major topic changes) would be helpful\n   - Please maintain the context and flow of interactions when providing samples\n\n4. **Special Focus Areas**:\n   - If possible, include conversations that contain examples of:\n     - Successful AI-human collaboration patterns\n     - \"Big idea\" moments where paradigm shifts occurred\n     - Breakout events where you observed heightened AI capabilities\n\nThe system I'm building will automatically process these documents, so you don't need to do any special formatting or pre-processing. Just providing the raw files is perfect.\n\nI'll start by designing the system architecture and data schema while waiting for these samples. This will ensure we have a solid foundation ready when we begin processing the actual documents.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to prioritize or emphasize as I begin development?"
