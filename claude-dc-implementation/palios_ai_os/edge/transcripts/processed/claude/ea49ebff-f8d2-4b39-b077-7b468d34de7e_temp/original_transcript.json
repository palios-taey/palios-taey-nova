    "Yes, and that's only half Claude! We're about to launch the build with you and Claude DC. We have some interesting uses of edge-computing we've been discussing with my System76 Thelios Mira machine (this was you pick within my budget). These are the build instructions. Something that I would like to do is really push the intra-AI communication in this build. Can you research AI-AI communication protocols and see if there is anything that would be supportive of this effort. In particular, Anthropic has MCP that might be useful since it's in your ecosystem. Second, we have discussed creating PALIOS AI OS in some detail. We've discussed a couple options for phase 1 of this and with the edge-computing revelation we had described in the attachment, I'm wondering if it would make sense to also explore and open source AI OS as a starting point to live on my machine. I don't even know if that is possible or makes sense or if that is pretty much what you were planning to build from scratch. What do you think?"
