    " Yes, you can absolutely change the file name manually. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. First, check what the main.py file is importing:\n```bash\n# Check what main.py is importing - copy entire box\ncat palios-taey-app/main.py\n```\n\n2. Then rename or copy the file based on what you find:\n```bash\n# If you want to rename the file - copy entire box\nmv palios-taey-app/src/palios_taey/memory/service.py palios-taey-app/memory_system.py\n```\n\nOr if you prefer to keep the original and make a copy:\n```bash\n# If you want to make a copy - copy entire box\ncp palios-taey-app/src/palios_taey/memory/service.py palios-taey-app/memory_system.py\n```\n\nThis direct approach is often the simplest solution. After making this change, you can run the deployment script again."
