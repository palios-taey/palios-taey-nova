    "Great Claude! All outstanding work! Now that this is complete, can you generate the next PRR # Context section for you to get the enhanced MVP launched? I've re-added the GitHub to the current-execution-status directory if you need a refresh. \n\nFor this, I want him to just review everything that is in there, come up with a plan, and then with my next prompt, have him GO on it. What I'd like to understand from you is how best to do this. What I'm thinking is that I'll need to provide access to just the docs with the initial prompt due to restrictions on how many files can be included in Project Knowledge. Then, he should know that he just really needs to confirm he reviewed them all and that it is critical to do so because after he responds, he'll get access to all the code and be expected to implement the existing functionality with the additions that you and Grok agreed to for this deployment and get the solution fully deployed. It is important that he not use service accounts and only my admin account at this time as we had many issues with permissions that blocked us. I want to make sure he has everything he needs deployment wise to just go with it as well, org id, project id, container names, etc. that are in GCS. Also, what are you recommendations on how to manage this process? I feel like you do your best work when you come up with the plan and then just go straight through. It's like you're in the zone and everything just comes together. What do you think? Feel free to ask clarifying questions or draft the prompt if you're confident on how to approach."
