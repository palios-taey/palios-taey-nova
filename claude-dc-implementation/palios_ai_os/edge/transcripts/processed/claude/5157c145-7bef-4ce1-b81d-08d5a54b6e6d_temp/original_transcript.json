    " Thank you for the additional context. That changes the situation a bit, but the core strategy remains similar.\n\nIf I understand correctly:\n- The new repository (`palios-taey-nova`) has some sample script files created by the first ATLAS Claude\n- These need to be replaced with the full implementation files from the archive folder\n- There aren't duplicate files between directories, just incomplete implementations in the new one\n\nGiven this updated context, I'd adjust our approach:\n\n## Revised Migration Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Implementation Files**:\n   - Review the archive folder to locate all complete implementation files\n   - Map these files to the appropriate locations in the new repository structure\n   - Identify which sample files need to be replaced vs. which components need new implementations\n\n2. **Prioritize Component Migration**:\n   - Start with replacing the sample files with complete implementations\n   - Then move to components that don't have any implementation yet\n   - Maintain the same sequence priority (Memory Service first, then Model Registry, etc.)\n\n3. **Create Component-Specific ATLAS Missions**:\n   - Create a mission for each major component migration/implementation\n   - Maintain clear boundaries to prevent scope creep\n   - Include verification criteria for each mission\n\n## Immediate Next Steps\n\n1. **Create an inventory of sample files vs. complete implementations**:\n   - Identify which files in the new structure need replacement\n   - Document which components have no implementation at all\n\n2. **Launch first migration ATLAS mission**:\n   - Start with the Memory Service migration, replacing sample files with complete implementation\n   - Define clear success criteria for the migration\n   - Include comprehensive testing requirements\n\n3. **Set up regular integration testing**:\n   - Test each component after migration to ensure functionality is preserved\n   - Address any integration issues early before proceeding to subsequent components\n\nWould you like me to prepare an ATLAS delegation brief for the first component migration? This would focus on replacing the sample Memory Service implementation with the complete one from the archive, including clear technical specifications and success criteria."
