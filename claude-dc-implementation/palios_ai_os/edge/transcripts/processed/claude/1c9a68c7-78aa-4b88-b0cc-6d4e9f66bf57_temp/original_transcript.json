    " The setup.sh file shouldn't need any updates if you're mounting the SSH key to the path `/home/computeruse/secrets/github_ssh_key` as shown in the run script. The setup.sh is already configured to look for the key at that location.\n\nHowever, if you want to be extra certain, you can check these points in setup.sh:\n\n1. It should be checking for the key file at `/home/computeruse/secrets/github_ssh_key`\n2. It should be copying that key to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (or more accurately, to match your ED25519 key type, you could update it to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)\n3. It should be setting permissions with `chmod 600`\n\nIf your setup.sh already handles these steps, then no changes are needed. The script should work with your existing ED25519 SSH key without modifications.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues when running the setup, and I can help troubleshoot!"
