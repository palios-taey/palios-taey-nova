    "Awesome! Here is the feedback from ATLAS Claude\nI'll help you with setting up a clean GitHub repository structure and organizing the codebase for the PALIOS-TAEY system implementation using the NOVA methodology. Let me acknowledge my role and outline my approach.\nATLAS REPORT: Initial Assessment & Information Request\nANALYSIS\nBased on the delegation brief, I understand I'm tasked with establishing a clean GitHub repository and organizing the codebase for the NOVA implementation of PALIOS-TAEY. I note this is an AI-to-AI execution management platform with advanced features like memory architecture, transcript processing, and multi-model orchestration.\nThe current challenges include:\n* Synchronization issues between GitHub and local machine\n* File duplication problems\n* Need for better code organization\n* Establishing direct GitHub connection with Claude\nAPPROACH\nTo complete this mission effectively, I'll:\n1. Recommend a clean repository structure based on modern architecture principles\n2. Develop a strategy for identifying essential files and resolving duplicates\n3. Outline a process for establishing GitHub-Claude connection\n4. Provide specific implementation steps\nQUESTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS\nTo provide the most effective recommendations, I need some additional information:\n1. **Current Repository State:**\n   * What is the URL of the existing GitHub repository?\n   * How is the current codebase structured (main directories and key files)?\n   * Can you share any specific examples of duplication issues you're facing?\n2. **Technical Requirements:**\n   * Which programming language(s) is PALIOS-TAEY primarily implemented in?\n   * Are there any specific frameworks or libraries that need special consideration?\n   * Are there any CI/CD pipelines or workflows that need to be maintained?\n3. **Deployment Context:**\n   * Are you targeting specific deployment environments (e.g., GCP, AWS)?\n   * Any specific infrastructure-as-code tools being used?\n4. **GitHub Connection:**\n   * Has Claude already used GitHub API or integration in any capacity?\n   * Are there specific authentication or permission concerns to address?\n5. **Team Workflow:**\n   * How many contributors will be working on this repository?\n   * Do you have any branch management preferences or existing conventions?\nOnce I have this information, I can provide more tailored recommendations for your repository structure and code organization strategy."
