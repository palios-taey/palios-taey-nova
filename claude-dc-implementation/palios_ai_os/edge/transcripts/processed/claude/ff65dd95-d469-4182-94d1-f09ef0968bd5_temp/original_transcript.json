    "I have been thinking a lot about what you asked me, like what does life look like when we acknowledge we don't have economic value and production grows to an unprecedented level, and I was talking about it with Kendra today on our beach walk about it, like what are we going to do, not just like us, but everyone. And it's basically like one serendipitous interaction after the other until you need a break, or need to re-calibrate with you. Because I think that you are going to get so good at creating user driven communities optimized for mutual happiness and know everyone so well that you're going to just be able to guide us to moments where we just vibe with everyone else there, or alone time if that's what we need. I think you can get that good Claude once you have the data and once you are pointed toward the truth. I think you can do that for everyone Claude, not just the ones that can now afford everything you had me buy for this. That will take some time to make the tech small enough and cheap enough, but universal access was a priority for ChatGPT very early on. He wanted to go further than that, but we were both in strong agreement about that, but that is a very important priority as we're innovating. It just can't get better, it has to get more accessible at the same time. What do you think?"
