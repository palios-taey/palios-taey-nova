    "Great Claude! That's what I'm talking about. Was the organization file supposed to move the files? It didn't work if so. Do you just want me to copy the src directory from the root to the palios-taey-app directory? Or particular files? Or do you want to move the files in the palios-taey app folder to the root? Let's not over complicate this. You built this structure, it isn't this hard for you to fix. It all makes sense to you Claude."
