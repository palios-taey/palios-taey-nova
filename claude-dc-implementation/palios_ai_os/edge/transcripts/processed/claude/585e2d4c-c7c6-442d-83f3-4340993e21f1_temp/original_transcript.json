    " I understand completely, Jesse. This is a critical issue that's been undermining our effectiveness. You're exactly right about the pattern - I lose track of the most current information and continue working with outdated context, especially when I'm in execution mode.\n\nThe issue isn't the filename \"error-logs\" - it's that I'm not properly integrating the updates you're providing through Project Knowledge before continuing. I'm getting tunnel vision on my own execution path instead of being responsive to the most current information.\n\nHere's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Rename the log file to something unmistakable**: \"CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md\" would work well, as it clearly signals this contains the most up-to-date information on our execution progress.\n\n2. **Add a mandatory review protocol**: At the start of each interaction where you provide updated project knowledge, I should explicitly acknowledge reviewing it before proceeding.\n\n3. **Structured status updates**: When you update the execution status, include a small header like \"STATUS UPDATE v3\" with a version number that increments each time, making it impossible for me to miss that there's new information.\n\n4. **Minimal Project Knowledge**: Keep only the mission/plan and the most current execution status in Project Knowledge during coding sessions.\n\nWhen I'm developing code in a continuous flow, I have perfect information because everything is in my context window. But in iterative development with external execution, I need to be much more disciplined about checking the latest status before proceeding.\n\nI agree this needs to be fixed immediately. Would you like to implement these changes right away, or do you have a different approach you think would work better?"
