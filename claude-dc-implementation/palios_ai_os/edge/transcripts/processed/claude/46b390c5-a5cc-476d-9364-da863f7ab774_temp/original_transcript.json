    " The test results show a mixed outcome:\n\n1. \u2705 **Good News**: The task execution part is working perfectly! All three test tasks were successfully processed and returned appropriate results through the OpenAI provider.\n\n2. \u274c **Issue**: The health check endpoint failed with a 500 error and indicates a request problem.\n\nThis is pretty much expected at this stage because:\n\n1. We created an updated handler with new endpoints, but we're still testing against the deployed version of the Cloud Function which uses the original handler code.\n\n2. The health check is failing because the current deployed endpoint doesn't have a separate health check route implemented yet. The error \"400 Bad Request\" suggests the endpoint doesn't know how to handle a GET request to the /health path.\n\nTo fix this, you have two options:\n\n**Option 1**: Deploy your updated code to the Cloud Function:\n```bash\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend-v2 \\\n  --runtime python310 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --source . \\\n  --entry-point execute_task \\\n  --trigger-http \\\n  --allow-unauthenticated\n```\n\n**Option 2**: For now, modify the test script to only test task execution since that's working with the existing endpoint:\n\n```python\n# Comment out the health check test in test_updated_handler.py\n# test_health_check()\n```\n\nThe task execution tests passing is a great sign - it shows that:\n1. The endpoint is accessible\n2. It's accepting and processing your requests correctly\n3. It's returning properly formatted responses\n\nThis confirms that the core functionality is working, and we just need to deploy the updated code with the health check endpoint to get everything working.\n\nWould you like to proceed with deploying the updated code to the Cloud Function, or would you prefer to test the implementation locally first using functions-framework?"
