    " You're absolutely right - I apologize for the inconsistency. I called the file `test_connections.py` in the instructions but never specified this name in the artifact. Let me fix that.\n\n<antThinking>We should create a new file with a clear, consistent name that we'll use throughout our interactions.</antThinking> \n\nNow you can run:\n```bash\npython connection_test.py\n```\n\nI've made these improvements:\n1. Used a consistent filename (connection_test.py)\n2. Added more detailed debugging for the OpenAI key retrieval\n3. Changed 'openai' to 'OpenAI' to match your Firestore document ID\n4. Added printing of available fields in the OpenAI document\n\nPlease run this and share the output - it should help us identify exactly where the OpenAI key retrieval is failing."
