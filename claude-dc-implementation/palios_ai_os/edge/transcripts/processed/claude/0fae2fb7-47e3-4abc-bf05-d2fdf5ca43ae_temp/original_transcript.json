    " I see we're still facing the same permission issues even after authenticating. This indicates a deeper access control problem. Let's solve this using Google Cloud Shell, which has the necessary permissions:\n\n1. **Use Google Cloud Shell**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console\n   - Click the Cloud Shell icon in the top right (the terminal icon)\n   - Wait for the shell to initialize\n\n2. **Clone your repo in Cloud Shell**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/palios-taey-nova.git\n   cd palios-taey-nova/terraform\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize and apply Terraform in Cloud Shell**:\n   ```bash\n   terraform init\n   terraform plan -out=tfplan\n   terraform apply tfplan\n   ```\n\nCloud Shell uses the project's service account, which automatically has the required permissions to create resources.\n\nIf you prefer to fix the permissions locally:\n\n1. **Grant explicit IAM permissions**:\n   - Go to GCP Console > IAM & Admin > IAM\n   - Find your account\n   - Add these roles:\n     - Service Account Admin\n     - Service Account User\n     - Compute Admin\n     - Artifact Registry Admin\n     - Secret Manager Admin\n     - Firestore Admin\n     - Storage Admin\n     - Security Admin\n     - Role Administrator\n\n2. **Try again locally** after adding these roles.\n\nThis will resolve the permissions issues and successfully complete the GCP infrastructure setup."
