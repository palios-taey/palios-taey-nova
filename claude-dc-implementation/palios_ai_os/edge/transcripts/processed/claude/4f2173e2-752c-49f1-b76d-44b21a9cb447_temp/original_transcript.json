    "So I really don't have an understanding of what NEEDS to be cleaned up, I can only share the context with you. CTO Claude was cranking through a bunch of files and wasn't specifying directories and it looked to me like similar files had different names and things like the history/historian thing popped out. You know better than me. I know he went through a lot to capture the Neo moments because this was our first use of Rosetta Stone and a lot of the other files seemed relevant too, but I don't know now based on the revisions you did. That chat hit its max though so I can't ask him. What do you think? Can you figure it out by reviewing them? Feel free to do it in chunks if you need to come back and figure it out in a few prompts because there's a lot of material."
