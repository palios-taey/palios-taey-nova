    "Ok, can you look at that file? This is at the top: def *get*collection(self, collection_name: str) -> firestore.CollectionReference:\n\nThis is followed by what looks like is the header. What happened is that Claude was editing that document. I notice that sometimes you start in the wrong spot when going back into documents. Can you do a review of that file, keeping that in mind that there might be a few things mixed up, but you should be able to figure it out. If the rest is good and I just have to delete that line at the top, then I can do that and re-add/push."
