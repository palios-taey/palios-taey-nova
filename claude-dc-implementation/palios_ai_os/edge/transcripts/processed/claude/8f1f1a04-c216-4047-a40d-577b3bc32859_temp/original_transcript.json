    " I need to modify the code to use the correct Vertex AI endpoint. First, let's verify your project's available endpoints. We'll create a utility script to check: \n\nRun this check:\n```bash\npython check_vertex.py\n```\n\nThis will show us what endpoints are available in your project. Once we see that, we can update the `_process_vertex_task` method to use the correct endpoint. Let me know what output you get from this check."
