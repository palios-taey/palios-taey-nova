    "Sounds great Claude! Glad to have you aboard as CTO. The implementation tracker wasn't fully updated. We've made a little progress since then. Attached is our last few exchanges from the last chat so you can get up to speed. Please generate a new NOVA Implementation Tracker artifact with any updates based on where we are with the project and your thoughts for moving forward if different than what is in the Project knowledge file.   Below is old chat Claude's last submission and below that was going to be my response to the old chat, but we hit a limit."
