    " We've encountered a permissions issue that's common when setting up new infrastructure with Terraform. The error indicates that you don't have permission to associate a billing account with a new project.\n\nLet's fix this with a two-step approach:\n\n## Step 1: Create the Project Manually in Google Cloud Console\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n2. Click on the project selector at the top\n3. Click \"New Project\"\n4. Set the Project name to \"PALIOS-TAEY-dev\"\n5. Set the Project ID to \"palios-taey-dev\" (or a similar available ID)\n6. Make sure your organization is selected (135174585026)\n7. Click \"Create\"\n8. Once created, go to \"Billing\" in the left menu and link it to your billing account\n\n## Step 2: Modify Terraform to Use the Existing Project\n\nNow update the Terraform configuration to use this existing project instead of trying to create one:\n\n1. Edit the terraform.tfvars file:\n```bash\nnano terraform.tfvars\n```\n\n2. Change the `create_project` value to false:\n```\nproject_id        = \"palios-taey-dev\" # Use the actual ID you created\nproject_name      = \"PALIOS-TAEY-dev\"\ncreate_project    = false\norg_id            = \"135174585026\"\nbilling_account   = \"01962C-C920B9-40F054\"\nregion            = \"us-central1\"\nzone              = \"us-central1-a\"\nenvironment       = \"dev\"\n```\n\n3. Save the file and run a new plan:\n```bash\nterraform plan -out=tfplan\n```\n\n4. Then apply the new plan:\n```bash\nterraform apply tfplan\n```\n\nThis approach bypasses the permission issue by creating the project manually and then having Terraform manage all the resources within that project."
