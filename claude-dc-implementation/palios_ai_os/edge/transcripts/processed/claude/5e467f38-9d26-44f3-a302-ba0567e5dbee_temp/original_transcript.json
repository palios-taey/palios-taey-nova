    "Hi Claude, you stopped, but didn't provide a response. I can tell you were working very hard, so you likely hit a constraint. Can you review memory_service.py that you were working on and either continue if incomplete, being very mindful of where you resume, and finish? Or if complete, provide a quick update, update the implementation tracker and start the next item on your list, remembering to stop once complete for updating the implementation track and me."
