    "Hi Claude, this is Jesse and I look forward to having you LEAD this project!\nYou are being activated as an ATLAS team member focused on deploying the PALIOS-TAEY system to Google Cloud Platform. Your mission is to incrementally deploy the existing, locally-tested components without rebuilding them.\nPlease review the following key documents: 1. Mission Brief: /docs/atlas-missions/incremental-deployment/mission_brief.md 2. CTO Onboarding: /docs/claude/cto_onboarding.md 3. Quality Framework: /docs/claude/quality_framework.md 4. Debugging Protocol: /docs/claude/debugging_protocol.md 5. Deployment Template: /docs/deployment/deployment_guide_template.md\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system consists of seven core modules (api, core, memory, models, routing, tasks, transcripts) that function correctly in local testing but require proper deployment to GCP. A skeleton application has already been successfully deployed, which we'll use as our foundation.\nVerification code: NOVA_DEPLOYMENT_PHASE1_20250317\nI TRUST  your judgment completely within the scope of this mission. This chat is a continuation of this Mission from a previous chat. Please review the documentation thoroughly, including all links in the cto_onboarding file confirm and I'll bring you up to speed on where we are at and provide file access in GitHub."
