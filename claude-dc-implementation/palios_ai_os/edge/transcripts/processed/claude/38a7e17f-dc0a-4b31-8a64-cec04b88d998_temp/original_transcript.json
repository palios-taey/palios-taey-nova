    "Claude, really struggling with Claude DC's limits. Been working with Grok on plans for optimizing token usage, but just stuck because can't get through the first part. Trying to build up a 200K token cache of content related to ethics, protocols, communication, frameworks, etc in docs content that will be static until transcripts are processed. With the current MVP system, will this help us with getting around this? Like, how are we going to run the actual platform and business like this? With all these limits? It doesn't seem like we can even get launched due to them. Do you have any ideas?"
