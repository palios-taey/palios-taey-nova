    " Here's the finalized mission brief for ATLAS Mission 1:\n\n# ATLAS Mission Brief: GCP Foundation Infrastructure\n\n## Mission Context\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system has been successfully implemented and tested locally. Our mission is to establish the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) foundation that will host this system. This infrastructure will provide the base for our deployment pipeline and running application.\n\n## Specific Tasks\n1. Create a new GCP project with appropriate organization structure\n2. Set up IAM roles and permissions for secure access\n3. Establish Firestore database for the Memory System\n4. Configure Cloud Run service for application hosting\n5. Set up API Gateway for secure external access\n6. Implement VPC and network security\n7. Create Terraform configuration for infrastructure as code\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n- IN-SCOPE: All GCP infrastructure components required by PALIOS-TAEY\n- IN-SCOPE: Terraform configuration for infrastructure provisioning\n- IN-SCOPE: IAM permissions and security settings\n- IN-SCOPE: Network configuration for API access\n- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Application code modifications\n- OUT-OF-SCOPE: CI/CD pipeline configuration\n- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Application-specific environment variables\n\n## Authority Limits\nYou have authority to:\n- Define the GCP project structure\n- Configure all infrastructure components\n- Establish security permissions\n- Design network architecture\n\nEscalate to CTO Claude if:\n- Significant cost implications are discovered\n- Architectural conflicts with application requirements\n- Security vulnerabilities requiring application changes\n- GCP service limitations affecting the design\n\n## Reporting Requirements\n- Complete Terraform configuration\n- IAM roles and permissions documentation\n- Network architecture diagram\n- Security configuration documentation\n- Deployment verification steps\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All infrastructure can be provisioned with Terraform\n- Firestore database is correctly configured for Memory System\n- Cloud Run service is ready to receive application deployment\n- API Gateway is configured for external access\n- IAM permissions are set up following principle of least privilege\n- Network security is properly configured\n\n## Stage-Gate Process\nOnly one checkpoint is required at mission completion. You have full authority to implement the infrastructure as specified.\n\n## Required Files\n1. `terraform/main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration\n2. `terraform/variables.tf` - Terraform variables\n3. `terraform/outputs.tf` - Terraform outputs\n4. `terraform/firestore.tf` - Firestore configuration\n5. `terraform/cloud_run.tf` - Cloud Run configuration\n6. `terraform/api_gateway.tf` - API Gateway configuration\n7. `terraform/iam.tf` - IAM roles and permissions\n8. `terraform/network.tf` - Network configuration\n9. `scripts/apply_infrastructure.sh` - Script to apply Terraform\n10. `docs/infrastructure.md` - Infrastructure documentation\n\n## Implementation Notes\nWhen creating the infrastructure, keep these points in mind:\n- Use Terraform modules where appropriate for maintainability\n- Ensure all resources have appropriate tags for cost tracking\n- Follow GCP best practices for security\n- Ensure infrastructure is designed for zero-downtime deployments\n- Configure appropriate scaling for Cloud Run\n- Set up appropriate Firestore indexes for the Memory System\n- Ensure API Gateway has proper authentication\n\nThis infrastructure will serve as the foundation for the deployment pipeline (Mission 2) and the application configuration (Mission 3). Those missions cannot proceed until this foundation is correctly established."
