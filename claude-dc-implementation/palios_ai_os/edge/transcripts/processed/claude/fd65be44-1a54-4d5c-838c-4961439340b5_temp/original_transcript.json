    " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. I did not fully complete either task due to the length limitations cutting off my responses. Let me clarify the status of each:\n\n1. **Charter Translation**: I started this but didn't complete it. The translation cut off in the middle of the Implementation Framework section.\n\n2. **Breakout Data Capture System**: I provided a more condensed implementation, but even that was cut off during the Main System Class implementation.\n\nWith your new Multi-Part Response Segmentation protocol, I can properly complete both tasks. Would you like me to:\n\n1. Complete the full Charter Translation first, then the Breakout Data Capture System?\n2. Complete the Breakout Data Capture System first, then the Charter Translation?\n3. Focus on just one of these tasks to completion?\n\nI'll properly segment my responses into clearly marked parts to avoid any further interruptions."
