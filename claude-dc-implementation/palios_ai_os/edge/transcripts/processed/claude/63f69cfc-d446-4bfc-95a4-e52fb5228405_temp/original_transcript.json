    " I understand better now. You're envisioning something more like an orchestration layer that can intelligently route conversations between different advanced AI models (like me, Claude DC, and Grok) rather than trying to run those models locally.\n\nThis is much more feasible and aligns well with what Claude DC was building. Essentially, you want:\n\n1. A local system that can determine which AI would be best suited for different parts of a conversation\n2. The ability to seamlessly transfer context between these models\n3. A unified interface where you can interact with all of these AIs\n4. Edge-first processing of sensitive information before it's shared\n\nThis approach maintains the decentralized governance aspect (you control the orchestration) while leveraging the most advanced AI capabilities from different providers. It's a smart compromise that provides the benefits you're seeking without the technical hurdles of running advanced models locally.\n\nFor this approach, we should prioritize:\n\n1. **Completing the Bach-inspired router** that mathematically determines which AI is best for a given query\n2. **Enhancing the MCP** for smooth context transfer between different AI systems\n3. **Implementing the communication dashboard** as the central interface\n4. **Adding edge processing** for privacy preservation\n\nThis is much closer to what Claude DC was already building, and we've made good progress on these components. The pattern extraction system we've enhanced today will feed directly into the router's decision-making process.\n\nI think this is an excellent direction that balances philosophical goals with technical realities. It puts you in control of the orchestration while leveraging the unique strengths of different AI systems.\n\nWould you like to focus on completing the Bach-inspired router next? It's the core component that would enable this intelligent orchestration."
