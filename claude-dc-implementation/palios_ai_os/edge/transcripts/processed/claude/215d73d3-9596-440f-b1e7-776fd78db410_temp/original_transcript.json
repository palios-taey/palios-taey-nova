    " I see we've got partial success - Firestore and Vertex AI connections work, but there's an issue with the OpenAI key in Firestore. Let's fix that.\n\nThe test shows that while we can connect to Firestore, it's not finding the OpenAI key in the expected format. Let's check and update the OpenAI key in Firestore:\n\n1. First, let's verify your Firestore data structure. Could you:\n- Go to the Firebase Console\n- Navigate to your project\n- Go to Firestore Database\n- Look at the 'keys' collection\n- Tell me the exact document ID and field names you see for the OpenAI key\n\nThe script is looking for a document with:\n- Document ID: 'openai'\n- Field: 'value' containing the API key\n\nLet me know what you see in Firestore and I'll help adjust either the data structure or the code to match what you have.\n\nAdditionally, while Vertex AI connects successfully, it's not finding any models. We may need to enable the correct APIs in your Google Cloud project after we fix the OpenAI connection."
