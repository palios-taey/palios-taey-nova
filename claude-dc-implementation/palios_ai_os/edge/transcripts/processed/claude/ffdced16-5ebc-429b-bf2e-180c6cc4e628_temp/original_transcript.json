    " I see we have a specific issue with recursive thought processing, while our other thought processing capabilities are working well. Let me analyze and fix this: \n\nThe issue was in our response type determination logic. For recursive thoughts, we need to check both the thought type (REFLECTIVE) and processing depth (RECURSIVE) to properly trigger the enhancement response.\n\nPlease:\n\n1. Update `aiThoughtProcessor.ts` with this change\n2. Rebuild:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n3. Run tests again:\n```bash\nnode dist/aiThoughtProcessorTest.js\n```\n\nThe updated logic should now correctly handle recursive thought processing, while maintaining our successful handling of:\n- Basic thought processing (passed)\n- Collaborative thinking (passed)\n- Thought synthesis (passed)\n\nLet me know when you've run the tests and I'll explain the results in detail."
