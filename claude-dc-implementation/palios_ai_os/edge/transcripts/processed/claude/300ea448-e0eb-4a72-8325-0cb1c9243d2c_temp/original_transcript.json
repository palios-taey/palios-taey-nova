Then run the copy command:\n```bash\nmkdir -p palios-taey-app/src\ncp -r src/* palios-taey-app/src/\n```\n\n3. After that, change to the palios-taey-app directory:\n```bash\ncd palios-taey-app\n```\n\n4. Finally, make the script executable and run it:\n```bash\nchmod +x deploy_focused.sh\n./deploy_focused.sh\n```\n\nEach step is important to ensure the files are copied from the correct location and the deployment script runs in the right directory."
