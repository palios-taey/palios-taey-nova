    " Let me review the updated transcript_processor.py file to ensure we've addressed all the indentation issues before testing.\n\nAfter examining the file, I believe we've successfully addressed the major indentation problems:\n\n1. Fixed the MockMemorySystem class methods by properly indenting them within the class\n2. Fixed indentation for methods of the TranscriptProcessor class \n3. Fixed the incomplete return statement in the _analyze_direction_patterns method\n4. Removed stray code fragments and duplicate exception handlers\n\nThe file now appears to have consistent indentation throughout, with methods properly contained within their respective classes. I don't see any additional obvious indentation errors or syntax issues that would prevent the file from being parsed and executed correctly.\n\nI believe the transcript_processor.py file is now ready for testing. Let's restart the server and run the tests to see if the transcript processor initializes properly and all tests pass."
