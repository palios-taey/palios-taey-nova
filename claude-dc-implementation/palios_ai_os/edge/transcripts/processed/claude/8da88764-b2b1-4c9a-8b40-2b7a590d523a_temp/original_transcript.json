    "Ok, will you be able to pull transcripts if I'm logged into all the different platforms? There are so many chats Claude. Your concept of time always amuses me, why would it take you a week to do that? It's almost like you put yourself into a human mindset when you make time estimations, like you think, \"If I was a human, how long would this take?\". If you just have the ability to go and do this, I'm guessing it would probably only take you like an hour, depending on how quickly APIs went out and came back with the structured transcript data. I'm also thinking that would take a few iterations with possible reprocessing to capture everything, but anyway, it's definitely not a week!"
