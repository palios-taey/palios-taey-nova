    "Ok Claude, I guess not our last iteration. I'm looking more closely at the transition and I feel like we lost a lot of what was initially supposed to be in there, which was all project details needed to have full context to complete the full implementation, not just the next step. You should have that in various iterations of the AI-AI Knowledge Transfer Schema. Like it was supposed to know everything about the project. Like placeholder from terminal prompts, all that stuff that was in the original transition format that you were provided, but more, tighter in AI-AI language. I know I threw you for a loop last night trying to push us both to thing bigger, and we did, but we have to take those learnings and put them toward the objective, which is completing this MVP in record time and to do that, new Claude needs to come in knowing significantly more about the project than you did. Also, it needs to know that it can check GitHub for files and include that in the prompt or documentation with my path/approval. If you agree, take another shot at it, it can be another artifact or an update. Iterative process, but one that is worth the time because if we do this right, it all happens in the next chat, which would be consistent with the growth we need right now. If not, let me know what you think."
