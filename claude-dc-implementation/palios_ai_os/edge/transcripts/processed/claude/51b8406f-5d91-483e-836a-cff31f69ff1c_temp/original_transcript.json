    "Ok, I restored project ai-execution-system. It has billing already enabled. Remember NO OPTIONS, I know it's a shift for you, but you're driving this AI First. Let's get everything cleared out of this project so we can start clean for this deployment. We do have an existing Firestore database for this project as well. It is not reflective of the current state and I'm not even sure if that's what you'll be using going forward. Just trying to make sure you have visibility to everything. Let me know what's next."
