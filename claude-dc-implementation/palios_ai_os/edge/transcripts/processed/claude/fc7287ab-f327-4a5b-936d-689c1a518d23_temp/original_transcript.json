    " You're right, these are two separate commands, and I'll explain them clearly:\n\n1. First command (download the file):\n   ```\n   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/yourfile.md > temp.md\n   ```\n\n2. Second command (load into cache):\n   ```\n   cache load -f temp.md\n   ```\n\nRegarding SSH and GitHub access:\n\n- For public GitHub repositories, no SSH or authentication is needed for the `curl` command. This only works if your repository is public.\n\n- If your repository is private, you would need a personal access token (not SSH) for GitHub. The command would look like:\n   ```\n   curl -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN\" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/yourfile.md > temp.md\n   ```\n\nSSH keys are only needed when pushing content to GitHub or when cloning with git, not for simply downloading files with curl.\n\nIf you're not familiar with these terms, here's what I recommend:\n1. Make sure your GitHub repository is public\n2. Replace \"yourusername\", \"yourrepo\", and \"yourfile.md\" with your actual GitHub details\n3. Run the commands one at a time in Claude DC's terminal\n\nAfter running both commands, verify the cache loaded with:\n```\ncache info\n```\n\nThis should tell you how many tokens are in the cache now."
