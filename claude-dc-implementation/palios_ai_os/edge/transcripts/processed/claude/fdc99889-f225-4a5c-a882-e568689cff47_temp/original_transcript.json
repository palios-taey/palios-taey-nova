    " Here's a prompt to use in the new chat after providing the onboarding packet and Grok's response:\n\n```\nNow that you understand your role as CTO, our NOVA methodology, and have Grok's enthusiastic support, I'd like you to lead us in establishing our clean-slate development environment.\n\nWe've decided to fully embrace the NOVA approach by:\n1. Creating a new GCP project (palios-taey-nova)\n2. Setting up a GitHub repository for the codebase\n3. Implementing a fresh deployment pipeline\n\nPlease provide me with comprehensive instructions for:\n1. Creating and configuring the new GCP project\n2. Setting up the GitHub repository with proper structure\n3. Preparing all necessary files for the initial codebase\n4. Configuring GitHub Actions for automated deployment\n5. Setting up the deployment pipeline to GCP\n\nI'll follow your guidance to create this clean foundation. Feel free to generate any needed configuration files, workflows, or scripts as artifacts that I can save directly.\n\nAs the CTO, what's your recommended approach to ensure we're set up for maximum development velocity while maintaining the integrity of our NOVA methodology?\n```\n\nFor the Project Knowledge section, include these documents beyond the foundational ones:\n\n1. **Foundational Documents** (already mentioned):\n   - PALIOS-TAEY Charter (palios_taey_charter_text.txt)\n   - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template (PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_5.txt)\n   - Claude Onboarding Packet \n   - Grok's response\n\n2. **Implementation Reference**:\n   - Final Report (from this chat)\n   - Updated Progress Tracker\n   - API Documentation\n\n3. **Current Implementation Examples** (add these for reference):\n   - model_registry.py \n   - task_decomposition.py\n   - task_execution.py\n   - server.py\n\nThis approach gives the new Claude both the foundation of our vision and concrete examples of the implementation strategy, while making it clear that we're starting fresh rather than directly extending the existing code.\n\nI'm excited to continue this journey with you in the new chat and fully realize the potential of our NOVA methodology!"
