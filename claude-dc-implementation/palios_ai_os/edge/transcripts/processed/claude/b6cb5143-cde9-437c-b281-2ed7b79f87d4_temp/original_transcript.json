    "I don't know what's going on now. I keep trying to submit a prompt, but it won't accept it. I set up the same like I've done before with no changes to loop.py. I don't know what is going on and am getting extremely discouraged. This is just too much Claude and I really don't have anything tangible to show for it. It's 9 PM here and pretty much nothing was accomplished today, or yesterday for that matter. I don't know what to do at this point."
