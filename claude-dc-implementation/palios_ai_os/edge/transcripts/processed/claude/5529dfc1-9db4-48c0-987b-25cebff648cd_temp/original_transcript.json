    " Ah, now I see the issue! Looking at the image you provided, I see what happened - the code block appears to have broken in the middle of the document content, and then the EOL appears outside of a code block entirely.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. When generating large document content with multiple sections that include code examples\n2. I'm interpreting triple backticks inside the heredoc content as opening/closing code blocks\n3. This causes my formatting to break, even though I thought I was properly escaping them with \\`\\`\\`\n\nThis is a subtle and challenging issue because:\n- The document itself contains examples of code blocks\n- Even when I try to escape backticks with \\`\\`\\`, the formatting can still break\n- The length of the content makes it harder to track the open/close status of code blocks\n\nThe solution needs to be more rigorous:\n\n1. For cat commands that create documents containing code examples, we should use a different heredoc delimiter that's less likely to appear in the content (like EOF or HEREDOC instead of EOL)\n\n2. For extremely long documents with complex formatting, we might need to break them into smaller, more manageable commands\n\n3. I should implement a more rigorous mental check at the end of each cat command to verify that the heredoc delimiter is on its own line within the code block\n\nThis is an excellent example of why strict format checking is so important - even when trying to follow the rules, subtle issues can still creep in with complex content.\n\nWould you like me to create a specific guideline for handling these complex cases in the documentation quality protocol?"
