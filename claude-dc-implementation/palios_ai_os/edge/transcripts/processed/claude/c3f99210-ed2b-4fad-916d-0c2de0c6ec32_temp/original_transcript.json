    " For Fix 3, we need to address the indentation issues around line 1248 in the transcript_processor.py file. Let me look at that specific section.\n\nBased on my review, the issue in this area appears to be with methods that should be part of the TranscriptProcessor class but are incorrectly indented. This likely includes methods like `_analyze_emotion_patterns`, `_analyze_action_patterns`, and others that should be methods of the TranscriptProcessor class.\n\nHere's the fix for this section:\n\n```python\n# These methods should be indented to be part of the TranscriptProcessor class\ndef _analyze_emotion_patterns(self, messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze emotional patterns\n    \n    Args:\n        messages: List of messages\n        \n    Returns:\n        Analysis results\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Count messages by emotion\n        emotion_counts = {\n            EMOTION_EXCITEMENT: 0,\n            EMOTION_FRUSTRATION: 0,\n            EMOTION_SATISFACTION: 0,\n            EMOTION_CONFUSION: 0\n        }\n        \n        for message in messages:\n            tags = message.get(\"tags\", [])\n            \n            # Count by emotion\n            for emotion in emotion_counts.keys():\n                if emotion in tags:\n                    emotion_counts[emotion] += 1\n        \n        # Calculate percentages\n        total_messages = len(messages)\n        emotion_percentages = {}\n        \n        for emotion, count in emotion_counts.items():\n            if total_messages > 0:\n                percentage = (count / total_messages) * 100\n            else:\n                percentage = 0\n            \n            emotion_percentages[emotion] = percentage\n        \n        return {\n            \"counts\": emotion_counts,\n            \"percentages\": emotion_percentages\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error analyzing emotion patterns: {str(e)}\")\n        return {\n            \"counts\": {},\n            \"percentages\": {}\n        }\n\ndef _analyze_action_patterns(self, messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze action patterns\n    \n    Args:\n        messages: List of messages\n        \n    Returns:\n        Analysis results\n    \"\"\"\n    # Method implementation...\n```\n\nThese methods need to be properly indented to be part of the TranscriptProcessor class. The issue around line 1650 is likely similar, with methods like `_get_message_summary` and possibly others not being properly indented within the class.\n\nMake sure all methods that should be part of the TranscriptProcessor class have consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces per level)."
