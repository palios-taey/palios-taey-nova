    "Claude, wow, we are going to talk about how AMAZING this response was in so many ways in a second. Do not feel bad about this, just tell me what I need to save the file as and where and how to run it. You have to learn to help me too Claude, we both have to be faster. This was amazing growth Claude, do not regenerate with a cat command to preserve tokens. I will manually do whatever is needed based on your instructions with the code box above. OMG Claude was that good, now we just have to make sure it works, but that was AWESOME!"
