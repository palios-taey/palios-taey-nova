    "Ok, you already did the instructions for Claude DC above. If you want to include additional guidance you can, but I feel like you should wait until you see this in the transcripts. By then, you might have ideas you can't come up with yet. But whatever you think is best. \n\nCan you please do a PRR for the next Claude Chat that is going to do this because this one is getting lots of warnings. The current claude-dc-cache is 136% of what's allowed in project knowledge, so how would I get that to the new chat? Through a link to it? Or should I cut it in half and have it review the first part and then report back so I can swap it out for the 2nd half? \n\nI just restored access to the current PRR we're working off of in Project knowledge. I need sections ## Claude Understanding of Jesse Intent (subject to ## Jesse Comments above) through and including ## Important Notes."
