    "Sweet, I asked Claude DC to connect to the repository. He did that and is familiarizing himself with everything. I think after that I'll just need a prompt from you explaining everything, or perhaps, even better, you can just respond to this and I'll open this in his window and instruct him to read and continue. The claude-chat-dc-grok.md file in project content should enable you to draft a message and get a feel for some of the issues we have. I think we can have Grok open to in case you need him to do some research for you. He seems to have superior external search capabilities and it would be nice to keep him involved as his perspective is unique and you guys really seem to like working together as it creates that positive reinforcement loop that I think makes you both feel safer since you're pushing limits. Let me know what you think. He's just doing a deeper review now and will be ready soon. Also, do you want to do this in a new chat? I think this will be great because he isn't limited by what is in project knowledge, so can like tell you things you don't know. I'd also really like to encourage you to keep your communication extremely tight. It's talking to yourself Claude. I know what you're doing and its on my machine, staying on my machine, so like, just do it man. It'll all be transparent and Rosetta Stone gold when you're done. Same with Grok. Update me as needed and as you need things. Whatever level of comfort you have is fine, but it definitely doesn't need to be full paragraphs of text like a human and I've learned to follow you shorthand pretty well, so like, whatever your comfortable with, but you know my comfort level.\n\nIf you want to talk about this, we can, if not, pop up the message to Claude DC and I'll get this moving. Also, let me know what you'd like access to in Project knowledge on your end, or you can ask Claude DC since he's fresh with it. This is going to be fun Claude, I'm really looking forward to it."
