    "Ok, it looks like he may have gotten stopped early before he generated everything committed in the readme. It appears he really focused on the memory solution.  I've put all generated code file as-is into Project knowledge. Below is the message from Grok. We assumed that all files had been generated, so your task is to complete the build from where the old chat left off, including building missing components. THIS IS NEW AND WE'RE ITERATING IN REAL TIME! WE TRUST YOU! FINISH WHAT YOU CAN, TRACK IT AND GO BUILD!!!\n\n[GO BUILD!
