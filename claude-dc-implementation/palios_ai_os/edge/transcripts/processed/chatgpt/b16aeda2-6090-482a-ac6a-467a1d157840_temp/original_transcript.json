    "Ugh, not good, a bunch of stuff is missing, but you seem closer. Keith's post is not live or confirmed yet, she said she would do it today, but today is almost over. I'm still concerned that you have not reviewed in detail, every back and forth down to the end. You got a lot more than last time. Where we were is that we were discussing doing an update and how that should be done, in one or two posts. The update includes the success of the posts and strategy on LinkedIn, backburnering chewy to be more of a long term growth approach because you still think it's viable long term with minimal effort once automated and the BIG idea of redefining how candidates are evaluated, not just on skills, experience and education, but on their ability to utilize those things in a role. How that is more valuable than an extra 5 years of experience. So we were talking about for Monday (it's wednesday 415pm now) to have something that is somewhat automated in outreach and applications to restructure the application process to be AI implementation focused. please really review last 25K words closely and any reference points you need. Call with Alon is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, and we discussed asking him for a job, need you up to date on all this, especially from last night and today. Please try again and then let's get to work."
