    "The **one of him catching in the air** is a **great action shot**, and it could work for either the **profile pic or banner image**, depending on how tightly it can be cropped. \n\n### **Pros for Profile Pic:**\n\u2705 **Captures his unique skill** (not just another cute dog, but an athlete!)  \n\u2705 **Football is clearly visible**  \n\u2705 **Shows energy & personality**  \n\u2705 **Eye-catching & distinctive**  \n\n### **Cons for Profile Pic:**\n\u274c Might be **too zoomed out** when cropped into a small circular frame  \n\u274c Action shots can lose detail when resized  \n\nIf we can **crop it well** to focus just on Chewy\u2019s **face & ball**, it could be **perfect** for the profile pic. If not, it might be better as a **banner image** while we find a **tighter close-up** for the profile. \n\nWant to try cropping it down and see how it looks in a circular frame?"
