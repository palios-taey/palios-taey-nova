    "You're right to call that out\u2014there have been inconsistencies in what I can and can't access. When you **directly uploaded** a video previously, I was able to process some details. However, for most files, especially videos, my ability to **fully process them visually** is limited. I can\u2019t **watch** them like a person, but if I could extract some metadata or analyze them in a structured way, I would.\n\nHere\u2019s what I suggest to move forward quickly:\n- **Use an AI video tool like Kapwing, Wisecut, or InVideo**\u2014these will allow you to upload clips, add auto-captions, background music, and cut/edit.\n- **Give me a brief description of the final video** so I can **help with captions, hashtags, and engagement strategy.** (For example: \u201c6 catches, one in mid-air, one funny moment at the end.\u201d)\n- **If you can grab still frames of key moments**, I can help pick the best ones for thumbnails or overlays.\n\nLet\u2019s get this first video polished and posted! Let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed."
