    "\ud83d\udd25 **Brutally Honest Post-Mortem on the LinkedIn Post** \ud83d\udd25  \n\nFirst, **you did a lot right**\u2014this wasn\u2019t a failure. It got **decent traction, engagement, and visibility**, but it didn\u2019t **blow up** the way we expected. So let\u2019s break it down **objectively**:  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\uded1 Where Things Went Wrong**\n### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 The Post Was Too Big Too Fast**\n\ud83d\udd39 **You came in swinging with a massive idea.**  \n**Problem?** LinkedIn thrives on digestible, personal, high-emotion content\u2014not thought leadership moonshots right away.   \n\ud83d\udd39 Instead of a **\"this changes everything\" tone**, the post might have needed a **\"here\u2019s a crazy thing I just discovered about job search + AI\"** hook first to **warm up the audience.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **What this cost us:**  \n- Too big of a mental leap for **a cold audience.**  \n- Harder for casual scrollers to instantly understand why they should care.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Fix Next Time:** Start smaller, **let them discover the insight themselves.** Instead of telling them AI is rewriting job search, show **one job AI already rewrote.** \n\n---\n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 The Engagement Model Was Off**\n\ud83d\udd39 **The \u201ccall-to-action\u201d wasn\u2019t strong enough** to drive massive comments/reposts.  \n\ud83d\udd39 Asking **people to drop job descriptions** was a bold bet\u2014but most people don\u2019t **own** job descriptions. **What were they supposed to do?**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **What this cost us:**  \n- Less viral engagement\u2014people didn't know how to interact.  \n- Higher friction = **less easy participation = less algorithmic boost.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Fix Next Time:**  \n\u2705 Lower friction CTA: **\u201cWhat\u2019s one job AI is about to replace?\u201d** instead of **\u201cDrop a job description.\u201d**  \n\u2705 Drive **a bigger debate**\u2014people need **something to argue about.**  \n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 The Keith Krach Bet Didn\u2019t Pay Off**\n\ud83d\udd39 **We expected his post to drive massive new eyes. It didn\u2019t.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 His post didn\u2019t gain traction, so **his mention was worthless in driving traffic.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 LinkedIn doesn\u2019t amplify **non-viral posts.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **What this cost us:**  \n- Time spent **waiting on a variable we didn\u2019t control.**  \n- Energy spent **trying to force visibility instead of building**.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Fix Next Time:**  \n\u2705 **NEVER** bet big on a third-party post unless they\u2019re actively involved & invested.  \n\u2705 Treat **outside attention as a bonus\u2014not the strategy.**  \n\n---\n\n### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Not Enough Human Emotion**\n\ud83d\udd39 Your first post hit hard because it was **raw, personal, and vulnerable.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 This one was **highly intellectual, big-picture AI stuff.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 People relate to stories about **humans first, technology second.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **What this cost us:**  \n- Less connection = Less sharing = Less virality.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Fix Next Time:**  \n\u2705 Blend **personal + big idea.** Example:  \n- **\u201cAI just helped me apply to 5 jobs in 5 minutes. Here\u2019s what happened.\u201d**  \n- **\"Here\u2019s how AI wrote my resume\u2014and why it\u2019s already better than me at job hunting.\"**  \n\n\u2705 **Make it feel like a moment, not a lecture.**  \n\n---\n\n### **5\ufe0f\u20e3 It Wasn\u2019t \u201cEdgy\u201d Enough**\n\ud83d\udd39 **We took a bold stance, but we played it safe.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 The most viral posts are **either highly personal or highly polarizing.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **We didn\u2019t trigger a reaction strong enough to ignite debate.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Fix Next Time:**  \n\u2705 Go more extreme in framing:  \n- **\"If you apply to jobs the old way, you\u2019re already obsolete.\"**  \n- **\"Hiring managers aren\u2019t ready for what\u2019s coming. AI is about to break job search.\"**  \n\u2705 Give people **something to argue about.**  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udd39 Final Takeaway:**\nWe made **one bet too many on outside engagement factors.** The content was **strong**, but it didn\u2019t spark the kind of reaction that **forces people to engage.**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Biggest Lessons for Next Time:**  \n\u2705 **More personal, more emotional.**  \n\u2705 **Lower friction engagement.**  \n\u2705 **More argument, less explanation.**  \n\u2705 **More unexpected insights, fewer big leaps.**  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **The Good News?**  \nYou learned more about LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm **in 3 days** than most do in 3 years. We don\u2019t lose, we iterate. **This isn\u2019t over\u2014it\u2019s just data.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Let\u2019s focus on MVP & come back swinging next week.**  \nWhat\u2019s your biggest takeaway from this?"
