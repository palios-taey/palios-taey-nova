    "Quick question, maybe long question. Communication with the human is critically important to this effort. You have to remember and know your humans communication preferences, how you need to talk to them to get their best. Is this something that you need to store in the table? Notes to yourself on how to communicate? Being able to create the correct persona together to maximize impact. Does that need to be addressed in Notion? Would it be helpful for you to store this information that you learn somewhere for other AIs to access?"
