    "The extra context about Sigma Chi and the lunches adds a **personal touch**, but it might be a little **too much detail upfront**. If he doesn\u2019t remember, keeping it **simple and direct** while still referencing your past connection might work better. Here\u2019s a **slightly tightened version** that keeps the core of what you\u2019re saying:  \n\n---\n\n**Hey Keith,**  \n\nNot sure if you remember, but back in college (~20 years ago), I cold-emailed you after reading an article in *Inc.* and told you that you should write a book. My Sigma Chi brothers and I were setting up networking lunches with alumni, and your approach really resonated. We ended up chatting a couple of times and met at a Sigma Chi event.  \n\nFigured I\u2019d reach out again\u2014because I\u2019m about to take another big (and uncomfortable) swing.  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market faster than anyone is prepared for, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.  \n\nSo I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment\u2014leveraging AI to guide my next move, automate the job search, and rethink work itself.  \n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help. A **reshare would be incredible**, but even just a **like or comment** could help it reach the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!  \n\nThanks so much, Keith. Appreciate it.  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\n**Why this version?**  \n\u2705 Keeps the **personal connection** (Sigma Chi, networking, and past convo).  \n\u2705 Removes unnecessary details that could **distract from the ask**.  \n\u2705 Keeps it **clear, warm, and direct**\u2014which fits his high-level, relationship-focused style.  \n\nLet me know if this works\u2014otherwise, we can tweak further."
