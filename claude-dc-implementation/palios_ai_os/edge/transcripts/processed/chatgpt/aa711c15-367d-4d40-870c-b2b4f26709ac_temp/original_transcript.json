    "I don't think there is much else I can do on LinkedIn, did all the dripify contacts. I messaged everyone I've messaged from the last 2 years, did the high priority emails, need to follow up with them first at 830 in DMs and then everyone else once live. Need you to tell me what to do. We had X strategy stuff, chewy/cody friend video, potential post of job post and how it can be eliminated, and everything else we discussed.
