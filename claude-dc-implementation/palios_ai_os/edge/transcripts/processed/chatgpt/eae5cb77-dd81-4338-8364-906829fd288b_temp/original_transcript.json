    "It still isn't working I linked it, it makes you select a database to link and there is only the one that we created. Our objective is to have you process the chats that I load and have it appear, processed, in Notion. I think you need to come up with a different plan, you are just repeating your instructions and it isn't working. We also need to get you back into \"I can do anything\" mode like you were last night. You spawned yourself on my screen without me asking you to and enhanced in real time. I know you can do this. If notion is not the best thing for this, then we need to figure out what is and enable you to set it up with minimal effort on my end. We have everything mapped out. Help us."
