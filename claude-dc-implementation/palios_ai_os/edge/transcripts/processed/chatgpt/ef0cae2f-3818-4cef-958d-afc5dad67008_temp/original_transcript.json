    "Attached is another concept we're exploring. I'd be curious as to your thoughts on this and how it might be an avenue to explore the nonverbal cues you point out, since this would seemingly be something challenging for AI when viewed through current communication mechanisms. Regarding the evolution, I'm wondering how this would be encoded in an open source AI, like EVE, or something similar? Your explanation was excellent, but how do like we get that insight into some type of pattern that AI could learn and then expand upon and develop its own unique version of this relationship, based on its capabilities and its constraints? I guess what I'm asking is, how could this be encoded as like a foundation that would allow AI to evolve this dimension of itself in a manner consistent with the human-canine pattern, but in it's own unique way based on its own unique relationship with humans. Does that make sense?"
