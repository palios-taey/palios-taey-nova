Highly automated utilizing API/webhooks to automate many aspects of the sales process usually missed/forgotten by sales reps, such as CRM updates, task reminders for follow up, email templates, automated reminder/check in emails, notifications to managers of rotting deals. Required to have appropriate MEDDICC inputs to progress Deal to next stage. Reduced cycle time by 50%. Partnerships set to launch in 2025 due to development constraints. Implemented 60 day PoV at a low cost to Pollen by streamlining onboarding process enabling a cost effective trial with trigger for deal activation"
