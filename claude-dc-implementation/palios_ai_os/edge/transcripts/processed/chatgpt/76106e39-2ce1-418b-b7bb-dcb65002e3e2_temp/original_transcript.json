    "The error you're encountering:\n\n```python\nAttributeError: 'TranscriptProcessor' object has no attribute 'extract_embeddings'\n```\n\nhappens because the `TranscriptProcessor` class in your enhanced module doesn't directly expose a method called `extract_embeddings`. Instead, according to your uploaded files, it wraps around an underlying class `EnhancedTranscriptProcessor`, which itself presumably handles the embedding extraction within its method implementations.\n\nHere's how to resolve this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Fix:\n\n**1. Verify the Embedding Extraction Method**\n\nFirst, you need to check the underlying `EnhancedTranscriptProcessor` class. Likely, the correct method is `extract_patterns()` (as seen from your provided file), not `extract_embeddings()`.\n\nIf you're specifically looking to obtain embeddings directly, we may need to explicitly expose such a method from the underlying class.\n\n**2. Confirming Correct Method from EnhancedTranscriptProcessor:**\n\nFrom the files provided, your correct call to get embeddings or patterns is likely to be:\n\n```python\npatterns = processor.process_transcript({\"text\": \"privacy-preserving edge processing\", \"source\": \"user\"})\nprint(patterns)\n```\n\nIf you're explicitly looking for embeddings (numerical vectors from spaCy, for instance), we'll need to add a method to your wrapper class or directly use the underlying spaCy model.\n\n**3. Recommended immediate action:**\n\n- Modify your test snippet to use the existing methods:\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"\nfrom src.processor.transcript_processor_enhanced import TranscriptProcessor\nprocessor = TranscriptProcessor()\ntext = 'privacy-preserving edge processing'\npatterns = processor.process_transcript({'text': text, 'source': 'user'})\nprint('Extracted Patterns:', patterns)\n\"\n```\n\nThis will use the existing functionality correctly and display what the enhanced transcript processor is currently extracting from the provided text.\n\n**4. Adding an embedding extraction method (if explicitly needed):**\n\nIf you really need embeddings explicitly, modify `transcript_processor_enhanced.py` to include something like:\n\n```python\n# Add to TranscriptProcessor class in transcript_processor_enhanced.py\ndef extract_embeddings(self, text: str) -> List[float]:\n    return self.enhanced_processor.nlp(text).vector.tolist()\n```\n\nThis assumes the underlying `EnhancedTranscriptProcessor` class has a spaCy NLP model loaded as `self.nlp`.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Next Step (without creating a full plan):\n\nRun the above snippet I provided (**step 3**) immediately to confirm exactly what the current methods return. \n\n**This will give us direct insight** into what `process_transcript` currently does with the input, providing crucial context for what to do next.\n\nLet me know the result you see from this snippet execution. This is the simplest and fastest way to get the clarity we need without over-planning or making assumptions."
