    "So, I really think getting to resume, coverletter, and full submit with reporting, all files in central location with standard naming convention and at least a spreadsheet with jobs applied to information would be ideal, fallback would be quickly identifying jobs as they are posted and developing all the assets needed instantly for manual submission. I think both would add a lot of value and the key is speed, getting to them as soon as they are posted so you can be one of first submissions, because that matters. Everyone knows it matters a little, but we can make speed a filtering factor for companies, like if a candidate isn't using all tools available to get in front of me first, then they aren't worth it. Is there anything like this or does this change everything?"
