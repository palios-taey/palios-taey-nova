    "I would suggest reviewing my work history again and summarizing differently to frame me as a guy who has all the skills required to take AI and implement it. Like 2005 (first job at CAT Logistics) - 2024. During this time I was using data to drive decisions and automate decision making, automating and squeezing waste out of processes, sales processes, and all the other things we've discussed that prime me for this experiment and time in history to leverage AI. I honestly feel I've been waiting my whole career for this."
