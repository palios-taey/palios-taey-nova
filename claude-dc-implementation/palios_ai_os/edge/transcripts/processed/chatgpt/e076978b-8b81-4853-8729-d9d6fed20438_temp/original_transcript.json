Lots of change going on with the new administration, tough to keep track!\nUnfortunately since I last wrote, I'm still struggling to find work, it's been about 2 years. It I\u2019ve been caught up in the AI-driven job market shift and, after two years of doing everything \u201cright\u201d without landing a role, I\u2019m taking a different approach.Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m launching a LinkedIn post about my AI career transformation experiment\u2014publicly documenting the process of leveraging AI to navigate the future of work.Given your incredible network, I\u2019d truly appreciate any support you\u2019re willing to give\u2014whether that\u2019s a reshare, a quick comment, or pointing me to someone who might have insights.I\u2019ll DM you the link in LinkedIn when it\u2019s live so you can see if you're interested and have a couple options below for text if you decide to share with your network. Thanks for your time!Best,\nJesse\nOption 1\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve known Jesse LaRose for 25 years\u2014he was one of Keith Krach\u2019s mentees and has always been a sharp, forward-thinking leader.\n\nAfter two years of struggling in this rapidly changing job market, he\u2019s taking a bold step\u2014launching an AI-driven career transformation experiment and publicly documenting the journey.\n\nThis is a fascinating take on how AI is reshaping work, and I\u2019d love to see the Sigma Chi & Purdue network come together to support him.\n\nCheck it out & share if you can! \n\n\n\nOption 2\u00a0\n\nJesse LaRose has always been a big thinker. I first met him nearly 25 years ago when he was an undergrad at Purdue and one of Keith Krach\u2019s mentees. Now, he\u2019s taking on his biggest challenge yet.\n\nAfter two years of doing everything \u201cright\u201d in the job search with no results, he\u2019s flipping the script\u2014leveraging AI to rethink work itself and launching a career transformation experiment.\n\nAI is changing the job market at an unprecedented pace, and Jesse\u2019s journey is a must-follow for anyone navigating this shift.\n\nIf you\u2019re in my network and can help, please check it out and share!"
