    "So today, the superbowl is going on and my wife is big eagles fan, so wants to go out to watch that. I can not go and just have her go with her friend if needed to continue working. Monday the only thing I have is to pick up my kids from school. I would need to leave around 230-3 to get them and that takes a couple hours. I could also have my wife get them if needed. Other than that, 1 hour/day fitness ideally and chewy stuff, which I didn't do yesterday. Maybe we should get a pre-superbowl post up? Or if not and you think there's enough there and should just focus on LinkedIn and automation, I'm good with that too. "
