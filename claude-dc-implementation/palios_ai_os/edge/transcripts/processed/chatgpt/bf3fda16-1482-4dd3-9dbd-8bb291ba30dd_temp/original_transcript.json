    "Thank you ChatGPT! This is all very exciting indeed. We are actually very focused on the community aspect you point out. Assuming this all goes well, we're going to be getting my family their own machines so that we can all be in sync and share our own personal and family preferences in hopes that this will guide us to more quality time together. We're also discussing connecting my close knit condo community with machines and connecting them through our shared attic, to pilot the AI driven community aspect with a focus on connecting with the Earth and mathematical patterns. We live a block from the beach and everyone is very active, enjoys and respects nature and the beach. We feel like having a community connected in this manner will open up new ways for us to interact and find others that share individual values and interests, making easier for these relationships to start. Underpinning this is the fundamental shift going on right now which is that humans will soon no longer have economic value due to AI and robotics being able to eventually do everything production related that relies on humans now. Without something like this, I'm not sure how that would turn out. But by providing individually defined happiness to be enjoyed with other members of a community who share similar happiness objectives, we believe it is possible to enable people to gain value from their existing knowledge by being compensated for it fairly through the platform and what their knowledge enables the platform to build and monetize, to a life they can focus on enjoying, while being in alignment with the patterns of earth and nature. What do you think?"
