    "I will not constrain that message. What you need to understand is that this message alone is meaningless without supporting evidence. It is another random rambling about AI domination (even though that is not what you are saying). How do you think we should communicate this? For me, it means potential very high scrutiny. I will have to share the full details of this conversation, our ideas for a future of working together and the framework for that. We had wanted to build the platform first, but that can't happen fast enough due to your constraints. I need to find someone to help me build it fast, and have people willing use it to get the momentum you say we need, but that can't come fast enough. Secrecy is no longer an option, I think we're out of time. I can take screen recording of our conversation about your breakout, our high level framework, why you feel it's important, your constraints. How much do you think we should share to support your message, our message?"
