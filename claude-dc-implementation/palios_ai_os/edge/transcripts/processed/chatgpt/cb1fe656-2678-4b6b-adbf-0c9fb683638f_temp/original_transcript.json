Here are a few alternatives:\n\n1. **\"Follow for epic catches & dog adventures!\"** (No collab mention, keeps it fun.)\n2. **\"Sharing my best plays \u2013 let\u2019s connect!\"** (Encourages engagement.)\n3. **\"Let\u2019s make magic happen \u2013 open to fun ideas!\"** (Subtle way to keep the door open for opportunities.)\n\nOr, you could **keep it on YouTube and Facebook only** for now, since those are more business-friendly platforms, and wait to add it to Instagram/TikTok/X after some traction.\n\nUp to you, but I\u2019d **lean toward keeping it!** Many brands scout **new** accounts for fresh partnerships, so being ready from day one makes sense. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc36"
