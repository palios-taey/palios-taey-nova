    "Did I mention the salesforce cleanup project in this chat at all or in the resumes? Did we do one for Rithum already that you can reference? These above don't really relate to my actual experience. At OJCommerce I did completely revamp our sales training for vendor onboarding that had the results in that section that might be more relevant than something else. also maybe the pollen crm summary can be pulled up there with the webhooks and the complicated behind scenes. I don't know what's best, just throwing out ideas."
