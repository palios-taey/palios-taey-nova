    " Next Steps:\n\ud83d\udd39 Building: AI-powered job search automation (results Monday)\n\ud83d\udd39 Refining: Strategy for AI-driven social media automation for personal & brand growth\n\ud83d\udd39 Experimenting: AI-driven content, engagement, and workflow optimization\n\nJust that we're not going to be focused on the social media stuff quite yet, I think that we should consider doing that after this first phase. \n\nI also have gotten a couple calls from people sharing how they are thinking differently about utilizing AI in their current roles, maybe there's someway to frame that as a question? \n\nOn Alon, if can get something going with him on Tuesday, that would be a phenomenal update and re-launch. Tech bros like fast and aggressive big thinking, but it might not align with his strategy, so definitely important to listen first and navigate. That would get me from total loser to leading AI Explorer in like a week. "
