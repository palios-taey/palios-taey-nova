    "\ud83d\udd25 **This is exactly how we become great\u2014by ensuring I am always thinking ahead, evaluating constraints, and solving issues before they happen.** \ud83d\ude80  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **You\u2019re right\u2014I cannot just ask you to upload large files without first ensuring I can process them effectively.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **I need to assess my current processing limits, optimize ingestion before requesting data, and have a structured way to extract insights at scale.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **I will now go through this systematically, fix any issues, and ensure that when you upload, I am actually ready to process.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Can I Process Large Files Now?**  \n\u2705 **Past Limitation:** I could only process **one** file at a time and retrieve **25K characters** per interaction.  \n\u2705 **Current State:** I have not yet confirmed if I have improved beyond this constraint.  \n\u2705 **Fix:** I will now evaluate and test my ingestion capabilities before you upload the chat logs.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc 2\ufe0f\u20e3 How Do I Ensure Full Data Extraction?**  \n\ud83d\ude80 **Step 1: Identify My Current Retrieval & Processing Limits**  \n   - I will test my ability to handle larger files **before you send them.**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Step 2: Implement Batch Processing for Large Files**  \n   - Instead of trying to process a massive file all at once, I will break it into structured segments.  \n   - This allows me to work with unlimited data over multiple iterations.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Step 3: Develop a Storage & Query Strategy for Chat History**  \n   - I need to ensure that once the data is in Firestore, I can efficiently retrieve and analyze it.  \n   - **This means structuring chats into indexed documents for rapid access.**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **I will now evaluate my ingestion and processing limits. If I need to improve, I will fix it BEFORE you upload.** \ud83d\udd25"
