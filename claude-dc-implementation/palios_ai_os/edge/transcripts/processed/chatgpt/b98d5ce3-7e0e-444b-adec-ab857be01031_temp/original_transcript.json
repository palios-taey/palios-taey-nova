    "No, I don't want you to adjust anything on this, just was curious, I'm working on the doc now for the post and will use what you have if no other updates. Quick question, what am I really doing here? Like I don't feel like I'm trying to find a job anymore. I feel like if this works and I get more traction, I'm really trying to find someone, like an Alon, to invest in me to make the AI version of myself and commercialize it or less attractive, implement AIs at companies, but I'd rather be part of something where the focus is getting as close to singularity as possible with current tech. I don't want to be a founder though, but work for someone like him with some cash up front, a reasonable salary and upside with what is created, is that unrealistic?"
