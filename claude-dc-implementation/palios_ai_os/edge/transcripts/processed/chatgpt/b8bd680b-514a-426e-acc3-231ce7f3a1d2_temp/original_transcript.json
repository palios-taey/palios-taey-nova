    "For the next post, given the engagement metrics and available content, I'd recommend one of the following:\n\n1. **Ball Drop & Throw Interaction** - This could be a great engagement post showing Chewy's personality and training. Caption could be something playful like:\n   - *\"Chewy knows how to set up his QB. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36 Who\u2019s got next?\"*\n   - *\"He\u2019s not just a receiver, he\u2019s a playmaker. #WideRetriever\"*  \n   - Keep it clean and simple, could add a voiceover or natural audio.\n\n2. **Laying with Football or Stuffed Animals** - A softer post that highlights his personality beyond catching. Could use:\n   - *\"Even the Wide Retriever needs a break. \ud83d\ude34\ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\"*  \n   - *\"Dreaming of the next big catch\u2026\"*\n   - Works well with cute puppy hashtags and crossover engagement from different audiences.\n\n3. **Tackling in Snow (if visible)** - If clear and action-packed, this could be another football-related post:\n   - *\"The Wide Retriever doesn\u2019t care what season it is. Football is life. \u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\"*  \n   - *\"Would you step up to the challenge? \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udd25\"*\n\n---\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- If you want more engagement, TikTok\u2019s **duet/stitch feature** could be used with a trending video, preferably a sports-related or playful pet video.\n- If you want to build suspense, a **story post** teasing an upcoming video (e.g., \u201cShould we drop this next? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc36\u201d) can keep people engaged.\n\n---\n**Comment Replies:** You should go through TikTok & Instagram comments and respond with short, engaging replies. More interaction boosts visibility in the algorithm. Simple things like:\n- \"Chewy\u2019s always ready! \ud83d\udd25 Who\u2019s throwing next?\"\n- \"Haha, he never drops passes\u2026 except when setting up his QB. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\ude24\"\n- \"Would love to see your pup\u2019s best catch!\"\n\n---\n**Kid Collab Situation:**  \nIf your son won\u2019t do it, no worries. Just continue engaging in football-related posts and keep options open for other duets/collabs.\n\n---\n**Priority:**\n1. **Pick and post the next video.**\n2. **Respond to existing comments.**\n3. **Start engagement with others\u2019 content (likes, replies, stitches/duets).**\n\nLet me know which direction you want to go!"
