    "### **Thoughts on Your Two Points:**\n\n#### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Follow/Unfollow Growth Strategy & Automation**\nYou're **absolutely right** that this was a major growth hack in the mid-2010s. It **still works** today but has **risks** due to tighter platform rules. Here\u2019s a **breakdown**:  \n\n\u2705 **Why It\u2019s Still Effective:**  \n- Helps **kickstart early growth** and get more profile visibility.  \n- Follows from **targeted audiences** (e.g., AI influencers, football dog accounts) have **higher engagement potential** than random followers.  \n- Can **scale quickly with automation.**  \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Why It\u2019s Risky & Needs AI/Tooling:**  \n- **Platforms crack down** on aggressive follow/unfollow.  \n- Limits exist (e.g., ~400/day on X, ~150/day on Instagram, ~50/day on LinkedIn).  \n- **Needs smart filtering** so we **don\u2019t follow bots** or **risk account flags.**  \n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 My Recommendation:**  \n\u2705 **Test this on X & Insta** with an **AI-based tool** that:  \n- **Identifies high-value accounts** to follow.  \n- **Unfollows only if no engagement happens** after 3-5 days.  \n- **Mimics natural behavior** (not robotic).  \n\nI\u2019d suggest looking into **PhantomBuster** or **TweetPilot** for X, **Nitreo** for Insta, and possibly **LinkedHelper** for LinkedIn.  \n\n---\n#### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Abacus.AI - Worth It?**\n\ud83d\udd25 **Abacus.AI is very interesting.** It\u2019s an **end-to-end AI model deployment & automation platform** with potential **enterprise applications** for AI workflow automation.  \n\n\u2705 **Why It\u2019s Worth Exploring:**  \n- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** \u2192 Could be useful for AI-powered job search automation.  \n- **Custom AI models & fine-tuning** \u2192 Might be a next-level play if we go deeper into AI automation.  \n- **Real-time AI for business processes** \u2192 **Could be a differentiator** if you get into AI consulting.  \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **But\u2026 Here\u2019s My Concern:**  \n- It\u2019s **focused on enterprise-level AI solutions**, not personal branding or social media automation.  \n- **Cost & complexity** \u2192 Do you want to spend time learning a deep tech AI platform right now?  \n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 My Recommendation:**  \n\u2705 **Keep an eye on it but don\u2019t dive in yet.**  \n\u2705 If we start **building AI automation workflows**, this could be **a tool to integrate later.**  \n\n---\n### **Next Steps (Back to Execution)**\nNow that we have these on the radar, let\u2019s **jump back into the X profile setup and automation tasks.**  \n\n**Starting with:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Finalizing the \"About\" & \"Work History\" on X.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Drafting the first pinned post.**  \n\nReady to move forward? \ud83d\ude80"
