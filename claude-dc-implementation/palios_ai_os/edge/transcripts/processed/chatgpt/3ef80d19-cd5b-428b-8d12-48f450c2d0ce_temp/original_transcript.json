    "For **Facebook**, since it requires a first and last name, you have a few options:\n\n### Best Options for Branding & Authenticity:\n1. **First Name:** *Wide*  \n   **Last Name:** *Retriever Chewy*  \n   _(Keeps it aligned with the brand while feeling somewhat natural.)_\n\n2. **First Name:** *Chewy*  \n   **Last Name:** *The Wide Retriever*  \n   _(Feels personal and still sticks to branding.)_\n\n3. **First Name:** *WideRetriever*  \n   **Last Name:** *Chewy*  \n   _(Directly matches other handles but may look less like a real name.)_\n\n4. **First Name:** *Wide*  \n   **Last Name:** *Retriever*  \n   _(Simple and clean, though it omits Chewy's name.)_\n\n**Alternative (If Needed for Verification Issues):**  \n- Create the account under your name, then create a **Facebook Page** for Wide Retriever Chewy. This ensures longevity and avoids any potential account restrictions.\n\nLet me know which approach you prefer, and we\u2019ll move forward! \ud83d\ude80"
