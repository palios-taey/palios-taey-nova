    "### **\ud83d\ude80 Smart Move \u2013 Hold Off Until Tuesday with Alon**  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Why This Works:**  \n- You don\u2019t need **full** RAG **yet**, just a **basic memory system** to start.  \n- Talking to Alon **first** means you can evaluate whether his solution is a good fit or if we build from scratch.  \n- **If his RAG system is solid,** you could potentially **shortcut months of development** with an existing tool.  \n\n### **\ud83d\udccc What to Do Before Tuesday**\n\u2705 **Get clarity on what his RAG system actually does** (Does it handle structured knowledge retention? Decision history? Context-aware responses?)  \n\u2705 **Draft key questions for Alon** (so you can maximize the convo \u2013 I can help with this)  \n\u2705 **Meanwhile, start Phase 1 Lite RAG** (simple storage & retrieval so you have some system running **now**)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **If Alon\u2019s RAG can help, great \u2013 if not, we build our own.**  \nEither way, you\u2019re moving forward without waiting. **Let\u2019s go.** \ud83d\ude80"
