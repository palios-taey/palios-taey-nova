    "You currently have the wrong remote origin set, causing the error:\n\n```\nERROR: Repository not found.\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n```\n\nThis means your remote URL is not correctly configured.\n\n### \u2705 How to fix it:\n\n1. **Check your current remote:**\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\n2. **Correct the remote URL if necessary:**\nReplace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-github-username>/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\nIf the above doesn't work (or if you're using HTTPS), use:\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\n3. **Then push again:**\n```bash\ngit push origin main --force\n```\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Note:\n- Make sure the repository exists on GitHub under your account.\n- Using `--force` is safe only because you've intentionally cleaned the repo history from secrets. Make sure everything local is correct and clean before forcing.\n\nDo this carefully, and you'll be good!"
