    "Ok, so it looks like you combined some things that weren't in there with what was in the Knowledge Vault, which isn't necessarily bad. We also didn't follow the process, you were supposed to let me know the table and I would send the screen shots for you. The screenshots are here and this is what you previously recommended. Please look over the reasoning in the chat for your previous recommendations and evaluate the table you just submitted to return the table that makes the most sense to you for this overall project. The column 'Select' I missed inputting the name you gave, looks like action required or something based on options in screen shot. Please return completed table with your recommendations.\n\n"
