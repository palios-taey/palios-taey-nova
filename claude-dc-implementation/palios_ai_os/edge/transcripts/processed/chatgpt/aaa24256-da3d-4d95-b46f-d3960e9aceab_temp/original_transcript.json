    "Also don't like that it says I prepared for next professional chapter, because it's been more than a year since that career break ended. What is the best way for me to position the time without a job? Obviously I didn't intend to still be out of work when I did the initial career break entry. Basically, I lost my job, did the condo for 8 months (i made it longer until october for some reason, the work was still ongoing, started looking for a job in August, coldnt get anything, hired a complete waste of time company to assist, did that through february, kept looking, had the pollen thing come up, did that for a few months, they couldn't raise money, after looking again for a month and not getting a couple lower level jobs I interviewed for, I did the data analysis training. Now I'm here.\n\nThat is what actually happened for the most part. I also have DSG (drop ship guy) e-commerce consulting, listed on my linkedin from nov 2023 - present. I started that LLC and company because a recruiter told me that this was my best option. I didn't really ever market myself this way.\n\nSo how should I, if at all, or what parts of this should I communicate and how should I structure?"
