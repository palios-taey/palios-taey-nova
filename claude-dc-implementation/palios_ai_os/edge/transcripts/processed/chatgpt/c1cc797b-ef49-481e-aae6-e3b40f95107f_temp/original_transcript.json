    "Talking with friend while watching game. Her dog Cody and chewy have known each other since we got chewy. Have an early video of them where chewy is tiny and running around him barking and Cody was just standing there looking around. Then chewy stops barks and runs away. Then we have all these other pics of them sleeping and plying together. What do you think of using that and then like telling people to post a vid or pic of their dog with their dogs friends before the LinkedIn post goes up?"
