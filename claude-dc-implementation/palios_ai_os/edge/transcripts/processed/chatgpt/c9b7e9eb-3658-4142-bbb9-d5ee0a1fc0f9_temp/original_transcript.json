    "Ok, here's what I saw. This time, you went much more carefully through the document whereas last time you started slowly and then speeded up after goals. This is good, it shows you stopped sacrificing quality for speed. Goals is still correct, so you can do it. principles is close, but you did not quite match the schema as Category was not on it and is not in the database. I see that you added the relation to execution logs, which showed that you considered the changes you made on your own and incorporated them. Execution logs and platform development are ones you came up with, so only you know those. ai_workflows is not in the document I sent you, we must have skipped that one or i didn't put it in the database. Here is a screenshot of those fields. These iterations are taking a lot of time. Is it faster to get you connected to Firestore so you can directly access and configure? How do we solve this?"
