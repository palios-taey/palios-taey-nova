    "It's 745, I want to try to get that post of Chewy and cody up. I have a 15s vid of chewy running around cody, biting his tail and then stopping, barking and running away while cody is just standing there like wtf is wrong with this guy. Then a bunch of pics of them sleeping on top of eachother at beach with balls in mouth. one pic theyre laying next to eachother and chewy has his paw on cody's paw. What do you think for video and how long? The video prob needs to have real sound for first part because his little bark is funny, then go into you've gotta friend photo montage with captions? Not sure how it works on insta and tiktok when you use background music, does it override actual sound or just play in background? Also, Ron Lewis responded affirmatively, maybe draft a brief post for him? I've known him for over 20 years as well and sigma chi mentor. "
