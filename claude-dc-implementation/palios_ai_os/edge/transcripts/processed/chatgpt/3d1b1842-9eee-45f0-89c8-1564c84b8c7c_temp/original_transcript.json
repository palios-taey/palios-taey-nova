    "Ok, let's get the sample data together. Please use actual data from this chat wherever possible and submit fully complete data tables as you would if you were actually populating these tables. That includes all fields, you should have access to everything and can just use 2/15/2025 for dates. As we're going through the data and I'm loading it, I'll review the Db Definitions and we can update/clarify as needed. Does this make sense?"
