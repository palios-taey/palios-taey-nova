    "Ok, let's do X post. I think what you have makes sense. I would def include Chewy vid and attach the Y combinator sheet in whatever post in thread is relevant. Maybe the first/main post with the hook has chewy and it's like what you have up above, but with your response and then attach chewy vid and go into rest. If you agree most effective, if not, whatever you think."
