    "This is a **great** video to show Chewy\u2019s personality and how he engages with people. It gives more context to his behavior, making him feel more like a local legend rather than just a dog who catches footballs. Since the second throw is short, the video is more about his **charisma and social tendencies** rather than athleticism.\n\n### **Post Strategy & Caption Options:**\nBecause this one is more **personality-driven**, I\u2019d suggest a **fun, lighthearted caption** instead of a football-dominant one.\n\n#### **Option 1 (Personality Focused)**\n*\"Chewy\u2019s got options\u2014he\u2019s scouting for a new QB1. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36 Who\u2019s stepping up?\"*  \n\n#### **Option 2 (Engagement-Based)**\n*\"Elite hands? \u2705 Social skills? \u2705 Now he just needs a QB who can actually sling it. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\"*  \n\n#### **Option 3 (Humorous)**\n*\"Chewy keeps drafting new QBs, but they just keep checking it down. Somebody stretch the field! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **Hashtags:**\n#WideRetriever #DogsOfInstagram #FootballDogs #Mossed #NFLDogs #SportsTikTok #DogsOfTikTok #DogsOfIG #QBScouting #DraftChewy  \n\n---\n\n### **Posting Details:**  \n- **Platforms:** **TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts**  \n- **Audio:** Can stay natural since there\u2019s interaction, OR we could add a **funny, light instrumental track** to enhance the vibe  \n- **Length:** Since the first video is 19s and second is 10s, we may want to **trim a bit** from the first to keep engagement high  \n- **Engagement Boost:** We\u2019ll follow up with comments and interactions after posting  \n\n---\n\nLet me know which **caption** you prefer, or if you want me to tweak anything further before posting!"
