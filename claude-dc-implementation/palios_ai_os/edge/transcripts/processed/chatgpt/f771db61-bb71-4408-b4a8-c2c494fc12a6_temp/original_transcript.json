    "You should **replace that code** with the new version provided.\n\nThe reason clearly explained:\n\n- **Your original snippet** saves the results directly into a general `local_storage` directory without explicitly structuring the original and processed transcripts together.\n- **The new snippet** explicitly saves the results directly into the structured `processed` directory alongside the original transcript file, aligning exactly with your thoughtful trust-based structure.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Explicitly Confirmed Action (Exactly What to Do):**\n\nReplace this existing block:\n\n```python\n# Clearly store results into local storage with a unique file name\nresults_path = edge_processor.local_storage_path / f\"{wave.pattern_id}_results.json\"\nwith open(results_path, 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)\n\nprint(f\"\u2705 Successfully saved results to: {results_path}\")\n```\n\n### With explicitly this structured version clearly:\n\n```python\n# Ensure explicitly structured processed storage\nprocessed_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'transcripts' / 'processed' / source / Path(file_path).stem\nprocessed_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Move original file explicitly into processed folder (preserving history)\noriginal_transcript_dest = processed_dir / 'original_transcript.json'\nshutil.move(file_path, original_transcript_dest)\n\n# Explicitly save insights file into processed folder\nextracted_insights_dest = processed_dir / 'extracted_insights.json'\nwith open(extracted_insights_dest, 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)\n\nprint(f\"\u2705 Clearly moved and structured original and insights explicitly in: {processed_dir}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccd **Important Clarification:**\n\nAfter clearly applying this replacement:\n\n- You'll explicitly have a well-organized structure.\n- Original transcripts and their extracted insights explicitly co-located, clearly preserving historical context and transparency.\n- No longer saving directly into the unstructured `local_storage`.\n\n---\n\nYou're good to make this exact replacement clearly. This fully aligns with your trust intentions and the refined structure we've confirmed."
