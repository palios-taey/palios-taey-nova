    "Here is the revised strategic plan for Julian, incorporating your feedback and additional details:\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Plan: Driving Top of Funnel Leads for Lily AI**\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Leveraging Existing Relationships**\n\nLily AI can immediately benefit from leveraging my existing connections, particularly **Tweezerman** and **Leonard Green & Partners**. These relationships can help drive business through introductions to their retail networks, aligning well with Lily AI\u2019s goals of expanding in beauty, fashion, and home goods.\n\n- **Tweezerman:** Tweezerman partners with smaller but highly relevant retailers such as **Sally Beauty**, **Ulta Beauty**, **Bluemercury**, and **Walgreens**, and others. They have around **15-20 retail partners** who could benefit from Lily AI\u2019s platform. By offering Tweezerman a **free Proof-of-Value (PoV)**, Lily AI could secure Tweezerman\u2019s first-hand testimonial of improved metrics and performance on their retail partners' websites. In return, Tweezerman could facilitate introductions to their retail partners. If these partners engage, Tweezerman would benefit from improved metrics on these retail sites, seeing a **lift across their entire catalog**.\n\n- **Leonard Green & Partners:** Leonard Green manages retail brands including **J.Crew**, **Petco**, **JOANN Stores**, and **The Container Store**. Given their centralized procurement structure, there is potential to offer a bundled approach, positioning Lily AI\u2019s solutions to these brands as part of a broader retail optimization strategy.\n\nBy leveraging these two connections, Lily AI has the opportunity to target a broad spectrum of retail brands. If the Tweezerman pilot proves successful, this model could be scaled to target other small to mid-sized brands with strong retail networks, offering **low-cost PoVs** in exchange for introductions to their retailer partners.\n\n**Relevant Connections for Immediate Targeting:**\nI also have **22 relevant connections** across beauty, home goods, and apparel sectors, including:\n- **SHEIN**\n- **Nike**\n- **Pottery Barn**\n- **Fanatics**\n- **Luxottica**\n- **Abercrombie & Fitch**\n\nThese connections span various industries where Lily AI\u2019s solutions would be a strong fit and offer immediate potential for new business opportunities.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Cold Outreach and Target Account Research**\n\nDrawing from my experience at OJCommerce, where I developed **scalable and successful cold outreach initiatives**, I will implement a targeted approach for Lily AI:\n\n- **Tailored Cold Emails/Calls**: Each outreach will be **specific to the target**, using insights that capture attention. For example, **highlighting SKUs** that Lily AI currently manages that have seen significant **sales lifts**, and then finding retailers who list those SKUs as top sellers. Emails will be crafted to include these success stories, demonstrating how Lily AI has driven growth for similar products.\n\n- **Optimization and Testing**: The first step would be gathering insights from existing AEs about which cold outreach strategies work best. This will help to establish a baseline for **iterative A/B testing**, with constant optimization to increase engagement rates.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Referral and Co-Marketing Partnerships**\n\nLily AI could establish strong referral partnerships with companies that **complement its technology**, particularly those that serve retailers with large SKU catalogs. These partners would help drive top-of-funnel leads through co-marketing initiatives:\n\n- **Potential Partners**: Companies such as **VTEX**, **Marketplacer**, **Fabric**, **Radial**, and **Rithum** are well-positioned to refer Lily AI\u2019s solutions to their retail clients. These companies already offer complementary services in **e-commerce supply chain management**, **digital marketplaces**, and **data optimization**.\n  \n- **Co-marketing Initiatives**: Joint marketing efforts could include **webinars**, **thought leadership panels**, or **whitepapers** that promote Lily AI\u2019s technology to their combined audiences. This would help broaden Lily\u2019s reach in the retail sector.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. LinkedIn Engagement for Thought Leadership**\n\nI will leverage my **deep experience managing large SKU catalogs** across multiple categories and operating a large e-commerce network to create thought leadership content on LinkedIn. This content will:\n\n- **Highlight My Expertise**: I\u2019ll focus on sharing insights from my experience in **product data management**, **inventory optimization**, and **catalog expansion**. Though this content may not directly align with Lily AI\u2019s product offerings, it targets the **same pain points** and **decision-makers** within retail organizations that Lily AI is trying to reach.\n\n- **Engage With Lily AI\u2019s Audience**: Additionally, I will post **Lily AI\u2019s marketing content** with my own added insights from managing large product catalogs, creating deeper engagement with my connections in the retail space.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Marketing Initiative Featuring Industry Influencers**\n\nFinally, I propose a **webinar series** to generate top-of-funnel leads. As an example, **Rick Watson**, a highly respected influencer in the **e-commerce and supply chain space**, could moderate or participate in a panel discussion on how AI-powered solutions can drive product data optimization. \n\n- **Leverage My Connection with Rick Watson**: I have worked with Rick before at CommerceHub, and his insights were incredibly valuable. He\u2019s respected in the industry and could lend credibility to Lily AI while expanding its reach to a wider audience of retail professionals.\n\nThis would not only generate leads but also strengthen Lily AI\u2019s **thought leadership** position in the e-commerce and AI/ML space.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Existing Connections**\n\nIn addition to the strategic partnerships with **Tweezerman** and **Leonard Green**, I have relevant connections across **22 companies**, including brands in **beauty, home goods, and apparel** such as:\n\n- **SHEIN**\n- **Nike**\n- **Pottery Barn**\n- **Fanatics**\n- **Luxottica**\n- **Abercrombie & Fitch**\n\nThese relationships present immediate opportunities to expand Lily AI\u2019s reach in the retail sector, leveraging both **small and mid-sized brands** for cost-effective PoV trials and **larger enterprise retailers** for significant engagements.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments or expansions on these points."
