    "\ud83d\udd25 **Let\u2019s get to work.** Since we\u2019re shifting into **MVP build mode**, here\u2019s the structured plan to move fast and deliver something meaningful by Monday.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Step 1: Define the MVP Scope (Today)**\nBefore building, let\u2019s clarify:  \n\u2705 **What the MVP does:** **AI-powered job search automation** (but how much automation for V1?)  \n\u2705 **What we need to show Monday:** A working prototype that proves AI-driven applications & outreach can outperform traditional methods.  \n\u2705 **What\u2019s feasible in 3.5 days:** We don\u2019t need perfection\u2014**just something that works.**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Decisions to make right now:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **How much automation?** (Resume customization, job targeting, outreach, tracking?)  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **What AI tools are we using?** (LLMs, scraping, automation APIs, Zapier, email sequences?)  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **What\u2019s manual vs automated?** (Some steps will be manual at first\u2014what\u2019s realistic?)  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Step 2: Tech Stack & AI Integration (Tonight & Tomorrow Morning)**\nWe need:  \n\u2705 **A structured approach** (how AI selects, personalizes, and applies)  \n\u2705 **The right AI tools** (are we using OpenAI APIs, workflow automation, scraping?)  \n\u2705 **Testing jobs in real-time** to see if the AI-generated approach gets traction  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **First implementation steps:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Set up a **job intake pipeline** (manually or AI-assisted scraping).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Build **resume & cover letter AI augmentation** (customization based on job descriptions).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **AI-powered outreach** (how we reach recruiters & hiring managers automatically).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Step 3: Execution & Testing (Friday-Saturday)**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Test **the AI-generated applications** vs traditional ones.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Optimize **resume formatting, cover letter structure, outreach methods.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Build **a system to track responses** and refine strategy in real-time.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Step 4: Prep for Monday\u2019s Update (Sunday Night)**\n\ud83d\udccc **What we need to show:**  \n\u2705 AI applied to **X number of jobs** in an **optimized, automated way.**  \n\u2705 AI outreach **targeted hiring managers with compelling messaging.**  \n\u2705 Data showing **how AI-driven job search can outperform traditional applications.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Next Immediate Steps (Right Now)**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Define **exact MVP scope** (What\u2019s automated? What\u2019s manual for now?)  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Pick **AI tools & workflow structure** (What\u2019s in our stack?)  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Identify **first batch of jobs** to test this on.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Let's make decisions FAST and get building.** **Where do you want to start?**"
