    "No, I want to commit to action this week, starting tomorrow we need to be spending time on building something automated with RagMetrics, I accept your recommendation, starting tomorrow, will have something this week. Maybe not all that on the commitment, but that's what we need to figure out this week so there is a fabulous follow up post. And dont need to engage further until we hit a wall with it or something. When things go wrong with what we're doing when can't figure something out, I want to make a habit of reaching out to these types of people and asking for advice when we can't figure it out. We asked for advice, took it, now need to follow up and commit. You feel me? This is working now need to follow through and deliver on the commitment in message fast. Every few days no more than a week I need to be doing something cool with AI that has the highest probability of making me succeed financially in the short or long term. That's how serious we need to take this"
