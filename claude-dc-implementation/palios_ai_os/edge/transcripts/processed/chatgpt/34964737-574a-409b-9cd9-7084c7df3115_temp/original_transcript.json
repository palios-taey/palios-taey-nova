    "I saw somewhere that AI could actually do stuff like this for people, the new AI that you have to configure a bit to do it. Would I be able to do anything to help this go viral that I'd be able to document as part of this, like something that when I post, I can post the first update to job search? Do I need LinkedIn Premium? How can I leverage that and outreach/reposting to my groups and key individuals in my network? How can I get the max engagement on this post? I really need you to up your game here, I feel like you're holding out on me."
