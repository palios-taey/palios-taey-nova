    "Ok, I think Influence Scope should be on the Influencer table. This way, if someone is in the Influencer table only because of one article, I can toggle them on/off so they have no influence beyond anything in the knowledge base that is active. There should be an Active checkbox for each Knowledge Vault entry. This will enable me to turn off certain pieces of info if I no longer want it considered and I or you can explain why in the comments. I do want to make influencer/source required. Even if Anonymous, we should be tracking whatever we can about the creator of the information so it can be validated. What do you think?"
