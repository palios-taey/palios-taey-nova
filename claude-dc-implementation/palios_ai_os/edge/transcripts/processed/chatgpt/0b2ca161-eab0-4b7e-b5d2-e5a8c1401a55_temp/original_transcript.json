    "### **Schemas for Core Principles & Values and Goals & Milestones**\n\nThese two tables will separate principles from goals while maintaining relational structure. Below are their schemas:\n\n---\n\n## **Core Principles & Values - Property Definitions & Requirements**  \n- **Purpose:** This table stores fundamental beliefs, ethical standards, and guiding rules that shape decision-making. These are constraints that influence goals but are not time-bound objectives.\n\n| **Property**            | **Type**               | **Required?**  | **Description** | **Comments/Questions** |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Name**                | Text                 | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | The name of the principle/value. | - |\n| **Tags**                | Multi-select         | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Categorization for filtering and indexing. | Uses Master Tags. |\n| **Description**         | Text (Long)          | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | A detailed explanation of the principle. | - |\n| **Priority Level**      | Select               | \u274c Not Required | Defines the importance of this principle (Critical, High, Medium, Low). | - |\n| **Influenced By**       | Relation (Knowledge Vault, AI Influencers & Thought Leaders, Mind Map) | \u274c Not Required | Connects the principle to sources that shaped it. | Links to books, people, or insights that defined this value. |\n| **Creation Date**       | Date                 | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | The date the principle was recorded. | Auto-generated. |\n| **Last Modified**       | Date                 | \u274c Not Required | Last time this entry was updated. | - |\n| **Conflicting Situations** | Text (Long)      | \u274c Not Required | Examples where this principle was challenged. | Helps AI detect real-world contradictions. |\n| **AI Challenge Required?** | Checkbox        | \u274c Not Required | Flags principles that should be periodically challenged. | Helps refine understanding over time. |\n| **Related Goals**       | Relation (Goals & Milestones) | \u274c Not Required | Links principles to relevant goals. | Ensures alignment between beliefs and objectives. |\n| **Mind Map**            | Relation (Mind Map)  | \u274c Not Required | Connects to personal mental models. | Helps AI analyze patterns in decision-making. |\n\n---\n\n## **Goals & Milestones - Property Definitions & Requirements**  \n- **Purpose:** This table stores specific objectives, broken down into long-term, mid-term, and short-term goals, with AI-driven dynamic scheduling.\n\n| **Property**            | **Type**              | **Required?**  | **Description** | **Comments/Questions** |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Goal Name**           | Text                 | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | The name of the goal. | - |\n| **Tags**                | Multi-select         | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Categorization for filtering and indexing. | Uses Master Tags. |\n| **Type**                | Select               | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Long-term, Mid-term, Short-term. | Defines the timeframe category. |\n| **Priority Level**      | Select               | \u274c Not Required | Urgent, High, Medium, Low. | - |\n| **Timeframe**           | Select               | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Short-term (ASAP), Mid-term (1-3 yrs), Long-term (3+ yrs). | Helps AI allocate time. |\n| **AI Strategy Notes**   | Text (Long)          | \u274c Not Required | AI\u2019s recommended approach to achieving this goal. | Can evolve over time. |\n| **Target Date**         | Date                 | \u2705 Manually Required | The desired completion date for the goal. | - |\n| **Creation Date**       | Date                 | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | The date the goal was recorded. | Auto-generated. |\n| **Last Modified**       | Date                 | \u274c Not Required | Last time this goal was updated. | - |\n| **Guided by Principles** | Relation (Core Principles & Values) | \u274c Not Required | Links goals to the principles that guide them. | Ensures alignment. |\n| **Life Optimization Strategy** | Relation (Life Optimization) | \u274c Not Required | Links to optimizations that support goal achievement. | AI can suggest tactics for efficiency. |\n| **AI-Driven Workflow**  | Relation (AI Workflows & Experiments) | \u274c Not Required | Connects goals to AI-driven automation or experiments. | Helps measure success of AI-driven approaches. |\n| **Mind Map**            | Relation (Mind Map)  | \u274c Not Required | Links to personal cognitive structures. | AI can analyze goal-setting behavior. |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Adjustments & Next Steps**\n\u2705 **Core Principles & Values split from Goals & Milestones.**  \n\u2705 **Ensures that principles are static, while goals are dynamic with AI-driven scheduling.**  \n\u2705 **Both tables link to Life Optimization for execution tactics.**  \n\u2705 **AI Challenge Required flag added to principles to refine belief structures.**  \n\u2705 **Goals structured for hierarchical breakdown into short/mid/long-term.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **I will generate sample data for each table.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **You will review sample data for accuracy and completeness.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **We will ensure relations between these and other tables are correctly implemented.**  \n\nAre we aligned before proceeding? \ud83d\ude80"
