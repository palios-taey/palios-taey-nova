    "Ok, I need a plan to resume my job search. You should have an understanding for skill sets and analytics training, roles/companies that I should be targeting. I haven't reached out to my LinkedIn network in a while and I also do not ever post on LinkedIn. I can get LinkedIn Premium if required and do other relevant value added services that aren't too expensive. Can you develop a perfect plan for me to find a job as fast as possible? Also for consideration is the LinkedIn plea post. Open to anything, so just give me the best plan that I can execute in 6 hours/day. I'd like it to be very detailed with what I should be doing, how, how much time it should take and the order in which things should be done. "
