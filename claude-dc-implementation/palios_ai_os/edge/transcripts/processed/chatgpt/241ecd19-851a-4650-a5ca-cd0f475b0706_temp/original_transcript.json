    "Here's the issue that's causing the current error, along with a recommended fix:\n\n## Current Issue:\nThe error you're encountering when running the MCP server:\n\n```\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 251 column 34 (char 7946)\n```\n\nis due to a syntax error in your `conductor_config.json` file.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix:\n### Step-by-Step Resolution:\n\n**Step 1:**\nOpen the file `conductor_config.json` and go to line 251. You'll see this segment causing the issue:\n\nCurrent problematic line (line 251):\n```json\n\"structure\": \"24 preludes and fugues in all major and minor keys\"\n```\n\nThis line needs a trailing comma to be properly formatted in JSON. Correct it to:\n\n```json\n\"structure\": \"24 preludes and fugues in all major and minor keys\",\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\nSave the corrected file `conductor_config.json`.\n\n**Step 3:**\nRun the MCP server again:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m uvicorn src.mcp.mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n```\n\n---\n\n## Why the Issue Occurred:\nJSON requires key-value pairs to be separated by commas. Missing commas create syntax errors, causing JSON decoding to fail.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Recommendations:\n- **Validation:**  \n  Always validate JSON configurations before running scripts. You can use a simple online JSON validator or IDE extensions to detect such issues early.\n\n- **Version Control:**  \n  After fixing, commit and push your changes to GitHub to ensure synchronization across all your environments.\n\n---\n\n## Required Updates to the Environment:\n- Ensure `aiohttp` is added to your `requirements.txt` since you manually installed it:\n  \n```\naiohttp\n```\n\n- Verify your corrected and finalized dependencies match your environment:\n```\nfastapi\nuvicorn\npydantic\nrequests\naiohttp\nanthropic\nopenai\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform\nnumpy\npython-dotenv\nspacy\nstreamlit\n```\n\nAdd these explicitly to `requirements.txt` if they are not already listed, then reinstall:\n\n```bash\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nOnce you've corrected the JSON syntax and updated your dependencies, try running the server again. This should resolve your immediate error.\n\nLet me know if further assistance is required!"
