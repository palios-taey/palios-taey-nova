    "You're getting strong engagement in the comments, but if reposts aren't picking up as expected, we need to take some proactive steps. Here\u2019s how to push for more:  \n\n### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Follow Up with Your High-Value Contacts**  \n- DM the ones who already supported/liked the post but haven\u2019t reshared.  \n- Quick message:  \n  _\"Hey [Name], really appreciate you engaging with the post! If you think it\u2019s worth sharing, a quick repost could really help get this in front of the right people. Thanks again for the support!\"_  \n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Repost the Post Yourself with a New Angle**  \n- Add fresh commentary and tag a few relevant people. Example:  \n  _\"The response to this post has been amazing so far\u2014thank you to everyone who's engaged! One thing that keeps coming up in the comments: AI is changing the job market faster than anyone expected. What\u2019s your take?_\"_  \n- Link the original post in the comments.  \n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Ask Your Wife & Close Contacts for a Strong Repost**  \n- Make it easy by drafting something they can tweak:  \n  _\"What Jesse is doing here is something more people should be thinking about. AI is changing everything\u2014if you haven\u2019t seen this yet, check it out and share your thoughts.\"_  \n\n### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Post in New Groups or Threads**  \n- Since you already hit Purdue/Sigma Chi groups, think about other communities\u2014AI-focused ones, job search groups, or entrepreneur networks.  \n- If allowed, make a **new post** instead of just a comment, using a fresh hook:  \n  _\"I just launched an AI-driven job search experiment\u2014if you\u2019ve been laid off or are thinking about AI\u2019s impact on work, this is for you.\"_  \n\n### **5\ufe0f\u20e3 Leverage X (Twitter) & Drive Cross-Platform Traffic**  \n- Tweet out a new hook and say, **\"Full post on LinkedIn here\"** with the link.  \n- You might get people from Twitter resharing on LinkedIn if they come across it.  \n\n**Goal:** Get at least 20+ reposts by the end of the day. Let\u2019s get after it! \ud83d\ude80"
