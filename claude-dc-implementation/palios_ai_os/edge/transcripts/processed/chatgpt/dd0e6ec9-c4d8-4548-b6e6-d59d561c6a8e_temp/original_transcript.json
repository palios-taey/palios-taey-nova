    "So let's talk through the LinkedIn post strategy. What we agreed that needed to be communicated, which isn't in the document because it got lost when I exceeded the chat length, was a very nice post that had the big idea, that we've come up with a way to redefine work and the job search process, and we're going to try it out. It said that traditionally candidates have been evaluated based on their experience, skills and education and now we are adding ability to leverage all that to implement AI. We thought it would be good to see if hiring managers or companies had jobs they wanted to submit, or if people wanted to submit their current job descriptions. If not, we'll find one. This will be the experiment that we'll build something for by Monday. The other part was a quick update on the post metrics, thank you to everyone and decision on chewy with explanation. What we need to determine now is what to do about the update posts. I don't think I want to bother Daniela, but I will tomorrow if needed. "
