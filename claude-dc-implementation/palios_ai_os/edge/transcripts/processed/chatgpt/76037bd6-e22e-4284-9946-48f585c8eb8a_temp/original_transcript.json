    "Comments below, please review and respond with final updates. You can consider feedback below and decide what's best affirmatively.\n\nAdd: A column for \"Used In\" (Relation)  - I don't understand this. Which table should it relate to?\nI think parent-child heirarchy can be added later as needed. It shouldn't be too difficult for you to accurately move the children under the correct Parent if we decide that's the structure we need right?\n\nNext action should probably be structured. Won't this mainly be automated? Is this more of a flag for manual review?\nInfluencer/Source is one-way related to AI Influence(rs) (just updated that title in the table to be correct)\nRelevance to Jesse Added - this and all priorities have Urgent, High, Medium, Low\n\n\n\nRelevance Area\u201d (Multi-select) \u2192 So we know if we follow them for Business, Health, AI, etc. - this is handled by Tags column\nDeep Research Available check box added\n\n\"Results Notes\" Added, good catch. One way relation to PKD called \"PKD\" added\n\nPriority Level is in there, would you like it renamed? Aligned Life Area is 2-way with Life Optimization\n\nReview Needed checkbox added. Contradictory AI Response - What type of field is this?\n\nSteps & Process is a text field. I can add \"Next Step\" to single out the immediate next action though?\n\n\n\n"
