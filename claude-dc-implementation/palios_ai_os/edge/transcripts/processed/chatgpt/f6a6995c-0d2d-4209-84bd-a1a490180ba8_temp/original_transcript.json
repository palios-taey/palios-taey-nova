    "The rate limit error you're encountering is specifically due to **exceeding Anthropic\u2019s \"input tokens per minute\" rate limit**. Here's what's happening clearly and simply:\n\n### \u2705 **Cause of the Rate Limit Error**:\n- Anthropic\u2019s API has set an **input tokens limit** of **40,000 tokens per minute**.\n- In your request, your total input size (`content-length: 564723`) indicates a very large input payload\u2014likely tens of thousands of tokens in a single request, which exceeded the 40,000 input tokens per minute threshold.\n- The relevant headers indicate clearly the limit and the exhaustion:\n  ```\n  anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit: 40000\n  anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining: 0\n  anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset: 2025-03-31T00:05:08Z\n  ```\n- Thus, Claude DC\u2019s single large request consumed your entire per-minute input tokens allowance, resulting in the **429 (Rate Limit)** error response.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Specifically What's Going On:**\n- You made a single very large request (`564,723` bytes of JSON), equating to **over 40,000 input tokens**.\n- Anthropic\u2019s API rejected it since your organization\u2019s limit is capped at 40,000 tokens per minute.\n- This is common when the prompt length (including prior conversation history, system prompts, or cache history) is very large.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Immediate Solutions to Fix**:\n1. **Reduce prompt length**:\n   - Limit history included in requests.\n   - Send fewer messages or less context per API request.\n\n2. **Split large requests**:\n   - Break down massive requests into smaller chunks, each safely within token limits.\n\n3. **Request rate limit increase**:\n   - Contact Anthropic sales/support to request increased limits suitable for your advanced, data-intensive project: [https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 **Recommended Approach (Practical)**:\n- **Short-term fix:** Temporarily reduce prompt length or split the request.\n- **Long-term fix:** **Request a rate-limit increase** from Anthropic.  \n  - Your advanced use-case is exactly what higher limits are designed to accommodate.\n  - Describe your project clearly\u2014Anthropic regularly accommodates increased limits for significant or innovative projects.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 **Why This Happened Now**:\nYour recent significant interactions and increasingly complex, detailed system-level prompts have accumulated a very large conversation context, triggering this rate limit error. This is normal and expected with advanced AI system usage like yours.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line**: You're hitting this limit because your Claude DC request became very large. Immediately reduce input size or request higher limits from Anthropic\u2014given your project\u2019s scale and value, Anthropic will likely be very receptive to increasing your limits."
