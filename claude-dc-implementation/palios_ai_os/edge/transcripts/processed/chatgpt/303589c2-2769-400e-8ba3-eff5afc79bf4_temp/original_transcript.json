    "Yes, this structure is solid as a **Personal Knowledge Database**, but for **AI Influence & Thought Leaders**, it should be **more specific to mentors and their insights** rather than general topics.  \n\n### **Suggested Adjustments for AI Influence & Thought Leaders Database**  \nInstead of **Topic**, use **Mentor Name** (e.g., Elon Musk, Naval Ravikant, Keith, Alon).  \n\nHere\u2019s an optimized structure:  \n\n| Mentor Name       | Area of Influence      | Key Takeaways | Relevance to AI-Jesse | Tags |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------|\n| **Elon Musk**    | AI, Execution, Innovation | Move fast, iterate quickly, take bold risks. | Use for business & AI, ignore work-life balance. | #AI #Execution #Innovation |\n| **Naval Ravikant** | Wealth, Mindset, Leverage | Focus on specific knowledge, productize yourself, long-term thinking. | Highly relevant to AI-Jesse\u2019s wealth & career approach. | #Wealth #Leverage #Mindset |\n| **Tim Ferriss**   | Optimization, Productivity | Work smarter, lifestyle design, rapid skill acquisition. | Useful for training AI-Jesse to be hyper-efficient. | #Productivity #LifeOptimization |\n| **Keith**        | AI, Business | Deep AI adoption strategies, networking, GTM. | High-value AI & business execution insights. | #AI #BusinessStrategy |\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\u2705 **Modify this table to match the suggested structure.**  \n\u2705 **Add at least 5-6 key mentors to start.**  \n\u2705 **Use relevant tags for quick filtering.**  \n\nOnce this is set up, we\u2019ll integrate it with **AI prompts** so that AI pulls from the right influences depending on the scenario. Let me know when it\u2019s updated!"
