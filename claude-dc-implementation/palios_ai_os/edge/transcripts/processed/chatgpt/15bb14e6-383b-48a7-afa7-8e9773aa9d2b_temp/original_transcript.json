    "Ok, so first is a logistics question. I have photos and existing videos all over the place. My wife and son do as well and we'll all be taking photos and videos moving forward. What is the best way for us to be able to keep all his photos centrally located? Should I create him an iCloud account so we can easily keep them in one place since we all have iPhones?"
