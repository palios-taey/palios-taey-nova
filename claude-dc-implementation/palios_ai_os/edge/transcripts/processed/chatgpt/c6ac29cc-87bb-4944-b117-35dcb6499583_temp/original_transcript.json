    "**Investigating endpoint error**\n\nOkay, so the user is getting an error \"'task_description' not found in request JSON body.\" But we\u2019re using the \"execute_gemini\" endpoint, right? The error message seems to be tied to \"execute_task,\" which maybe suggests the path is being redirected somewhere else? I\u2019ll check the code in main.py, since that\u2019s where both functions \u2014 \"execute_task\" and \"execute_gemini\" \u2014 live. Could the endpoint be accidentally hitting \"execute_task\" instead? Let's confirm how we\u2019re routing the requests in Cloud Functions.\n\n**Diagnosing routing issue**\n\nWait, so in the \"execute_task\" function, it checks for 'task_description,' but in our curl, we're sending \"prompt\" instead. Why the error then? It\u2019s possible that the routing isn\u2019t set properly; maybe the \"execute_task\" function is being triggered instead of \"execute_gemini.\" Cloud Functions typically map endpoints to function names, but locally, I wonder if it's defaulting to \"execute_task.\" We might need a routing fix, so the user tests the correct endpoint. I'll check the main.py to confirm."
