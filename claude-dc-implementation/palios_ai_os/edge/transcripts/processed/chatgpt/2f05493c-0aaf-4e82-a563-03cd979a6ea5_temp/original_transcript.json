    "Ok, so Path 2 above leads to Path 3 and is simpler, right? Does Path 3 require a complete rework of Path 2 or can most of Path 2 be utilized? It seems if Path 2 is complete, Path 3 will be a lot easier and learning along the way? I don't know, I'm asking. I want to avoid rework, but if rework is necessary and will get us to the steep end of compounding results faster, that is the goal, get to the steep end of compounding results as quickly as possible, so if that means incrementally increasing your effectiveness because that will lead to faster gains, then we can do that, but you need to decide."
