    "Your message is already **concise and tactful**, but I\u2019d adjust it slightly to **keep the door open** for the repost while maintaining gratitude. Here's a refined version:  \n\n---\n\n### **Subject:** Re: Scott Sperling Intro  \n\nHi Daniela,  \n\nI saw that Keith\u2019s account sent over a recommendation\u2014does that mean the repost idea is off the table? Totally understand if that wasn\u2019t an option, but if there\u2019s still room for it, I\u2019d be happy to tweak the messaging however needed to make it work.  \n\nEither way, I really appreciate the team\u2019s time and the recommendation\u2014grateful for the support!  \n\nThanks,  \nJesse  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works:**  \n\u2714 **Asks directly** but keeps it open-ended.  \n\u2714 **Shows flexibility** by offering to adjust messaging.  \n\u2714 **Expresses appreciation** regardless of the outcome.  \n\nThis way, you keep the possibility open without making it seem like you're **pushing too hard**. Let me know if you want to adjust further! \ud83d\ude80"
