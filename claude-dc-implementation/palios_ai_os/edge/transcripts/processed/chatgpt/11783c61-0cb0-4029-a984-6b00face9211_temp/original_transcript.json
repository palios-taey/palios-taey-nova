    "Great! Next up is **Noah Kagan**. Since he\u2019s a bold, high-energy guy with a big audience, we want to make the message concise, direct, and aligned with his style\u2014focused on taking big swings. Here\u2019s the draft:  \n\n---\n\n**Hey Noah,**  \n\nI know you\u2019re all about taking big swings\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing tomorrow.  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market upside down, and I\u2019ve realized playing by the old rules isn\u2019t working.  \n\nSo I\u2019m launching an **AI career transformation experiment** and publicly documenting the journey.  \n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d love your help. A reshare would be amazing, but even just a like or comment could help it reach the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!  \n\nAppreciate it, man.  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\nThis keeps it **short, direct, and high-energy**\u2014which fits his style. If this works, send it over on LinkedIn! Then we\u2019ll move to the next."
