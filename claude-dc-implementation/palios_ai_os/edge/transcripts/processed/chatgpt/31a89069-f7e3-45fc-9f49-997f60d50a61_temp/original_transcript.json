    "These are 2 chats with significant resume revision history for various roles, plus how my resume is currently structured. This is an AI driven experiment and we aren't trying to make people comfortable, we're trying to guide them into the future and help them adapt, before it's too late. In the post, I almost feel like saying that, if you aren't interested in hiring like this and want to protect your headcount, you're going to lose, maybe not that blunt, but that's the reality as I understand it unless you differ. All in, with your help I am a thought leader, AI Explorer and everything else we talked about for the X profile in the Career pivot attachment. Please review all in detail. I think its also important that the AI section of the resume analyzing the current position being applied to explains why you are skilled enough to implement the AI that you are proposing, or what type of support you'd need from engineering resources, roughly estimated, to implement anything too complex. It should be credible that the person, with AI guidance on execution, would have enough understanding for the role and the technology required with guidance to implement or be clear on that."
