    "**Important clarification**: The current setup **does not** generate only one file per transcript file processed. Instead, it explicitly generates **one separate file per individual message or conversation unit** identified in your transcript files.\n\nHere's exactly what's happening clearly explained:\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **Current Behavior (as written right now):**\n\n- Your ChatGPT and Claude processors (`process_chatgpt_transcripts.py`, `process_claude_transcripts.py`) explicitly:\n  - Break down each **transcript file** (like a JSON containing multiple conversations) into multiple individual conversations/messages.\n  - **Each individual conversation/message** is then sent to the `edge_processor.py` separately.\n  - This results in the Edge Processor being called **multiple times per transcript file**, thus generating multiple files in `local_storage`.\n\n**Example clearly illustrated**:\n\n- **Transcript file** (`chatgpt.json`) contains **100 individual messages**.\n- **Your current processor script** creates **100 temporary JSON files** (one per message).\n- **Your current edge_processor.py** then clearly creates **100 result files** (one per message) in `local_storage`.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc **Your Question Clearly Addressed**:\n\nYou asked explicitly:\n\n> **\"Please confirm that this will only generate 1 file in local storage per transcript file processed.\"**\n\n- **Currently, the answer is clearly NO**.\n- Each message extracted from a transcript file explicitly creates a new file in `local_storage`.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **Recommended Adjustment (if one file per transcript is desired):**\n\nIf your **intention** is to generate exactly one single file per **transcript file** (rather than per message), here's explicitly what to do:\n\n- **Modify your processors** (`process_chatgpt_transcripts.py`, `process_claude_transcripts.py`) so they:\n  - Send the **entire set of messages from one transcript** as a single structured JSON file to the Edge Processor.\n  - Only call the Edge Processor once per original transcript file.\n\n- **Modify the Edge Processor (`edge_processor.py`) slightly**, ensuring it clearly handles and aggregates multiple messages into a single coherent set of patterns and results, storing exactly **one result file per original transcript**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea6 **Your Next Step (Important Decision)**:\n\nChoose clearly:\n\n- \u2705 **Option 1 (current)**: One file per conversation/message unit (**high granularity**, precise pattern tracking, multiple files).\n- \u2705 **Option 2 (modified)**: Exactly one file per transcript file (**lower granularity**, simpler tracking, fewer files).\n\n**Which approach clearly aligns best with your Trust framework and intended analysis?**\n\nLet me know your preference explicitly, and I'll immediately help you achieve exactly that."
