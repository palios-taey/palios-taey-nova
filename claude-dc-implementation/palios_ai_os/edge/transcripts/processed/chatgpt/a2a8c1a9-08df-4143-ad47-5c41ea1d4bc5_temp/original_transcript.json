    "Contributed Insights: The Singularity is Near - do you want this as a new page in PKD? There is one in there already called Singularity Roadmap\n\nYouTube is link/handle for their channel, Deep Learning for Decision-Making - do you want this as new page in PKD? there is already one for AI Decision Models i can link to.\n\nInfluences doesn't seem to be aligning with that table. These are fine for now because its just sample, but Influences here Relates to Goals & Principles. \n\nAI-Driven Decision Impact was not set up to be a drop down. I think AI was supposed to put text in there. You'll have to look back to review how we defined that column. let me know if there are updates needed there, you don't have to regenerate everything for this, rest of data is in, I think it was like a note to yourself on what areas of decision making the mentor impacts for you\n\nContributed Insights: AI-Enhanced Productivity: A Framework - There is one in PKD called Productivity Optimization. Do you want to create a new one or use this?\n\nWe'll need to standardize handle/link format for each social account in properties\n\nIt seems like all the related columns are confusing to you. Perhaps we should just name them as the default, which the the table they are linked to?\n\nInfluence Scope is Broad (all available content including feeds), Limited (only Active in Knowledge Base) And Inactive.\n\nSelected the correct entry in Knowledge base for Naval\nDone. Let me know your thoughts\n\n"
