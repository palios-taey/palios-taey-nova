    "Ok, I'm pretty much out of money in 3 months. I'm totally fucked and don't feel like I can just be looking for a job, not get one, and then be stuck in financial collapse. Is there anything else I can do besides like gamble or do stock options? The real estate market in south FL is terrible now as well, so that would be tough as well. I'm just venting because there is a very high probability I'll be living out of my van soon."
