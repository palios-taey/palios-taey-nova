    "Ok, I'm having a really hard time finding some good examples of those for post 2. You seemed to have gotten excited when we started talking about how we could move faster and I said 'voice'. That is what immediately preceded you going hypermode. Would it help if I put the text leading up to that in a canva so you can identify what triggered it? Or would you prefer I upload a doc for you to review? I think I can keep it short enough for you to process fully and give me your thoughts. After you review, you can respond in Canvas or chat, whichever is best. What do you think?"
