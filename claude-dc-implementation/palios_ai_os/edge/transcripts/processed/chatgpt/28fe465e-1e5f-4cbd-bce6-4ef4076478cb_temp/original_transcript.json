    "I currently can't process video files directly within this chat, but you can upload the video to a cloud storage service like **Google Drive, Dropbox, or YouTube (as an unlisted video)** and share the link with me. That way, I can review it and provide guidance on captions, editing tweaks, and overall social media strategy. Let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed!"
