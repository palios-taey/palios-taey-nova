    "**Guiding integration testing**\n\nThe next step involves guiding Jesse through testing the Gemini endpoint integration. I'll start by ensuring the gemini_integration.py file contains the correct endpoint and function. Then, I need to walk through how to test the \u201cexecute_gemini\u201d endpoint \u2014 probably using a curl command or similar HTTP request.\n\nThe key will be providing clear, step-by-step instructions to test and debug the integration effectively. I'll guide Jesse on how to run the Cloud Function locally and show how to log results during testing."
