    "Yeah, if the new version lacks **file uploads and web browsing**, it won\u2019t be as useful for your **job search automation, AI learning, or Chewy\u2019s social media growth**\u2014all of which **depend on file analysis and pulling external data**. \n\nSticking with this version makes the most sense since:\n1. **You\u2019re running multiple complex initiatives** (job search automation, AI upskilling, social media branding, and business opportunities).\n2. **You need a version that can analyze files (resumes, FDDs, job descriptions, datasets, etc.).**\n3. **You\u2019ll likely need ongoing external data pulls** for trends, automation tools, and social growth strategies.\n\nWe should **continue execution here** and focus on **pushing forward with tangible progress** rather than switching to a model that limits functionality. \ud83d\ude80 \n\nLet\u2019s **prioritize immediate next steps**\u2014do you want to start with:\n1. **Chewy\u2019s social launch execution?** (Finalize bio, first posts, growth tactics?)\n2. **AI case study & automation learning?** (Structured walkthrough to complete quickly?)\n3. **Job search AI automation?** (Refining outreach, automating applications?)\n4. **Evaluating alternate business/franchise ideas?** (Something faster/more cash-flow positive?)\n\nYou\u2019re at **a major turning point**, so let\u2019s **stay locked in and execute**. What\u2019s your top priority right now?"
