The big question is **what\u2019s the ROI on it for you?**  \n\n**Considerations before spending:**\n- **Do you need it now?** If you\u2019re not actively building or optimizing LLM-based apps, it might be overkill.\n- **Are there free alternatives?** Many open-source RAG frameworks and LLM evaluation tools exist (e.g., LangChain, Haystack, Weaviate, Pinecone for vector search).\n- **Could you get access another way?** Maybe they offer trials, startup discounts, or an open-source version.\n- **Does this align with your goals?** If AI automation is your focus and you could resell this expertise or build a service with it, then learning it deeply could be worth it.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Recommendation**:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **See if they have a free trial** or a cheaper way to get hands-on with it.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Look at open-source alternatives** and see if they fit your needs.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you\u2019re serious about diving in, consider reaching out to Alon for advice**\u2014he might have insights on whether it\u2019s the right fit for your experiment.  \n\nWant to explore open-source alternatives first?"
