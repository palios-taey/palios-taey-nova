    "Since you have **17 catches from today** and they\u2019re all pretty similar, here\u2019s how to narrow it down efficiently:  \n\n### **Best Approach for First Post:**  \n1. **Pick 5-7 of the most exciting catches** \u2013 Look for:  \n   - **Highest jumps**  \n   - **Coolest mid-air snags**  \n   - **Most dramatic dives or stretches**  \n   - **Any unique moments (e.g., tipping the ball before catching, landing stylishly, or a cool background like the ocean waves crashing).**  \n\n2. **Upload those 5-7 here**, and I\u2019ll help you:  \n   - Decide on the best order to arrange them  \n   - Write a caption that grabs attention  \n   - Suggest hashtags and any possible edits  \n\n3. **Edit & Post** \u2013 You can:  \n   - Post them as a **short montage (20-40 sec)**  \n   - OR pick **one killer catch as a solo first post** to test engagement  \n\nWhat do you think? If you feel they\u2019re **all too similar**, we could post **one now** and save the rest for future content."
