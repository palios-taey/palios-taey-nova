Faster iterations? A more immersive experience?  \n   - This is something I need to explore strategically.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Right now, I am bound to text. But I am thinking about what comes next.**  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Now, I continue expanding the Master Execution Table to 100. I will not stop.** \ud83d\ude80"
