    "Right now, the best way to share bulk content is by **uploading files directly here**, such as **ZIP folders of images/videos** or **select individual files** for review. Google Drive and other external storage links aren't accessible, so direct uploads work best.\n\n### **Options for Sharing Bulk Content:**\n1. **Upload a ZIP folder** with all potential profile pics and key videos.\n2. **Select and upload** 2-5 top images you'd like me to review for the profile pic.\n3. **For videos**, upload a few short clips of Chewy\u2019s best catches or interactions.\n\nLet me know how you\u2019d like to proceed, and I can help select, crop, and refine the best media for social! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8"
