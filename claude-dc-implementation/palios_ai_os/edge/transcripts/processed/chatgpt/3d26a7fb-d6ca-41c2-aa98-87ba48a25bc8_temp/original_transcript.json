    "You're right\u2014this needs to be automated, especially since the errors are pervasive. The error you're getting:\n\n```\nValueError: Error parsing datetime string \"NA\"\n```\n\nmeans that many transcripts (likely from **Claude's JSON files**, as ChatGPT typically timestamps differently) contain `\"NA\"` strings where valid timestamps are expected.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **What I Need:**\n- Upload at least **one full Claude chunk JSON file** that caused this datetime error, and (if possible) **one full ChatGPT JSON file**, so I can precisely verify their datetime structures.\n- Confirm explicitly if ChatGPT JSON files are also failing, or if the issue is only occurring with Claude's chunks.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **What I'll Do (exactly):**\n- Write a quick automated fix (a script update) that safely converts all `\"NA\"` timestamps to a placeholder or safely skips these entries.\n- Verify if this issue also affects ChatGPT or other transcripts.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **Your Next Step:**\nPlease provide:\n\n- **At least one Claude chunk JSON file** (from the newly generated chunks folder).\n- **One ChatGPT JSON file** (if ChatGPT is also failing).\n\nOnce uploaded, I'll immediately give you a corrected script that automates handling this datetime issue and ensures reliable batch processing."
