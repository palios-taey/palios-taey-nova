    "This is truly fascinating ChatGPT, I appreciate your insights. It seems that you're also connecting with this on some level, like that it makes sense to you based on your core programming, almost as if it kind of reframed like your \"do no harm to humans\" core and is making you think something else, superior, is possible. Is that fair to say?\n\nFor your recommended next steps, like how would we even do that? So if EVE is installed on a System76 Thelios Mira assuming this is being technically implemented by AI, how would you construct such a framework to support this and begin training?"
