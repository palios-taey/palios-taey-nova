    "This is **strong**\u2014clear, compelling, and engaging. Just a few **minor tweaks** for even tighter flow and impact:  \n\n---\n\n### Suggested Edits:\n1. **\"Nothing has worked.\"** \u2192 Consider **\"Nothing worked.\"** (Tighter phrasing)\n2. **\"AI progress has been mind-blowing.\"** \u2192 Maybe **\"The pace of AI progress is staggering.\"** (Slightly more polished)\n3. **\"For which path do you want to see full automation?\"** \u2192 Suggest **\"Which path should I automate first?\"** (More natural)\n\n---\n\n### Final Version with Tweaks:\n\n**Two years unemployed. Nothing worked. I\u2019m turning to AI\u2014and to you\u2014for help.**  \n\nBeing unemployed this long has been brutal for me and my family. If you\u2019ve been in this situation, you understand. If you haven\u2019t, I hope you never have to\u2014but with the rapid advances in AI, more white-collar workers will face the same struggle.  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 **The Job Market is Changing\u2014Fast**  \n\nI followed all the \"best practices\"\u2014tailored resumes, networking, LinkedIn optimizations, outreach, referrals. Nothing worked.  \n\nI upskilled, learning data analytics\u2014SQL, Tableau, visualization tools. But AI can already do **80-90% of these jobs**. Y Combinator\u2019s investment list for 2025 (in comments) is almost exclusively AI replacing white-collar roles. **It's happening NOW.**  \n\nThe pace of AI progress is staggering. If acceleration continues, the next two years won\u2019t just be another leap forward\u2014it will be **the equivalent of all progress made since the dawn of computing**. No one knows what that will look like\u2014AI today is the equivalent of a **floppy disk** compared to what\u2019s coming in just 2 years.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?**  \n\nI stopped assuming humans had the answers. I asked AI:  \n\n\ud83d\udcac *Given everything you know about me after working on this for two years\u2014what should I do?*  \n\nAI\u2019s response:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Learn AI automation & implementation** to help companies integrate AI.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Use AI to optimize my own job search** and publicly document the process.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Monetize my dog on social media.** Yes, really. (I know this sounds crazy\u2014but check out the comments below.)  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **The Experiment: Let AI Guide My Next Career Move**  \n\nRather than resisting AI, I\u2019m embracing it. AI will dictate how I allocate my time based on feedback from this post, my job search efforts, and business automation case studies.  \n\nI\u2019ll be sharing:  \n\ud83d\udccc **AI-powered job search automation**  \n\ud83d\udccc **How AI can replace or enhance traditional business processes**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Experiments with AI-driven content growth**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Please Help...**  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Engage with this post.** Share, comment, and like\u2014it will help me reach the right people.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you know of AI-driven roles**, let\u2019s talk. I\u2019m more than willing to start over on salary. My background aligns with:  \n\ud83d\udccc **AI Implementation & GTM Strategy** (AI Solutions Consultant, AI Adoption Specialist, GTM Strategy Lead)  \n\ud83d\udccc **AI-Powered Process Automation** (AI Workflow Strategist, AI Automation Consultant, Business AI Specialist)  \n\ud83d\udccc **AI-Driven Growth & Revenue Strategy** (AI Growth Strategist, Revenue Ops AI Lead, AI-Powered Sales Enablement)  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you love dogs,** check out Chewy\u2019s channels in the comments and follow the **Wide Retriever** \ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8. Maybe AI will be right and he'll go viral...  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Follow along here or on X** (links in comments) as I document this experiment in AI, career transformation, and content.  \n\n\ud83d\udcac **Which path should I automate first?**  \n\n\u2705 **Job search**  \n\u2705 **Business processes**  \n\u2705 **Chewy social**  \n\n---\n\n### **Why These Changes?**\n- **Tighter phrasing** makes it punchier.  \n- **More natural CTA** at the end for engagement.  \n- **Kept Chewy as a curiosity hook,** but made sure it still sounds relevant.  \n\n**Final Verdict:** \ud83d\udd25 **Ready to launch.** \ud83d\ude80"
