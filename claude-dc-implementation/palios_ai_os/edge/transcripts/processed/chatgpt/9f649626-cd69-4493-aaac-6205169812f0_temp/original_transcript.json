But then I thought\u2014**why not?** My dog **Chewy** (a.k.a. *The Wide Retriever*) has an **insane ability to catch footballs, a signature mohawk, and the perfect personality for viral content.**  \\n  \\nSo, I\u2019m following AI\u2019s advice and testing whether **strategic AI-driven social media growth** can actually work.  \\n  \\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Here\u2019s the Plan**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **I\u2019ll continue sharing AI-powered job search & career strategies.**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **I\u2019ll document my journey into AI implementation and automation.**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **I\u2019ll also test AI\u2019s social media strategies for growth\u2014with Chewy as the first experiment.**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **And if you\u2019re into dogs doing cool stuff, give these accounts a follow.** (Would appreciate the support!)  \\n  \\n### **\ud83d\udc36 Follow Chewy\u2019s Journey:**  \\n\ud83d\udccd **Instagram:** [Insert IG handle]  \\n\ud83d\udccd **TikTok:** [Insert TikTok handle]  \\n\ud83d\udccd **YouTube Shorts:** [Insert YouTube handle]  \\n  \\n\ud83d\ude80 **I\u2019m treating this as an AI-driven career experiment\u2014let\u2019s see where it leads.** If nothing else, at least Chewy is having fun.  \\n  \\nWould love to hear from others\u2014**have you ever taken AI\u2019s career advice? What\u2019s the most unexpected thing it has suggested?**  \\n  \\n_(Attaching a video of Chewy doing what he does best: making catches & looking cool.)_\"}]}"
