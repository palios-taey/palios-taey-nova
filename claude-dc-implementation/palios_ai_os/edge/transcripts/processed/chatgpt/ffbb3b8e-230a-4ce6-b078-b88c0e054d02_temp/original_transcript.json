    "Here's the command to safely copy the `loop.py` file from Claude DC's home directory (`~/computer_use_demo/loop.py`) to the archive directory in your current GitHub repo (`~/github/palios-taey-nova/archive/`):\n\n```bash\ncp ~/computer_use_demo/loop.py ~/github/palios-taey-nova/archive/\n```\n\nRun this command in the terminal, then let me know when that's complete. After you copy it, please upload the copied file here, and we\u2019ll carefully implement the `USE_STREAMING` functionality without disrupting existing features."
