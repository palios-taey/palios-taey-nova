    "Your wording is close, but a slight refinement would improve clarity and impact. Here's a revised version:\n\n**\"Led the development of AI/ML algorithms for SKU categorization and revenue projection, securing a $10M budget for dedicated Engineering and BI resources.\"**\n\n### Explanation:\n- **\"Led the creation of\"** is changed to **\"Led the development of\"** to make it sound more technically aligned with the process of building AI/ML algorithms.\n- **\"AI/ML algorithms\"** is kept as-is, which is accurate and relevant.\n- **\"Securing a $10M budget\"** flows well but could also be phrased as **\"securing $10M in funding\"** depending on preference, but both work fine here.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further tweaks!"
