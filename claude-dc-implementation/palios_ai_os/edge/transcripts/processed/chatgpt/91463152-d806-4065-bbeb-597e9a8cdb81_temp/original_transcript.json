    "Yes, the **best logistical approach** is:  \n\n### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Wait for Keith\u2019s Post to Drop (Timing Matters)**\n- **Monitor when it goes live.** As soon as it\u2019s up, engage quickly:  \n  - **Like + Comment immediately**  \n  - **Reply to early engagement** to boost visibility  \n  - **DM key supporters** to thank them & nudge for engagement  \n\n---\n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Follow Up With Your Own Post (Day 0 Recap & Next Steps)**\n- **Timing:** **4-6 hours after Keith\u2019s post** (or next morning if engagement is strong)  \n- **Why?** **Riding the momentum** while not stepping on the main post\u2019s reach  \n- **What to include?**\n  - **Key outcomes from Day 0**\n    - Connections made (Alon, Ferrazzi, Keith\u2019s team, etc.)\n    - Big takeaways (e.g., AI is already shaping the job market)\n  - **Big next steps** (RagMetrics project + full AI execution plan)  \n  - **Commitment to first AI project (with timeline)**  \n  - **Engagement ask** \u2013 Get people to **vote, weigh in, or suggest**  \n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Engage Heavy for Next 24-48 Hours**\n- **Reply to every comment on both Keith\u2019s post & yours**  \n- **DM new connections & follow-ups** (leverage interest while it\u2019s hot)  \n- **Drive further reposts** (use Keith\u2019s post as validation)  \n\n---\n\n### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Build Toward AI Project Post (Target: Thursday or Friday)**\n- Post outlining **exactly what you\u2019re building with RagMetrics**  \n- Show progress & involve your audience  \n- Get feedback/input for **virality & buy-in**  \n\nThis **keeps engagement rolling while pushing forward momentum.**  \n\n### **What do you think?
