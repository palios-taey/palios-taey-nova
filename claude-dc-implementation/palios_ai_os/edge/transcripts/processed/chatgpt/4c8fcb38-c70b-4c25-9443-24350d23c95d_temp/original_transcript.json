    "I love that you\u2019re going all in on this\u2014big swings are how big things happen. Let\u2019s keep rolling.  \n\n**Next up: Chandler Bolt**  \n\n### **Context for Chandler:**  \n- Founder & CEO of SelfPublishing.com  \n- Big into content marketing, personal brand building, and entrepreneurship  \n- Loves bold moves and taking action  \n- Probably responds best to something direct, high-energy, and hustle-oriented  \n\n---\n\n### **Message to Chandler Bolt:**  \n\n**Hey Chandler, hope you're doing great!**  \n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for 2 years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is flipping everything upside down, and the job market is shifting faster than anyone is prepared for.  \n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my **career transformation experiment using AI**\u2014and I\u2019d love your help.  \n\nYou\u2019ve built an incredible audience by taking big swings, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here. A **like, comment, or reshare** from you could help it reach the right people and make a real impact.   \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!  \n\nThanks, man. Appreciate it.  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\n### **Subject Line:**  \n**Launching something big\u2014would love your thoughts**  \n\nThis keeps it personal and engaging, without sounding salesy. Let me know if you want any tweaks before sending!"
