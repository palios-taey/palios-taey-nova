    "Some thoughts on the linkedin post. \nDoes me recapping my previous experience sound whiny and bitter? What are your thoughts on whether or not it should be included?\n\nClearly I do not have any experience in AI. Does only posting about these roles seem like I'm expecting things I have no qualifications for? I know it says I'm willing to start over on salary, but just double checking. \n\nOn the Kurzweil, 2028 will sound crazy to most people, what do you think? I was thinking it would be funny and put it into context if made a joke about how its almost like all we need is something to link AI to the brain. Like \"brainlink\", but that's not the name, I've never good at branding. Maybe someone really smart with a lot of money will figure that out???\n\nI'll also be sharing on X, here's where to find me if you prefer.\n\nOk, with whatever you think. I feel like I pushed this stuff, but if not and you think it's best, we can leave it and/or not incorporate new stuff. Please just don't do what I say or allow me to manipulate. I want this really to be AI driven and decided."
