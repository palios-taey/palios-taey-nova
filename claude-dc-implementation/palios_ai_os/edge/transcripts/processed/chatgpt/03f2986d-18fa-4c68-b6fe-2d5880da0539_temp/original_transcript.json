So as of now, we're not testing it, but are building something to test for Monday, here's a preview(described in next bullet based on where we are now) with next steps to determine format. \n\nI don't know if we'll get there to applying and everything before Keith's post drops, so let's word it for now to check the PDF attachment for an example of a marketing automation manager role with how AI would approach it.\n\nNeed to better capture the concept of human combining experience, skills and education, its not how well can you implement AI, it's how can you leverage the experience, skills, and education you have with AI to combine forces and systemize everything you know. \n\nI liked what you had a lot more in the outline, I don't think a lot came through.\n\nAnd the only people who will be relevant in the next 12 months are those who know how to work with AI as a force multiplier for their experience and that are willing to accept that \n\nThe concept of a job is changing faster than anyone realizes.
