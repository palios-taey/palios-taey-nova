    "Yes, you can use your LLC to set up a **Solo 401(k)**. As long as you have self-employment income, you qualify to establish a Solo 401(k), even if you're a sole proprietor or a single-member LLC. This would allow you to roll over funds from your IRA into the Solo 401(k) and potentially borrow against it if needed.\n\n### Wealthfront and Solo 401(k)s:\n**Wealthfront** currently does not offer Solo 401(k) plans. Wealthfront specializes in **automated investing and robo-advisory services**, so you would need to look at other financial institutions that provide Solo 401(k) options.\n\n### Recommended Providers for Solo 401(k) Plans:\nHere are a few reputable financial institutions that offer Solo 401(k) plans:\n\n1. **Fidelity**:\n   - Fidelity offers no-fee Solo 401(k) plans with no minimum investments and access to a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. \n   - It also allows for rollovers from IRAs.\n\n2. **Vanguard**:\n   - Vanguard\u2019s Solo 401(k) offers low-cost mutual funds and ETFs. However, it does not allow Roth contributions or loans, so that could be a drawback if you're looking for those features.\n\n3. **Charles Schwab**:\n   - Schwab offers Solo 401(k) plans with no account fees or minimums. You can invest in a variety of assets, and Schwab does allow for 401(k) loans.\n\n4. **E*TRADE**:\n   - E*TRADE provides Solo 401(k) plans that support both Roth and Traditional contributions, and they also allow for loans. It offers a robust platform for self-directed investors.\n\n### Setting Up the Solo 401(k):\n1. **Choose a Provider**: Once you've selected a provider (e.g., Fidelity, Schwab, etc.), you'll need to contact them to open a Solo 401(k).\n2. **Rollover Process**: After your Solo 401(k) is established, you can initiate a **direct rollover** from your IRA to your new 401(k) account. This prevents any tax penalties.\n3. **Loan Option**: Once the rollover is complete, check the rules with the provider to see how much you can borrow and under what terms.\n\nBy using your LLC and opening a Solo 401(k), you can start planning for the future while potentially accessing the funds you need."
