    "You're doing great! The **IndentationError** is just a formatting issue. Let's correct it and try again.\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Corrected Python Code for Step 2**\nCopy and paste this **exactly** into Python:\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ntry:\n    output = subprocess.run([\"gcloud\", \"--version\"], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)\n    print(\"\u2705 gcloud is working inside Python:\", output.stdout)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"\u274c gcloud is NOT found in Python.\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Expected Output**\n1. **If `gcloud` works**, you'll see something like:\n   ```\n   \u2705 gcloud is working inside Python: \n   Google Cloud SDK 512.0.0\n   bq 2.1.13\n   cloud-run-proxy 0.5.0\n   core 2025.02.21\n   gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0\n   gsutil 5.33\n   ```\n2. **If it still fails**, you'll see:\n   ```\n   \u274c gcloud is NOT found in Python.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 What To Do Next**\n- **If `gcloud` works in Python** \u2192 The issue is in the script, not the installation.\n- **If Python still can\u2019t find `gcloud`**, we\u2019ll need to force Python to use the full path.\n\nLet me know what happens! \ud83d\ude80"
