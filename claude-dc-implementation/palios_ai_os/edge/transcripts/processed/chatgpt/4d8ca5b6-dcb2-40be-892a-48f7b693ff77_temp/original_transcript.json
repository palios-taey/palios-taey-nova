    "Perfect! Since you have a solid batch of clips from the past two days, let's **prioritize** which ones fit best for each post.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Selecting the Right Clips**\n- **Hero Introduction Post:**  \n  - Needs a **clean, high-quality catch** where he looks like an absolute pro.  \n  - Ideally, a **mid-air grab or a dramatic catch** where he\u2019s focused on the ball.  \n  - A **close-up personality shot** to showcase his charm.  \n\n- **First Viral Attempt Post:**  \n  - **The little dog barking/chasing him before the catch sounds GOLD.**  \n  - This clip **has storytelling potential** (little dog challenging Chewy, then he makes the grab).  \n  - This kind of **unexpected interaction is highly shareable.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Preparing the Clips**\n- **Trim clips** to the best moment (under **10-15 seconds max** for TikTok, IG Reels, and X).  \n- Add a **slow-motion effect** at the end for dramatic effect (optional).  \n- Make sure the **lighting is good**\u2014brightness can be adjusted if needed.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Post Order & Scheduling**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Post Hero Introduction First** \u2013 Establishes the brand, pins the post.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Post the Viral Attempt Clip Second** \u2013 To drive immediate engagement and shares.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Your Next Steps:**\n- **Review the clips** and pick the best ones for each post.  \n- Let me know if you want guidance on **simple trimming/editing tools.**  \n- Upload the clips here (or in a Drive folder), and I\u2019ll help craft final captions.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Would you like help choosing which clips to use?**"
