    "Ok, sounds good, can I get a little statement for Claude DC under the first one about how to manage secrets? I don't want do the files yet, I'd prefer for him to tell me AI FIRST way he wants it, but just let him know it will be in whatever the path will be on my machine in home. If you need me to put in placeholders I can. I'd also like for him to create a file in there and leave it open for me so I can replicate the format on my end. That way, he doesn't have to stop to respond to me. How do I say that in a little blurb?"
