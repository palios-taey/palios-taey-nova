    "### Analysis of the Current Output:\n\nThe script is executing correctly, which is a good first step:\n\n- **Patterns loaded successfully**: \n  ```\n  Bach router initialized with 1279 patterns\n  ```\n- **No Import Errors**: Python imports are now resolved properly.\n\n### Issues Observed:\n\n- **Uniform Routing**: All messages are consistently routed to `chatgpt` with similar, low-confidence scores (`~0.27`).\n- **Low Confidence and Similarity**: Every AI option (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) is nearly identical in confidence scores, indicating limited differentiation.\n\nThis strongly suggests one of these issues:\n\n1. **Pattern embeddings or matching logic** is not differentiating between patterns.\n2. **Insufficient or incorrect pattern data** loaded into `TranscriptProcessor`.\n3. **Embedding or similarity scoring method** needs adjustment.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Next Step (No Overly Rigid Plan):\n\nWe need clarity on how patterns are loaded and scored.\n\n### \u2705 **Action Step for You to Provide Context**:\n\nRun the following diagnostic snippet to **inspect** the loaded patterns directly and share the output with me. This is a minimal, easy-to-execute step providing critical insight.\n\n**Create and run:** `inspect_patterns.py` in the root (`claude-dc-implementation`) directory.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\npattern_file = \"data/patterns/pattern_report.json\"\n\nwith open(pattern_file, \"r\") as file:\n    patterns = json.load(file)\n\nprint(f\"Total patterns loaded: {sum(len(v) for v in patterns.values())}\")\n\nfor category, pats in patterns.items():\n    print(f\"\\nCategory: {category}, Patterns: {len(pats)}\")\n    for i, pat in enumerate(pats[:3], 1):\n        print(f\"  {i}. {pat['text']} (confidence: {pat.get('confidence', 'N/A')})\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 **What I'll Learn From This**:\n- Confirm exactly **what pattern data** has been loaded.\n- See if **confidence values** are accurate or missing.\n- Understand the **distribution and differentiation** of pattern data by category.\n\nOnce you run this and share the output, I can give you an immediate and targeted next step to fix the uniform routing issue."
