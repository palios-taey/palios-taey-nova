    "Great! Now that Instagram is set up, let's continue with the next steps:\n\n### **1. Set Up X (Twitter)**\n- Go to [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com) and create an account using **wideretrieverchewy** as the handle.\n- For **Full Name**, use something similar to Instagram, like **Wide Retriever Chewy**.\n- Optimize your **bio** (we\u2019ll finalize bios across platforms soon).\n- Upload a **profile picture** and **banner** (you can use a beach scene or something sporty).\n- Follow relevant accounts (we\u2019ll cover this after all accounts are created).\n\n### **2. Set Up TikTok**\n- Go to [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) and create an account.\n- Use **wideretrieverchewy** as the username if available.\n- Add the same **Full Name** as Instagram/X for consistency.\n- Set up the profile picture and bio.\n- Enable **Business Account** mode (this will allow you to track analytics and grow more effectively).\n\n### **3. Set Up YouTube**\n- Create a **YouTube Channel** using your Google account.\n- Set the channel name to **Wide Retriever Chewy**.\n- Upload branding (banner, profile pic).\n- Choose between **YouTube Shorts focus** or a mix of short/long-form content.\n\n### **4. Troubleshoot Facebook**\n- Since you had issues, you might need to wait before retrying. We can work on this once the other platforms are fully set up.\n\n### **5. Prepare First Batch of Content**\n- Gather the best clips from today\u2019s beach session + past footage (puppy days, interactions with people, etc.).\n- Decide on **video themes** (we can create categories like \"Wide Receiver Highlights,\" \"Chewy vs. Humans,\" \"Chewy's Funniest Moments\").\n- Edit the first 3-5 videos (we can discuss the best approach for this next).\n\nLet me know once you\u2019re ready to move to the next step! \ud83d\ude80"
