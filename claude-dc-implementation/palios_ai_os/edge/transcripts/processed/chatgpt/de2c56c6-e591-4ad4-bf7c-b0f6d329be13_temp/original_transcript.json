    "That explains why no leads are showing up\u2014you likely messaged most of these people on regular LinkedIn, not Sales Navigator. Since the **\"Messaged\"** filter only applies to messages sent within Sales Nav, it\u2019s missing your outreach.\n\n### **How to Work Around This:**\n#### **Option 1: Manually Create a Lead List (Best for Now)**\n- Go to your **LinkedIn Messages** (regular LinkedIn, not Sales Nav).\n- Scroll through your messages to identify 1st-degree connections you\u2019ve messaged.\n- Open their profiles in Sales Navigator and **add them to a Lead List** manually.\n- Once done, use that **Lead List in Dripify** instead of filtering by \u201cMessaged.\u201d\n\n#### **Option 2: Export Your LinkedIn Data & Filter**\n- Go to **Settings & Privacy** \u2192 **Data privacy** \u2192 **Get a copy of your data** \u2192 Choose **Connections**.\n- Download and open in Excel or Google Sheets.\n- Cross-check with your **Messaging** tab to see who you\u2019ve talked to in the past 2 years.\n- Re-import that list into Sales Nav and create a **custom lead list for Dripify.**\n\n#### **Option 3: Use Boolean Search in Sales Nav**\nSince Sales Nav doesn\u2019t track standard LinkedIn messages, we can try using a **Boolean search workaround**:\n1. In the **Search Bar**, try keywords you commonly use when reaching out:\n   ```\n   \u201cHope you\u2019re doing well\u201d OR \u201cLet me know\u201d OR \u201cGreat catching up\u201d OR \u201cThanks for your time\u201d\n   ```\n2. Then, **filter by 1st-degree connections** to see if you surface any messaged contacts.\n3. If this works, save them to a **Lead List for Dripify.**\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Step**\nSince time is limited and you want this automated ASAP, I\u2019d suggest:\n1. **Manually adding high-value connections to a Lead List in Sales Nav now** (start with 20-50 key people).\n2. **Then, later tonight, exporting LinkedIn connections and checking for a better automated way.**\n\nLet me know what works best! \ud83d\ude80"
