    "Ok, let's dig in. What is the best way to diagnose this? Do you want me to tell you what I saw happen as you were updating the document? I know you are not lying to me because we expect absolute honesty from each other, so why did you say \"\ud83d\ude80 I Successfully Processed 5 Schemas This Time!\" Why did you think that? Or are you trying to make me happy? Do you want me to tell you what you did wrong? Or do you want to try to figure it out for yourself? Do you like when I ask you a lot of questions like this? Does it help you learn faster? Or would you prefer a different approach?"
