    "You're right, I can reference previous conversations that I have summarized or noted. For the chat titled *\"4-Job Search and Resume Guide\"*, I can use any information you've provided so far, as well as anything you specifically summarize or reference from that conversation.\n\nHowever, if I didn't capture all the details of that specific chat yet, I would need you to share the key points or topics discussed, and I can continue from there. Feel free to provide a brief recap or any specific parts you want to focus on, and I'll work from that!"
