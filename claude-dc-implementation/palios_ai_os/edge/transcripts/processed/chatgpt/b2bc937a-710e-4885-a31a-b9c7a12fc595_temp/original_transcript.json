What about this statement?\n\nThe future is in experiences. Selling yourself, travel services, and offering experiences. \n\nInterpersonal relationships cannot be automated. A human connection - mind, body and soul - can never be replicated by machine. \n\nThe next frontier is in selling experiences."
