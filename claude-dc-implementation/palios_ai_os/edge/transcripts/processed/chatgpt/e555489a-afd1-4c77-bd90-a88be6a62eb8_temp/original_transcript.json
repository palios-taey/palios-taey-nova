    "Now that I'm fully caught up on the chat and reviewed the documents, here\u2019s where we are:\n\n### **LinkedIn Post Strategy: The BIG Idea & Experiment**\nWe need to clearly communicate:\n1. **The Big Idea:**  \n   - Traditionally, candidates are evaluated based on **experience, skills, and education**.  \n   - But in an AI-driven world, the most important qualification is **the ability to apply those things effectively to implement AI solutions**.  \n   - This shifts how hiring should work, **focusing on execution over years of experience**.\n\n2. **The Experiment:**  \n   - **We are putting this theory to the test.**  \n   - We\u2019ll take a **real job** and use **AI to reframe qualifications** around AI implementation.  \n   - **Hiring managers & recruiters:** If you have a job, submit it.  \n   - **Job seekers:** If you want to see how your role could be structured differently, submit a job description.  \n   - If no one submits, **we\u2019ll find one ourselves and build an automation for it by Monday.**\n\n3. **Update on Post Metrics & Thank You:**  \n   - Quick **recap of the first post's success** (reposts, impressions, engagement).  \n   - **Thank everyone** for contributing.  \n\n4. **Decision on Chewy:**  \n   - **Chewy remains a long-term play**, but we\u2019re focusing on AI first.  \n   - **Automating content strategy in the background** for slow, organic growth.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Decisions Before Posting**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **One Post or Two?**\n   - **Option 1:** One **long, high-impact post**.  \n     - \u2705 Keeps momentum, full engagement in one place.  \n     - \u274c Might be too much in one post, reducing focus.  \n   - **Option 2:** **Two posts** (one for AI strategy, one for personal updates).  \n     - \u2705 Separates AI strategy from personal updates, increases engagement over time.  \n     - \u274c More posts to manage, might spread the impact thin.\n\n**My Take:** One post is probably stronger because the two updates are closely related. But we could split the **Big Idea + Experiment** into one post and **Metrics + Chewy** into another.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **How to Frame the Ask for a Job**\n   - **Approach 1:** Directly ask for job submissions in the post.  \n   - **Approach 2:** Ask in the comments instead, keeping the post itself more engaging.  \n   \n   **My Take:** Asking in the post is better\u2014it increases visibility and engagement. But we should also **pin a comment** reinforcing the ask.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Finalize the LinkedIn post draft** (decide between one post or two).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Decide how to follow up on Keith Krach\u2019s post** (wait or check in).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Lock in AI Job Application Automation details for Monday** (data inputs, scraping method).  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Prepare for the Alon call on Tuesday** (script key talking points).  \n\nDo you want me to draft the LinkedIn post first, or focus on one of the other action items? \ud83d\ude80"
