    "You're getting a dependency conflict with `ml-dtypes` involving TensorFlow and Keras.\n\n### What's happening:\n\n- **TensorFlow-rocm 2.14.0** specifically requires:\n  ```\n  ml-dtypes==0.2.0\n  ```\n- **Keras 3.9.1** (or some higher versions) explicitly requires:\n  ```\n  ml-dtypes>=0.3.1\n  ```\n- You've explicitly requested:\n  ```\n  ml-dtypes==0.5.1\n  ```\n\nThis creates an unsolvable conflict because these packages require incompatible versions of `ml-dtypes`.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Immediate Solution:\n\nAdjust your `requirements.txt` to resolve the conflict clearly:\n\nReplace the existing `ml-dtypes` line with a version compatible across your stack. For maximum compatibility, use:\n\n```bash\nml-dtypes==0.2.0\n```\n\nAnd adjust your `Keras` version to one compatible with that:\n\n```bash\nkeras==2.14.0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Adjusted `requirements.txt` snippet for clarity:\n\n```\ntensorflow-rocm==2.14.0\nml-dtypes==0.2.0\nkeras==2.14.0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1. **Update your requirements.txt:**\n\nReplace or add clearly:\n\n```bash\nml-dtypes==0.2.0\nkeras==2.14.0\n```\n\n2. **Rerun the setup script:**\n\n```bash\n./scripts/setup.sh\n```\n\nThis resolves your conflict while keeping TensorFlow, Keras, and ml-dtypes compatible.\n\n---\n\n### Why these versions?\n\n- `TensorFlow-rocm 2.14.0` and `ml-dtypes 0.2.0` are a tested, compatible pair.\n- Keras `2.14.0` is known stable and compatible with TensorFlow 2.14.x.\n\nThis will ensure stability and avoid the complicated dependency conflict you're seeing.\n\nAfter making these adjustments, rerun the script again\u2014it should now complete without errors."
