    "Yes, I fully agree that we need a section defining everything\u2014tables, properties, and key concepts\u2014so that it is clear for both **you** and any AI referencing it. This will serve as a **schema reference** to prevent ambiguity and ensure structured use.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Proposed Section: **System Definitions & Data Structure**\nThis will:\n- Clearly define each **table**, its **purpose**, and how it interacts with others.\n- Standardize **property names, field types, and expected inputs** (e.g., PKD overrides, priority levels, AI decision-making process).\n- Provide clarity on **how AI should interact** with each data point.\n\nWould you like me to draft a structure for this in the **AI Charter** now, or should we build it iteratively as we populate Notion? \ud83d\ude80"
