    "That could be an **amazing** content angle. The contrast between a big, energetic dog like Chewy and a tiny guinea pig is instant engagement material.  \n\nIf you want to mix that into a post, here are **two song choices** that would work well:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **\"Lean on Me\" \u2013 Bill Withers** (Classic, emotional, fits interspecies friendship perfectly)  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **\"Count on Me\" \u2013 Bruno Mars** (More upbeat, modern, and playful)  \n\nYou could frame it as *\"Unlikely friendships are the best friendships\"*, then encourage people to share pics of their pets\u2019 unexpected best friends. That\u2019s the kind of post that gets **big engagement** because people love showing off their animals.  \n\nWould you want to tie this into the Chewy & Cody post or keep them separate?"
