    "Based on the screenshot you provided, it seems the **dashboard UI itself** is still showing the server as **offline**, despite the logs confirming that the backend MCP connector has successfully connected and the health endpoint is responding with \"healthy.\"\n\n### What's Happening:\n\n- The backend (`dashboard_mcp_connector.py`) correctly reports:\n  ```\n  Server health checked: healthy\n  ```\n- However, the Streamlit frontend (`dashboard_app.py`) still shows:\n  ```\n  Server Status: Offline\n  System Health (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini): Offline\n  ```\n\nThis means the backend is good, but the frontend isn't correctly pulling or interpreting the status from the backend.\n\n---\n\n### What To Do Next:\n\nPlease share the following file, as it's likely where the issue lies:\n\n- **`dashboard_app.py`**\n\nI\u2019ll then be able to help you quickly pinpoint and fix the frontend status display issue."
