    "**Investigating token issue**\n\nIt looks like the OAuth2 token retrieval failed because the response only includes an \"id_token\" and no \"access_token.\" Typically, when using service account credentials, you expect to receive an \"access_token.\" But in this case, it seems the response only gave an \"id_token.\" This is tricky since the \"id_token\" is used for identity verification, but we need an \"access_token\" for API calls. Our code expects a \"token,\" but it\u2019s not clear why the response doesn't include one.\n\n**Identifying token issue**\n\nBy default, the google-auth service account credentials should return an \"access_token,\" not an \"id_token.\" But, specific configurations like an audience parameter may cause the \"id_token\" to appear instead. The generative language API expects an \"access_token,\" and the error suggests the token refresh didn\u2019t get it. We need to check if we\u2019re using the correct configuration for the API. The documentation also mentions that using `with_target_audience` gives an \"id_token,\" so we might not be calling it, or our scopes could be affecting things."
