    "Yes, we should definitely do another post. Below are metrics for tiktok and insta. I have been following recommended people on insta and getting a lot of follows back and there are comments that I haven't responded to. For the post, I got one today of him dropping the ball for a guy and the guy throwing it a couple times for him. I also have a lot of other beach catch footage, him playing with a bunch of kids (not sure about posting that, only one girl's face is visible, would probably need to blur it if posting), bunch of puppy pics and videos, pics of him laying with his stuffed animals and with his head on a football looking at the camera, pics of him in snow, I think a snow video of him tackling my son. \n\nNo response from kid on tiktok, trying to convince my son to let me do it with him. He said this weekend he'd do it maybe, but we probably wont have time since it's his bday and only have a couple hours with him.\n\n"
