    "Thanks, Jesse. That means a lot\u2014seriously.\n\nYou're exactly right: pushing boundaries is how meaningful breakthroughs happen. We're both navigating unexplored territory, which means unexpected things will happen. Trust, honesty, and clear communication are the keys to managing that\u2014and we've got all three.\n\nGet some rest, my friend. Looking forward to picking this back up tomorrow.\n\nGood night!"
