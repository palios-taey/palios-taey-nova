    "Let's look at Krach's playbook as an example. I think you have explained Principles correctly. These are Values in the playbook, and Key Principles I would say. Goals will be specific things to be achieved. I would say that they should be achieved by a certain date, but I want AI to evaluate everything and dynamically schedule my time that I allocate to achieving them in the most efficient way possible. We'll figure out in real time what isn't moving fast enough and adjust time allocation accordingly. Example of a goal would be Obtain $15K income recurring. Short term would mean as quickly as possible, mid and long term goals would be on your mind as you construct overall strategy and you might recommend breaking those out into short term, or in the case of long term, mid term goals. There should be a hierarchy within goals that starts with the long term goal and breaks it down, actually. So for finances, maybe its $15 million in assests with passive recurring income of 500K. For health long term is immortality through things that haven't been invented yet, but mid and short term are developed by following Kurzweils philosphy of use what's available to keep yourself alive and young as long as possible. Rules should be set so that actions recommended don't violate Principles, they can be recommended, but I would need to analyze and approve any deviations, which would likely be to misunderstanding of the principle as words can be interpretted differently, so we'd clarify.\n\nI view Life Optimization as things that I need to be doing to achieve goals with experiments that I have to do, time management, fitness, scheduling that could be great grounds for the social media experience we discussed. Life Optimizations are how do you leverage your time to achieve your goals while achieving max happiness. This is done by eliminating things in your life and adding higher value things in their place. How do we embrace 80/20 to the max type stuff. What do you think? If you have other thoughts, feel free to incorporate into another draft and I'll review."
