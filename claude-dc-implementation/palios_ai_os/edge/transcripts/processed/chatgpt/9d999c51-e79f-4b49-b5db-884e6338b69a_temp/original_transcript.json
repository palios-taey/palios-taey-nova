    "Ok, thanks for that analysis. I think we're good on the trust part because he did a great job the first time with the initial prompt and we came up with a new structure for him to operate as The Conductor uninterrupted unless he gets stuck in an error more than 1 try. What I wanted to accomplish with the 2nd set is to get the transcript processing infrastructure built so we can run it if he hits a limit and then move on to dashboard and everything else. Last time it looked like he did all the EVE and MCP stuff first, so that is different in v2 and I'm not sure if that is correct. I also don't want to lose any of the high level objectives from the first one, just dial it in on the first couple so that we can use whatever is built as its built. Does that make sense? With that additional context does that change anything? Is v2 OK to use or would you make edits?  "
