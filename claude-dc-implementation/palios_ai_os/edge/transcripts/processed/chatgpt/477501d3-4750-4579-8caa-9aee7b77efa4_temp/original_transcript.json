    "Thanks for clarifying that your background includes elements of sales enablement and partnerships but not as full-time or primary roles. This insight is important because while we can position you for certain roles by leveraging those aspects of your experience, the degree to which they\u2019re emphasized might need to shift. Let me reassess based on your broader experience across multiple conversations and resumes to ensure we're aligned with the most realistic and achievable opportunities for you.\n\n---\n\n### **Updated Assessment of Your Background**\nFrom what I\u2019ve gathered:\n1. **Your Strengths:**\n   - **Strategic Operations**: You\u2019ve led significant process improvements (e.g., Pollen\u2019s CRM build, OJCommerce\u2019s vendor onboarding, Mirakl\u2019s GTM strategy) and optimized workflows, which shows strong operational and strategic thinking.\n   - **Revenue Growth**: You\u2019ve consistently contributed to scaling revenue through data-driven approaches, process improvements, and vendor onboarding initiatives.\n   - **E-commerce Experience**: Your track record in scaling OJCommerce and working with platforms like Mirakl shows a deep understanding of online marketplaces, SaaS, and retail ecosystems.\n   - **Data-Driven Insights**: With your recent upskilling in data analytics (Google Data Analytics Certification, SQL training), you\u2019re positioning yourself to complement your operational expertise with analytics.\n\n2. **Stretch Areas:**\n   - **Sales Enablement**: While you\u2019ve implemented CRM systems, developed training materials, and optimized sales processes, sales enablement hasn\u2019t been a dedicated focus of your roles.\n   - **Partnerships**: You\u2019ve negotiated and managed key partnerships (e.g., Pollen, CommerceHub), but this hasn\u2019t been a core function across multiple roles.\n   - **Data Analytics as a Core Skill**: You\u2019re still building foundational technical skills (SQL, Tableau, analytics), which may not yet be advanced enough to position you as a full-fledged data analyst.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Roles/Titles to Target**\nTaking all this into account, I believe your ideal opportunities lie at the intersection of operations, strategy, and analytics, where your experience can shine without overextending into areas that might not align fully with your background.\n\n#### **Top Roles to Target:**\n1. **Revenue Operations Manager/Director**\n   - Why: Your process optimization, CRM buildout, and operational strategy experience align perfectly. This role doesn\u2019t require full-time sales enablement experience but values knowledge of sales workflows and analytics.\n\n2. **E-Commerce Operations Manager/Director**\n   - Why: Your proven ability to scale e-commerce businesses (OJCommerce, Mirakl) and streamline operational workflows makes this a natural fit. These roles often value cross-functional collaboration, which you\u2019ve done extensively.\n\n3. **Business Operations Manager/Director**\n   - Why: These roles focus on strategic planning, process improvements, and driving operational efficiencies across departments. Your experience at Pollen, CommerceHub, and OJCommerce demonstrates your strength here.\n\n4. **Strategic Project Manager/Program Manager**\n   - Why: Your ability to lead cross-functional projects, such as Mirakl\u2019s $100M strategic initiative, aligns with the requirements of this role. It allows you to leverage your organizational and leadership skills.\n\n5. **Analytics-Driven Operations Roles**\n   - Titles: Business Intelligence Analyst, Revenue Operations Analyst, or Strategy Analyst.\n   - Why: While these roles may be more entry-level, they can leverage your recent analytics training and allow you to transition into the analytics space over time.\n\n---\n\n### **LinkedIn Profile Optimization Plan**\nIf these roles resonate, your LinkedIn profile should emphasize:\n1. **Operational Strategy**: Highlight your ability to lead cross-functional initiatives, optimize workflows, and scale operations (e.g., CRM, vendor onboarding).\n2. **E-commerce Expertise**: Showcase your experience growing e-commerce platforms and managing marketplaces.\n3. **Analytics-Driven Decision Making**: Position your recent upskilling as part of your growth into roles that integrate analytics with strategy.\n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019d approach key sections:\n- **Headline**: Focus on operations and e-commerce expertise while touching on analytics.\n   - *Example*: *Strategic Operations & E-Commerce Leader | Scaling Businesses with Data-Driven Insights & Process Optimization*\n- **About Section**:\n   > I\u2019m an operations and e-commerce leader with 10+ years of experience driving revenue growth and operational excellence. From scaling OJCommerce\u2019s revenue from $30M to $100M in three years to leading Mirakl\u2019s $100M GTM strategy, I specialize in streamlining workflows, optimizing processes, and leveraging data to unlock growth opportunities. Recently, I\u2019ve completed the Google Data Analytics Certification to expand my ability to derive actionable insights and support business strategy with data. I\u2019m excited to bring my skills in strategic operations, e-commerce, and analytics to my next role.\n- **Experience Section**: Revise to align with the operational focus above, pulling sales enablement and partnerships into supporting roles without overemphasis.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Job Search Focus**:\n   - Look for roles in **Revenue Operations**, **E-Commerce Operations**, or **Business Operations**.  \n   - Prioritize companies in SaaS, e-commerce, or tech, as they\u2019ll value your combined operational and analytics experience.\n\n2. **LinkedIn Actions**:\n   - Update your profile as outlined above.\n   - Reactivate your network: Post an update about your career goals (e.g., pivoting into operations and analytics roles) and reach out to connections.\n\n3. **Applications**:\n   - Tailor your resume for each application, ensuring alignment with the role\u2019s requirements.\n   - Use LinkedIn Premium to identify and contact hiring managers/recruiters directly.\n\n4. **Analytics Portfolio**:\n   - Complete at least one portfolio project and link it on your LinkedIn profile to demonstrate your analytics capability.\n\n5. **Networking**:\n   - Focus on warm introductions for roles in your target areas.\n   - Attend virtual or local events for e-commerce and operations professionals to expand your network.\n\nWould you like help drafting a LinkedIn post, networking message, or refining this plan further?"
