    "Your current industry selection, **\"Technology, Information, and Internet,\"** aligns well with SaaS and e-commerce roles, but it may be worth exploring a more tailored option depending on the primary focus of the roles you\u2019re targeting.\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **\"Computer Software\"**: A highly relevant choice for SaaS companies, which frequently use this category.\n2. **\"Internet\"**: Broader and suitable for roles that touch on marketplaces or e-commerce.\n3. **\"E-commerce\"**: Directly aligns with your experience in marketplace and drop ship operations.\n4. **\"Information Technology and Services\"**: A solid catch-all for tech-related roles but might feel less specialized.\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf your primary focus is on SaaS and operational leadership roles:\n**Change to \"Computer Software.\"**\n\nIf you\u2019re leaning more into e-commerce roles:\n**Change to \"E-commerce.\"**\n\nWould you like to switch to one of these, or do you want to keep the current category?"
