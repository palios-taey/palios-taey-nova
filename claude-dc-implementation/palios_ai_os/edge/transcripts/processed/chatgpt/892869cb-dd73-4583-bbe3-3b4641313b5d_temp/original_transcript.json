    "So we have a lot of different work streams. My feeling (and that might just be a feeling) is that you lose site of some of that once we get on something. For example, that was absent from your plan until Tuesday that you submitted before this. I really looking for you to keep everything we've discussed from a strategic perspective in mind. So that includes, Chewy, automation of social or tools for followers, posting, linkedin virality, outreach, job search outreach automation, X, everything. I think what worked well was just 1 thing at a time rather than a plan, so what the next most important thing to do right now in next 1 hour?"
