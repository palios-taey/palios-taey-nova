    "Got it\u2014let\u2019s keep pushing forward on outreach. **Next up: Rick Watson.**  \n\nHere\u2019s a draft tailored for him:  \n\n---\n\n### **Subject:** Need your take on something big I\u2019m doing  \n\nHey Rick, hope you\u2019re doing well!  \n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to take a big swing\u2014and I\u2019d really appreciate your thoughts.  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for 2 years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is turning the job market upside down, and the traditional playbook just isn\u2019t working.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m taking a completely different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my **AI-powered career transformation experiment**\u2014documenting how I\u2019m using AI to rethink job searching, automation, and income creation.  \n\nI know you\u2019ve got deep expertise in e-commerce and tech, and I\u2019d love your perspective on this shift. A **reshare or comment** would also mean a ton in helping me get this in front of the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014would love for you to check it out and let me know what you think.  \n\nReally appreciate it, Rick. Thanks!  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Approach?**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Acknowledges his expertise** \u2192 Makes him feel valued and relevant to the discussion.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Keeps it concise** \u2192 Gets straight to the point without over-explaining.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Has a clear CTA** \u2192 Asks for a reshare or comment, but also invites him to engage intellectually.  \n\nLet me know if you want any tweaks before sending! If it looks good, we\u2019ll move on to the next."
