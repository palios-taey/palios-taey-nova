    "Ok, before we move to next one, let's talk about PKD quick. We've talked about this as a place to store overrides, but we also need a place to store just information about me, my thinking process, skills, background, beliefs, etc to help frame how you guide me. Does the existing structure allow for this, or do we need to take another look. Making a map of my mind is important for singularity and there is so much data we have on that from our chats that I want stored and the ability to input more memories and thoughts. This will also allow you to challenge them and force critical thinking when we diverge."
