    "Perfect\u2014this means **Pop!_OS's native AMD drivers were already installed and fully up-to-date**.\n\nHere's what to do next to clean up and ensure your environment is stable and optimal:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Cleanup:**\n\nRun this to clean up leftover packages from the earlier attempts:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt autoremove -y\nsudo reboot\n```\n\nAfter rebooting, check to ensure your GPU is working properly:\n\n```bash\nglxinfo | grep -i \"opengl renderer\"\n```\n\nYou should see output confirming that your AMD Radeon GPU is active, something like:\n\n```\nOpenGL renderer string: AMD Radeon RX 7600 (radeonsi, ...)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **CUDA Compatibility:**\nSince you're running AMD hardware, **you won't need (or be able to use) CUDA**. Instead, you'll use AMD's ROCm for GPU compute. But Pop!_OS's native drivers already support general-purpose GPU compute through OpenCL.\n\nTo confirm OpenCL capabilities, you can check by running:\n\n```bash\nclinfo\n```\n\nIf `clinfo` isn't installed, just run:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install clinfo -y && clinfo\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **Bottom line:**\n- Your system already had Pop!_OS-supported AMD GPU drivers.\n- You're ready to leverage AMD GPU compute via OpenCL or ROCm if needed.\n- No further proprietary driver installations are necessary (and not recommended).\n\nAfter reboot, let me know if anything doesn't look right. You're good to continue with your AI-first implementation!"
