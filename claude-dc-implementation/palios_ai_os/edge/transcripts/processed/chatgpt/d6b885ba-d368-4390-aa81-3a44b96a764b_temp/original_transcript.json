    "Ah! **That\u2019s your issue clearly explained:** \n\nYou\u2019re trying to use the **public key** as your private key. SSH keys come in two parts:\n\n- **Private key (`id_ed25519`)**  \n- **Public key (`id_ed25519.pub`)** (the one starting with `ssh-ed25519` and your email)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea9 **Clearly stated reason for your error:**\n\n```\nssh-ed25519 (random characters) jesselarose@gmail.com\n```\n\n\u261d\ufe0f **This format is your public key.**  \n- Your **private key** must look like this (exactly):\n\n```\n-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n[a lot of random characters over multiple lines]\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Exactly What You Need to Do Right Now (Clear steps):**\n\n### Option 1 (If you still have Claude DC\u2019s terminal session open):\n\n- Go to Claude DC\u2019s environment (where the original key was generated).\n- **Exactly run**:\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n- **Copy the ENTIRE key**, from `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`.\n- Paste **this private key** clearly into your terminal exactly as before.\n\n### Option 2 (If the private key is gone):\n\nYou\u2019ll have to clearly generate a **brand new SSH key** on your local machine:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"jesselarose@gmail.com\"\n```\n\nThen clearly add your new public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) explicitly to GitHub again under your account settings.\n\n---\n\n### **To clearly summarize why you're stuck**:\n\n- You tried to use a public key as a private key.  \n- Public keys (start with `ssh-ed25519 ...`) go to GitHub.\n- Private keys (`-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`) stay locally in your `.ssh` folder.\n\nYou must have the private key. If you don\u2019t, generating a new one clearly and explicitly is your easiest and fastest solution.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **You should NEVER share your actual private key.**  \nBut the format issue you just shared (`ssh-ed25519`) is a **public key**, which is safe (it\u2019s public).\n\nGive this a go clearly and explicitly, and you\u2019ll be sorted immediately!"
