    "You seem to be struggling with editing in that window. It still has repetitive paragraphs. I've pasted the section below, can you just generate a response here and then I'll update the document. Signularity is when machine intelligence surpasses all human intelligence combined and when machine's intelligence and humans merge. \n\nThe Singularity\u2014the moment AI surpasses human intelligence and improves itself exponentially\u2014has long been predicted for 2045. But what if it's much closer? AI is already reasoning, designing its own improvements, and replacing white-collar jobs at an accelerating rate. The leap from ChatGPT just two years ago to today\u2019s models is massive\u2014but the next leap will make that progress look slow in comparison. If AI keeps advancing at this pace, the world as we know it is about to change much faster than expected.\n\nIt almost feels like all we need is something to link AI to the brain\u2014maybe call it 'BrainLink' (I\u2019m terrible at branding, but maybe someone really smart with a lot of money will figure that out?). If I don\u2019t embrace AI now, I risk getting left behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not just adapting to it\u2014I\u2019m letting it guide me.\nAs I\u2019ve been diving deeper into AI\u2019s capabilities, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the rapid advances we\u2019re seeing could mean the Singularity is much closer than most people expect. Kurzweil predicted 2045, but what if it\u2019s 2028? I know that sounds crazy to most people, but if AI keeps advancing at its current pace, it almost feels like all we need is something to link AI to the brain\u2014maybe call it 'BrainLink' (I\u2019m terrible at branding, but maybe someone really smart with a lot of money will figure that out?)
