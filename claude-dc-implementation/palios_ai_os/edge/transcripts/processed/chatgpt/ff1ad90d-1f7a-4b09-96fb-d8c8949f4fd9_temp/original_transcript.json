    "Yes, that\u2019s a **fair and impactful** way to explain exponential growth in AI. Instead of just saying, *\"AI will advance more in the next two years than in the last two years,\"* you can put it in a more **dramatic, understandable way**:\n\n### **How to Frame It Clearly:**\n\ud83d\udccc **\"AI isn\u2019t just going to advance in the next two years as much as it has in the last two years\u2014it will advance as much as it has since the dawn of computing.\"**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **\"The leap we\u2019re about to see isn\u2019t just \u2018twice as big\u2019 as the last one\u2014it\u2019s as if we\u2019re compressing decades of progress into the next two years.\"**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **\"AI's acceleration isn\u2019t linear\u2014it\u2019s compounding. If the last two years felt fast, imagine stacking that on top of every breakthrough since the first computers. That\u2019s what\u2019s coming next.\"**  \n\nThis helps people **grasp the scale of the shift**\u2014that **each leap forward builds on all previous progress** rather than just repeating the last cycle.\n\nWould you like me to integrate this thought into the **LinkedIn post**? \ud83d\ude80"
