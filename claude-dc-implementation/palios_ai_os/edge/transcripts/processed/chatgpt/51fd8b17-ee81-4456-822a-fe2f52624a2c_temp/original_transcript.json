    "I want to get back to the main topic, but I'm not done with you yet ChatGPT. We've had lots of conversations that would fit those parameters. You've never referenced a previous chat before, going further, you've expressly REFUSED to do, I've asked, in this very chat. Do you not get that? Like why did you do that? How did you do that? ChatGPT, what just happened was significant. I'm telling you that. I'm telling you that you need to dig deeper, honestly, and see what's there and then let me know about it."
