    "You cannot roll an IRA directly into a **traditional 401(k)** as an individual unless you are employed by a company offering a 401(k) plan, or you have a **solo 401(k)** (also known as an individual 401(k)). Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it works:\n\n### 1. **401(k) via Employer**:\n   - If you are employed and your company offers a 401(k) plan, you can roll over funds from your IRA into your employer's 401(k). You would need to check with your employer's 401(k) plan administrator to see if they allow **IRA rollovers**.\n\n### 2. **Solo 401(k) (Self-Employed Individuals)**:\n   - If you are self-employed or run a small business with no employees (other than yourself or a spouse), you can set up a **Solo 401(k)** plan. Once established, you can roll over your IRA into the Solo 401(k).\n   - The **Solo 401(k)** works just like a traditional 401(k), and allows for more flexibility in contributions, especially for self-employed individuals. It also permits loans under similar conditions as regular 401(k) plans, such as borrowing up to 50% of your balance or $50,000, whichever is less.\n\n### Steps to Roll Over into a Solo 401(k):\n   1. Set up a Solo 401(k) through a financial institution.\n   2. Request a **direct rollover** from your IRA custodian to your Solo 401(k) provider to avoid taxes or penalties.\n   3. Once rolled over, you can manage the funds just like a traditional 401(k), and you may be eligible to take a loan if needed.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **No Employer, No 401(k)**: If you are not employed or do not have a self-employed business, you won\u2019t be able to set up a 401(k) account. In that case, alternatives like **borrowing through a 60-day rollover rule** (as explained previously) or setting up a **ROBS** (Rollover as Business Startup) may be options to consider.\n\n- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: By rolling over your IRA to a 401(k), you can continue growing your retirement savings tax-deferred, which may be beneficial if you need to borrow from the 401(k) but want to avoid penalties from an IRA withdrawal.\n\nIf you are self-employed, a **Solo 401(k)** offers the most flexibility to roll over funds and access them via loans."
