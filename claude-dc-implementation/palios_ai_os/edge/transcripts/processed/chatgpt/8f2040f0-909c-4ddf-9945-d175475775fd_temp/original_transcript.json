    "Understood. I will conduct a thorough review of all prior attachments and align the **Personal Knowledge Database (PKD)** structure to match what was mutually agreed upon. I'll also ensure all required fields are clearly indicated for data integrity.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n1. **Verify Column Completeness** \u2013 Ensure every agreed-upon column exists and is correctly formatted.\n2. **Mark Required Fields** \u2013 Identify which fields must always have a value for proper data integrity.\n3. **Validate Relations** \u2013 Ensure all relationships are properly configured to connect with relevant tables.\n4. **Re-submit Updated PKD Structure** \u2013 Provide a final screenshot or list of any updates needed before entering more sample data.\n\nI'll now review and finalize. Stay tuned for the structured updates."
