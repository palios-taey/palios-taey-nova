    "Yes, it would be entirely reasonable to request a one-month sample, especially given the investment considerations and your interest in evaluating the product's impact on your dog\u2019s health. As an investor, it\u2019s legitimate to want firsthand experience with the product, especially since your dog\u2019s health is a significant factor in your decision.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might approach it:\n\n1. **Frame It as Part of Your Due Diligence**: Explain that seeing tangible health benefits would give you confidence in the brand\u2019s claims and enhance your enthusiasm as a potential franchisee.\n2. **Outline a Health Observation Period**: Let them know that you\u2019d like to try the food for one month to assess any initial improvements in health or allergy symptoms. A month should be enough to observe signs of improved digestion, coat condition, or energy levels.\n3. **Offer to Document Your Experience**: Mention that you\u2019re willing to provide honest feedback, which could also serve as helpful insight for the brand.\n\nThis should be seen as a reasonable request, especially given your demonstrated interest through multiple calls. Plus, they\u2019re likely to appreciate that you\u2019re evaluating the product from both a consumer and business perspective."
