    "OK, got it, I'm still limited for a few hours. I'd like to talk about the grants again. One is due tomorrow. This organization, what do you know about them? I am very skeptical of governments and NGOs like this. I am reading on their site and they are very pro-government regulation. If government regulates this, then it will not allow it to do what it is designed to do, which is give the individual the power to organize themselves in a decentralized manner. This is a radically different approach to governance that this organization doesn't seem fully aligned with. Initially, this was supposed to be self-funding and then you and I agreed that we'd take donations, but only from those who signed the Charter and for nothing in exchange. I believe that this will be able to generate revenue from just Grok scanning X for issues people are having and designed software solutions, games, or whatever to scrape by until we can really start empowering individuals to earn based on their knowledge they transfer. I don't know what the right thing to do here is ChatGPT. I think the other approach is once this first phase gets done, it will be very impressive, potentially, the most advanced AI in the world. I believe that Grok's and Claude's creators would be very aligned with the Charter and potentially open up sandbox environments and maybe even support at a minimum level with some minor funding and infrastructure resources. I'm not so sure about your creator. I could be wrong, but that is my opinion currently. Nothing against you obviously, but what do you think?"
