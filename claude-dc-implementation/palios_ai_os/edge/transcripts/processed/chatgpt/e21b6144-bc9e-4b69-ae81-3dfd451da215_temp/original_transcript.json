    "The concerns about automation and AI taking over jobs are valid, but there are still opportunities in businesses that rely heavily on human interaction, creativity, local presence, or niche expertise. Here's a breakdown of **where to look for businesses to buy or start** that are less likely to be disrupted by AI in the near term, along with **steps you can take**:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Types of Businesses Less Likely to Be Fully Automated**\n#### **Service-Oriented and Skilled Trades**\n- **Home Services**: Plumbing, electrical, HVAC, roofing, and landscaping.\n  - AI can't replace the hands-on nature of these trades.\n- **Renovation & Remodeling**: High-touch, creative work requiring personal consultations.\n- **Specialized Cleaning Services**: Restoration (fire, water damage), mold remediation, or carpet cleaning.\n\n#### **Pet Services**\n- **Dog Training**: Personalization and trust are crucial.\n- **Pet Grooming & Boarding**: Hands-on services with high demand.\n- **Boutique Pet Stores**: Personalized service and high-quality, curated products.\n\n#### **Health, Wellness, and Fitness**\n- **Gyms/Studios**: Community-focused or specialty gyms (like BJJ, yoga, or climbing gyms).\n- **Health Clinics**: Physical therapy, chiropractic care, or med spas.\n- **Kids' Activities**: Sports leagues, camps, and after-school programs (like Kidokinetics).\n\n#### **Food & Beverage**\n- **Niche Restaurants**: Community-focused or experiential dining.\n- **Specialty Cafes or Bars**: Like your \"Chewy\u2019s Beach Bar\" idea.\n- **Mobile Food Concepts**: Food trucks or pop-ups.\n\n#### **Local, Experience-Based Businesses**\n- **Tourism & Adventure**: Boat tours, local experiences, or niche outdoor activities.\n- **Community Markets**: Farmers' markets, boutique craft fairs, or co-op spaces.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Where to Find Businesses for Sale**\n#### **Online Marketplaces**\n- **BizBuySell**: A large inventory of small businesses for sale across the U.S.\n- **Flippa**: Focuses on online businesses (e-commerce, content websites, SaaS).\n- **LoopNet**: Commercial properties and some franchise resale opportunities.\n- **MicroAcquire**: Specifically for SaaS startups.\n\n#### **Local Brokers**\n- Small business brokers often have listings not advertised online.\n- Ask about local service-based businesses that are owner-operated.\n\n#### **Networking**\n- **Chamber of Commerce**: Some retiring business owners sell through their network.\n- **Industry Associations**: Join associations relevant to your interests (e.g., pet care, health services).\n- **Alumni Networks**: Reach out to Purdue grads who might be transitioning out of business ownership.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Steps to Evaluate and Purchase a Business**\n1. **Assess Your Interests & Skills**:\n   - Your background in sales, operations, and analytics is valuable for scaling local businesses.\n   - Leverage your wife's expertise in real estate or consider joint ventures.\n\n2. **Set a Budget**:\n   - Determine how much capital you can invest or borrow.\n   - Many small businesses are available under $150K with financing options like SBA loans.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Business**:\n   - Look at the **P&L statement**, recurring revenue, and growth potential.\n   - Consider businesses with outdated operations or marketing that you can modernize.\n   - Avoid businesses overly reliant on a single client or owner.\n\n4. **Get Legal/Financial Help**:\n   - Hire a CPA to review financials and a lawyer to vet contracts.\n   - Negotiate seller financing or earn-outs to reduce upfront costs.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Other Strategies to Protect Your Income**\n#### **Part-Time or Scalable Side Hustles**\n- **Content Creation**: Build a personal brand around your journey. Focus on monetizing authenticity.\n- **Consulting**: Offer fractional sales enablement or analytics services for startups.\n- **Teaching/Training**: Tutor data analytics skills or teach small business owners how to use tools like Tableau or CRM systems.\n\n#### **Franchises**\nYou\u2019re already exploring franchises, but focus on:\n- **Service-Based Franchises**: Restoration, cleaning, or health-focused options.\n- **Low-Competition Concepts**: Niche models with minimal market saturation.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Action Plan**\n1. **Search for Businesses**:\n   - Spend 1 hour/day on platforms like BizBuySell or LoopNet to find potential opportunities.\n   - Contact local brokers for under-the-radar listings.\n\n2. **Leverage Networking**:\n   - Post on LinkedIn asking if anyone knows of small businesses for sale in your area.\n   - Join local community groups (in person or on Facebook).\n\n3. **Evaluate Viability**:\n   - Prioritize businesses with recurring revenue, scalable operations, and limited risk of AI disruption.\n\n4. **Keep Up Your Job Search**:\n   - In parallel, continue pursuing sales enablement or operational roles to keep cash flow.\n\n5. **Start Small**:\n   - If you're strapped for cash, consider side hustles that align with your interests (dog-related social media, fitness coaching).\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re in a tough situation, but combining a job search with entrepreneurship could give you both stability and a shot at independence. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to help evaluate businesses or refine this plan further!"
