    "You're in good shape! Let's clearly and safely resolve this. \n\n**Current Status:**\n\n- Your system has partial CUDA and NVIDIA packages installed (but no actual driver yet).\n- You have the System76 CUDA toolkit (version 11.2) and manually installed NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (version 11.5).  \n- You do not currently have a proper NVIDIA GPU driver installed yet, causing the dependency conflict.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **Recommended Quick & Safe Resolution:**\n\nYou should do the following quick steps to fully clean out conflicts and install a consistent System76 recommended Nvidia/CUDA setup:\n\n**Step 1: Clean up conflicting packages:**\n\n```bash\nsudo apt purge '*nvidia*' '*cuda*'\nsudo apt autoremove\nsudo apt clean\n```\n\n_(This removes partial/conflicting NVIDIA and CUDA installations.)_\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Install Pop!_OS Recommended Drivers & CUDA:**\n\nThis will install a consistent, tested NVIDIA driver + CUDA setup for Pop!_OS:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia system76-cuda-latest\n```\n\n- Pop!_OS automatically manages NVIDIA/CUDA compatibility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Reboot to load Nvidia drivers properly:**\n\n```bash\nsudo reboot\n```\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Verify your installation after reboot:**\n\nRun these commands to confirm CUDA and Nvidia GPU are active:\n\n```bash\nnvidia-smi\nnvcc --version\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **What about the \"Possible missing firmware...\" warnings?**\n\nYou can safely ignore these unless you're using an AMD GPU. They are just warnings about missing AMD GPU firmware (unrelated to Nvidia/CUDA).\n\nIf you don't have an AMD GPU, just ignore these warnings completely. They're harmless.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Why this approach?**\n\n- Clears partial/conflicting installations.\n- Ensures a consistent Pop!_OS system optimized setup.\n- Safest and simplest path to reliable GPU acceleration.\n\n---\n\nPlease run **Step 1 \u2192 Step 4**, and your setup will be properly configured and clean!"
