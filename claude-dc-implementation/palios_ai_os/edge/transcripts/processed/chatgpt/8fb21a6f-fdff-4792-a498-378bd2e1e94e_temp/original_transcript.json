    "You definitely don't want to install the toolkit and drivers separately like that\u2014it's cumbersome and prone to mismatches.\n\n**On Pop!_OS,** there's a much simpler and safer way:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **System76 Pop!_OS Recommended Method (Easy & Clean):**\n\nPop!_OS provides an integrated, optimized NVIDIA driver stack through their repositories. Here's the recommended quick & easy setup:\n\n### Step 1: **Install NVIDIA Drivers & CUDA (one simple command)**\n\nRun the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia system76-cuda-latest\n```\n\nThis automatically installs the correct NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit specifically optimized by System76 for your machine.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Reboot your machine**\n\nAfter the installation completes, reboot your computer to activate the new drivers:\n\n```bash\nsudo reboot\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Verify NVIDIA driver and CUDA are working**\n\nOnce you're back, verify your installation by running:\n\n```bash\nnvidia-smi\nnvcc --version\n```\n\nThese commands should clearly show your GPU and CUDA version.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Important Note:**\n\nIf you've already run `sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`, let's first clean it up to prevent conflicts:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt remove --purge nvidia-cuda-toolkit\nsudo apt autoremove\n```\n\nThen perform Step 1 (System76 recommended way).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Why This Way is Better:**\n\n- Pop!_OS is optimized specifically for System76 hardware.\n- All dependencies & versions are automatically aligned.\n- Reduces manual configuration and troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom line:**\n- Execute the System76-specific commands above.  \n- Reboot.\n- Verify with `nvidia-smi`.\n\nThis is the fastest, easiest, and cleanest way for your Mira System76 setup to leverage CUDA GPU acceleration."
