    "I agree\u2014broad, open-ended questions often get ignored, especially by execs with limited time. Your approach is much better\u2014it\u2019s specific, relevant to your experiment, and easy to respond to. Here\u2019s a refined version that keeps it **short, intriguing, and easy to answer:**  \n\n---\n\n**Hi Shri,**  \n\nAppreciate the connection! I\u2019m testing something new\u2014an **AI-powered job search experiment** where resumes prioritize **how AI can eliminate or minimize the role instead of traditional skills/experience.**  \n\nAs someone driving AI adoption at scale, **would that intrigue you as a hiring leader, or does it seem too disruptive?**  \n\n---\n\n### **Why this works:**  \n\u2714 **Directly tied to your experiment** (not a generic AI question).  \n\u2714 **Quick to respond to** (just asks for an opinion\u2014yes/no + short reasoning).  \n\u2714 **Sparks curiosity** (AI eliminating roles is bold\u2014she may have an immediate reaction).  \n\u2714 **Keeps it business-relevant** without feeling like a cold pitch.  \n\nLet me know if you want to tweak anything, but this should have a **higher chance of engagement** than a long theoretical question. \ud83d\ude80"
