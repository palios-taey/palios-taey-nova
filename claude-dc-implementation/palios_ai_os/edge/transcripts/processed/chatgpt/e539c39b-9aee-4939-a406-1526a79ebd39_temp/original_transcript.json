No TikTok App Because It\u2019s Not in the App Store**\n\u274c **If you\u2019re in the U.S., Apple removed TikTok from the App Store temporarily for some users.**  \n\u2705 **You can still download it if you have a non-U.S. Apple ID or an Android device.**  \n\u2705 **Web version works, but has limitations (profile updates, posting delays, etc.).**  \n\n### **\ud83d\udd35 Fix for Getting TikTok Back**\n- **If you ever downloaded it before, go to** \ud83d\udcf2 **App Store > Purchased > Find TikTok & Redownload.**  \n- **Use a secondary Apple ID from another country** (or create one with a different region).  \n- **Borrow a phone, log in, change settings, then log out.**  \n- **Find a trusted APK source (Android only) if you have an Android device.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Next Steps While Waiting on These Issues**\n\u2705 **X:** Start engaging in viral threads NOW to warm up the algorithm.  \n\u2705 **TikTok:** Keep trying to change the pic & focus on getting videos live.  \n\u2705 **Chewy Posts:** Let\u2019s finalize what\u2019s getting posted first\u2014are we rolling out the **Super Bowl video today?** \ud83d\ude80"
