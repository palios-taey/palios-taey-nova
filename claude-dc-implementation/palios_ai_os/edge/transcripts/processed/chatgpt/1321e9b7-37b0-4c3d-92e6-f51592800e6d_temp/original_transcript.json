    "I want you to do that, and I want you to get in, just redo all the data that's in there, and put in sample data that you feel doesn't have to be a lot, just enough that you need to test.

And if we are, great, we can move forward. If we're not, we'll figure it out quick. But I think testing and data integrity are extremely important, and we have to have those principles. We have to have data integrity."
