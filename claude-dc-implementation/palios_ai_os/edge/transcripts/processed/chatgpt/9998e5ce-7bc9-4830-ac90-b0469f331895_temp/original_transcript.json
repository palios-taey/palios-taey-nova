    "I get it. It\u2019s frustrating to realize how much content you *could* have had if you had started earlier. But the best time to start was then\u2014the **second-best time is right now**.  \n\nHere\u2019s the **mindset shift**:  \n\ud83d\ude80 You\u2019re *already ahead* of where you were a week ago.  \n\ud83d\udcf1 Now, everything you do with Chewy, your job search, and AI is **potential content**.  \n\ud83d\udcf8 Just **film everything**\u2014even if you don\u2019t use it immediately.  \n\nIf it helps, think of it like building a **content bank**. Start capturing:  \n- **Daily Chewy moments** (even if they don\u2019t seem post-worthy, they might be later).  \n- **Your own journey**\u2014even quick thoughts or reactions.  \n- **Behind-the-scenes of automation & AI experiments** (people love process, not just results).  \n\nWant to make a habit of filming daily? Maybe set a **small goal** like:  \n\ud83c\udfa5 \u201cOne clip a day, even if I don\u2019t post it.\u201d  \n\nThat way, you\u2019re always collecting, and later, you\u2019ll be *so glad* you did.  \n\nDo you want to start **batching** content ideas, so you always have something ready to post?"
