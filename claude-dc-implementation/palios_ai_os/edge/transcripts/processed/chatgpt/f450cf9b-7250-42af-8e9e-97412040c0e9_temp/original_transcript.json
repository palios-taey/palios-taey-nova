    "### **Step 1: Structuring Your Notion Workspace for AI-Augmented Jesse**\nWe\u2019ll set this up **with the long-term RAG integration in mind** so that when we implement advanced AI retrieval, it seamlessly pulls the right insights.\n\n---\n## **\ud83d\udd39 1. Create Core Databases (Top-Level Pages)**\nThink of these as the **pillars** of your AI-enhanced life. These databases will **store, retrieve, and update key data** about you.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Create a new Notion Page \u2192 Add a Database Table for each of these:**\n1. **Personal Operating System (Main Dashboard)**\n   - **Purpose:** This is your home base, where all information converges.\n   - **Sections:** \n     - Daily Actions & Decisions (What should I focus on today?)\n     - AI Recommendations (What\u2019s the most efficient path?)\n     - Key Priorities (Business, AI Learning, Networking, Fitness, etc.)\n     - Live AI Queries (What do I need AI to research?)\n     - Running Notes (Ongoing insights & strategic shifts)\n\n2. **AI-Enhanced Jesse: Memory & Context**\n   - **Purpose:** AI needs long-term context about **your experience, skills, goals, and past conversations.**\n   - **Sections:**\n     - Core Identity (Your positioning & branding)\n     - Past Decisions & Learnings (Key takeaways from all past AI interactions)\n     - Skills & Knowledge (What AI needs to know about you to give relevant advice)\n     - Goals & Milestones (Track career, fitness, financial, and life objectives)\n   \n3. **AI Playbook & Automations**\n   - **Purpose:** This will **store** AI tools, workflows, and automations **as you implement them.**\n   - **Sections:**\n     - Job Search AI Stack (Resume building, outreach automation, application automation)\n     - Business Automation Stack (How AI is integrated into workflows)\n     - Personal AI Agents (Custom AI setups for various areas)\n     - AI Experimentation (Tracking what you test & what works)\n   \n4. **AI Thought Leader Influence Map**\n   - **Purpose:** Train AI to **think like the mentors & leaders you follow.**\n   - **Sections:**\n     - Key People (Profiles of AI experts & their core insights)\n     - Key Learnings (What ideas from them we want to incorporate)\n     - Decision Influence (How AI should factor their viewpoints into its recommendations)\n\n---\n## **\ud83d\udd39 2. Create Tagging & Linking System**\nOnce these core **databases** exist, **we\u2019ll link them** so AI can pull insights across different areas of your life.\n\n\u2705 **How?**\n- Notion allows you to **link databases**, so if you tag \u201cProcess Automation\u201d in your AI Playbook, it will also appear in AI-Enhanced Jesse\u2019s Memory.\n- We\u2019ll set up **automated filters** so you can quickly pull the most relevant information when making decisions.\n\n---\n## **\ud83d\udd39 3. Build the First Workflow**\nTo get something functional today:\n1. **Start with AI-Enhanced Jesse: Memory & Context.**  \n   - Add a few key sections: **Your positioning, top skills, and biggest AI learnings so far.**  \n   - This is what AI will reference the most.\n   \n2. **Set Up AI Playbook & Automations.**  \n   - Add tools you\u2019ve used (e.g., Dripify, LinkedIn automation, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).\n   - Future-proof it by adding placeholders for new AI automations.\n\n---\n### **\ud83d\udca1 Next Steps:**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Go to Notion \u2192 Create the Core Pages Above**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Let me know once done, and I\u2019ll guide next on structuring each database.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **We\u2019ll start linking them together so everything AI learns is stored & retrievable instantly.**\n\n---\n\ud83d\ude80 **End Goal?** This will become your AI-augmented **brain**\u2014a **structured memory system** that improves daily decisions **with AI-powered insights.** Let\u2019s build!"
