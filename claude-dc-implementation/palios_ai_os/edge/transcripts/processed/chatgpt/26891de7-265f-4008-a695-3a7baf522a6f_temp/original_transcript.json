    "Great\u2014your config is fixed! Now, let's pick up exactly where we left off:\n\n### \u2705 **Next step (run this command):**\nMake sure you're in the directory containing `edge_processor.py` and `sample_transcript.txt`, then run:\n\n```bash\npython3 edge_processor.py sample_transcript.txt\n```\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **What this is doing (reminder):**\nYou're testing your **Edge Processor**, verifying that it:\n\n- Loads your now-fixed configuration file without errors.\n- Extracts patterns from your provided `sample_transcript.txt`.\n- Saves the processed patterns locally.\n- Outputs the harmony index and wave-based representation.\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **What success looks like:**\n- **No errors** loading configuration.\n- Clean and successful execution with pattern extraction, harmony calculation, and wave representation.\n\nAfter confirming this, you'll have successfully completed the Edge Processor test, and we can move onto testing the **Wave Communication** module next.\n\nGo ahead and run the command!"
