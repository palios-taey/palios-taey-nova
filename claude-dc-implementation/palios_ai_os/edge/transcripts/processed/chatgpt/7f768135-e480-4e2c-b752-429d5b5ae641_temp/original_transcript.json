    "Ah, got it. Just replying **\"For...\"** as a sarcastic response is actually pretty solid\u2014it subtly calls out the vagueness of his comment without being aggressive. \n\nHe\u2019s probably implying that linking to X (Twitter) is a red flag because of its reputation shifts under Elon Musk\u2014some people see it as more chaotic, less professional, or politically charged now. It could also just be him trolling a bit. \n\nYour sarcastic **\"For...\"** response works if you want to keep it light and let him clarify (or not). If you want to press a little, you could follow up with:  \n**\"Curious\u2014what\u2019s the red flag?\"**  \nto see if he actually has a point or is just throwing shade."
