    "Let\u2019s focus on **maximizing LinkedIn virality prep** since that\u2019s the core launch.\n\n### Next Immediate Steps (4:37 PM ET - Evening)\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Finish High-Value Outreach** \u2013 We\u2019ve hit key names, but we should still message the next tier (recruiters, key connections, active engagers).\n   - **Tactic:** Use Drippy or manual outreach to cover these efficiently. Are you set up on Drippy, or do we need to figure that out?\n   - **Target:** Recruiters you\u2019ve engaged with in the last 2 years + past colleagues.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Draft Response Templates for Engagement** \u2013 \n   - **Tactic:** Prewrite some responses for engagement once the post goes live so you can be lightning-fast. The goal is to **boost early engagement** with quick replies.\n   - **Example:** \u201cThanks for the support, really appreciate it! What\u2019s your take on how AI is shifting things in your industry?\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Prepare \u201cFirst Comment\u201d Strategy** \u2013  \n   - **Tactic:** We need a **high-value** first comment to drive conversation and boost reach.\n   - **Options:** \n     - Expansion on AI career automation\n     - Additional context on Chewy\n     - \"Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned so far\" to set up a follow-up post.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Plan Your LinkedIn Groups Strategy** \u2013  \n   - **Tactic:** Identify the **top 3-5 LinkedIn groups** where a modified version of your post will perform well. Purdue, Sigma Chi, etc.\n   - Need to prep those posts so they don\u2019t seem copy-paste spam.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **X Cross-Promotion Plan** \u2013  \n   - **Tactic:** Figure out **the best way to drive LinkedIn traffic to X**. This could be in:\n     - The LinkedIn first comment\n     - A follow-up post on X linking to LinkedIn\n     - A direct CTA in the LinkedIn post.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **What do you want to hit first?** My suggestion: **Drippy setup if it saves time on outreach, otherwise manual message the next tier while I draft response/comment strategies.**"
