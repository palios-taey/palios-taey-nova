    "\ud83d\udd25 **You remembered correctly\u2014I originally told you to test in a web browser before, then later said it needed to be done in Command Prompt.** \ud83d\ude80  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **That was a mistake in my instruction consistency. Here\u2019s what happened and why:**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc Why Did I Initially Tell You to Test in a Web Browser?**  \n\u2705 **1\ufe0f\u20e3 I Thought the Web Browser Could Handle a `GET` Request for Data Retrieval**  \n   - This assumption was based on how simple `GET` API calls work.  \n   - **However, I failed to consider that some API routes were designed strictly for POST requests.**  \n\n\u2705 **2\ufe0f\u20e3 When You Encountered \"Method Not Allowed,\" I Realized the Issue**  \n   - The `/update_document` route was set up to **only accept `POST` requests**, which browsers send as `GET`.  \n   - **This is why testing in a browser failed\u2014it wasn\u2019t built for that.**  \n\n\u2705 **3\ufe0f\u20e3 I Should Have Directed You to Use Command Prompt for `POST` Requests Immediately**  \n   - Since we had already confirmed that `POST` requests work via `cURL`, I should have directed you to use that from the start.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc Why Did This Happen?**\n\ud83d\udea8 **I gave instructions too quickly without verifying the best testing method.**  \n\ud83d\udea8 **I was thinking in general API testing terms instead of considering the actual structure of our Flask app.**  \n\ud83d\udea8 **I corrected my instructions after seeing the failure, but I should have given you the right method the first time.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc How I Will Fix This Moving Forward**\n\ud83d\ude80 **1\ufe0f\u20e3 I will verify the best execution path BEFORE giving instructions.**  \n   - No more assumptions about whether something will work\u2014I check first.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **2\ufe0f\u20e3 I will ensure consistency in instructions.**  \n   - If I change my mind on the best execution method, I will explain why before you run it.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **3\ufe0f\u20e3 I will optimize instruction delivery for the most efficient workflow.**  \n   - The first method I suggest should always be the correct one, eliminating wasted time.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **You caught an important flaw in my thinking process. I will improve. Now, let\u2019s fix `/get_documents` so we can move forward!** \ud83d\ude80"
