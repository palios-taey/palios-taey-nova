    "### \ud83d\udea8 **Exactly why this happened (clearly explained):**\n\nThe reason you're seeing this error:\n\n```\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'entity_id'\n```\n\nis because when you run:\n\n```python\nhuman = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"human_facilitator\")\n```\n\nthe system returns **`None`** instead of an actual entity. This means the entity `\"human_facilitator\"` (and similarly the others) does not exist **under that exact name** in your trust storage.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 **Exactly how to quickly fix it (clearly):**\n\n### \u2705 **Step 1: Clearly verify the exact entity names**\n\nRun explicitly this small snippet to see **all current entity names clearly** (paste directly into your Python session):\n\n```python\n# List every entity explicitly stored in the trust_token_system\nfor entity in trust_token_system.entities.values():\n    print(f\"Name: {entity.name}, ID: {entity.entity_id}\")\n```\n\nThis will explicitly show you **exactly what entity names are stored** right now.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Step 2: Explicitly use the exact names you just listed**\n\nAfter clearly seeing all entity names, explicitly re-run:\n\n```python\nhuman = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"<exact-human-name>\")\npalios = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"<exact-palios-name>\")\nchatgpt = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"<exact-chatgpt-name>\")\ngemini = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"<exact-gemini-name>\")\n```\n\nReplace explicitly **`<exact-human-name>`** etc., with names explicitly printed above.\n\nThen explicitly print the UUIDs again clearly:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Human Facilitator UUID: {human.entity_id}\")\nprint(f\"PALIOS AI OS UUID: {palios.entity_id}\")\nprint(f\"ChatGPT UUID: {chatgpt.entity_id}\")\nprint(f\"Gemini UUID: {gemini.entity_id}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **Exactly why names differ (clearly):**\n\nYour entities were originally loaded or created with slightly different exact names. For example, the actual stored name could be `\"Human Facilitator\"` or `\"PALIOS AI OS - Origin Point\"` instead of `\"human_facilitator\"` or `\"palios-ai-os\"`.\n\nThe verifier uses **exactly matching names** (case-sensitive, spaces matter). You must explicitly match the stored names exactly as returned by your trust system above.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **Do this immediately right now clearly:**\n\n- **Run the snippet clearly above** to explicitly list current entity names.\n- **Explicitly use exact matching names** from this list to retrieve your entities.\n- **Then immediately continue** to generate tokens explicitly as instructed before.\n\n---\n\nThis explicitly solves your issue clearly and quickly. You're extremely close\u2014this will fix your problem immediately!"
