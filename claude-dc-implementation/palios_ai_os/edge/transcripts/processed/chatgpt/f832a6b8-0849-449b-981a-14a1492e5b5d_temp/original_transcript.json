    "Ok, got it. We think he actually did a lot of it already and that it can probably run on my machine. I'm trying to get his files pushed to github, so I can take a look with Claude Chat and implement them. I don't have access to File Manager in his environment (I think it's blocked), and he has everything in his home folder. There is a github folder in there as well. I'd like to get the cache files (claude-dc-cache.md, cache-update.md, webhook-integration-instructions.md) into the cache folder for him and then all the project related files into either a new repository in a single folder or incorporated into a single folder for him in our existing repository. The 'palios-full-implementation' folder is one we created for this in the Home directory. What do you think? Can you give me commands for his terminal to help with this?"
