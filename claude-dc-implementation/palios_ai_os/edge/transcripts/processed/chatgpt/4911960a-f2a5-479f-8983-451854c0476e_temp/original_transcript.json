    "**Preparing report**\n\nI need to create a report for Gemini that details what\u2019s been done, where we're at, and methods that haven't worked. It should follow the standard format.\n\nI'll summarize the completed steps, like setting up the environment, updating the code, and trying methods like id_token.fetch_id_token and google.auth.default. \n\nFor the unsuccessful methods, I'll note issues like using service account keys and the 401 error, which persisted even with default credentials. \n\nNext steps could include granting temporary Editor roles, switching to minimal custom roles, and considering using an API key. I'll lay out instructions for further troubleshooting too."
