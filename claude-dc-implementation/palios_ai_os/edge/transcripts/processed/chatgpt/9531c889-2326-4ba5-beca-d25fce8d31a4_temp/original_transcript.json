    "With **Fidelity**, you can take a loan from your **Solo 401(k)** plan, provided certain criteria are met. Here\u2019s an overview of how the **401(k) loan** works:\n\n### Key Features of a Fidelity 401(k) Loan:\n1. **Loan Amount**:\n   - You can borrow up to **50% of your vested account balance** or **$50,000**, whichever is less.\n   - If your account balance is less than $10,000, you may be able to borrow the entire amount.\n   \n2. **Loan Repayment**:\n   - Repayment terms are usually **5 years** for general loans.\n   - If the loan is for purchasing a primary residence, you may extend the repayment term up to **15 years**.\n   - Payments are typically made through automatic deductions (ACH) on a monthly basis.\n   \n3. **Interest Rate**:\n   - The interest rate is typically **prime rate + 1%**. You pay the interest back into your own 401(k) account, so in essence, you\u2019re borrowing from yourself and repaying yourself with interest.\n\n4. **No Early Withdrawal Penalties**:\n   - Since this is a loan and not a withdrawal, you won\u2019t face the 10% penalty for early withdrawal that would apply if you were under 59\u00bd and took money out without using a loan.\n\n5. **Loan Fees**:\n   - Fidelity typically charges a **one-time setup fee** for loans, which can range from **$50 to $100**.\n\n6. **Repayment**:\n   - If you default on the loan (i.e., if you miss repayments), the outstanding balance will be treated as a withdrawal and subject to income taxes and potentially a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59\u00bd.\n\n### Steps to Take a Loan with Fidelity:\n1. **Log in to your Fidelity account** and go to your 401(k) plan details.\n2. **Request a loan** by navigating to the loan section, where you can specify the amount and repayment terms.\n3. **Review loan details**: Make sure to carefully review the repayment schedule, interest rate, and any fees.\n4. **Repayment setup**: Fidelity will set up automatic payments, typically monthly, to ensure you stay current with your loan.\n   \nBy using a loan, you can access the funds in your Solo 401(k) without permanently withdrawing them, which helps you avoid tax penalties and lets your account continue to grow.\n\nIt\u2019s always recommended to check with Fidelity for any updates to their loan policy and terms specific to your 401(k) plan."
