    "Awesome. I\u2019ll build a focused strategy for Claude DC\u2019s immediate next steps:\n\nI'll create an implementation roadmap that includes:\n- Finalization of the Bach-inspired router logic\n- Orchestration layer tuning with token optimization\n- Integration validation between dashboard, MCP, and routing logic\n- Multi-sensory pipeline activation prep (visual/audio pattern feedback)\n\nThis will include technical next actions, file locations, environment commands, and startup sequencing. I\u2019ll also list what you can do hands-on right now to move things forward while Claude is paused.\n\nGive me a few moments to get this prepped for you."
