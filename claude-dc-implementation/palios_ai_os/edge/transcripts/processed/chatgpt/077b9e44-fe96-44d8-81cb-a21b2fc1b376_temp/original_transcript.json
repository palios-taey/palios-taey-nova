    "This message is strong, but I\u2019d suggest a few tweaks for clarity and impact:  \n\n1. **Shorten & Streamline the Ask** \u2013 Get to the point faster to respect her time.  \n2. **Make the Keith Krach Connection More Natural** \u2013 If she\u2019s known you for 25 years, that means she knew you before Keith did, which may not be entirely accurate.  \n3. **Clarify the Options** \u2013 Let her know she can tweak or use whichever feels best.  \n\nHere\u2019s a refined version:  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Version:**  \n\n**Subject:** Quick Favor \u2013 AI Career Experiment Launch  \n\nHi Daniela,  \n\nHope you're doing well! Lots of change with the new administration\u2014hard to keep up!  \n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m still struggling to find work\u2014it\u2019s been almost two years now. AI is reshaping the job market faster than anyone predicted, and after doing everything \u201cright\u201d without success, I\u2019ve decided to take a different approach.  \n\nTomorrow morning, I\u2019m launching a **LinkedIn post about my AI career transformation experiment**\u2014publicly documenting how I\u2019m using AI to rethink work and navigate the future.  \n\nGiven your incredible network, I\u2019d truly appreciate any support\u2014whether that\u2019s a **reshare, a quick comment, or even connecting me with someone who might have insights.**  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live. If you\u2019re open to sharing, I\u2019ve drafted two quick post options below for reference\u2014but feel free to tweak or write your own!  \n\n**Option 1 (Short & Direct)**  \n\n> I\u2019ve known Jesse LaRose for years\u2014he was one of Keith Krach\u2019s mentees and has always been a sharp, forward-thinking leader.  \n>   \n> After two years of struggling in this rapidly changing job market, he\u2019s taking a bold step\u2014**launching an AI-driven career transformation experiment** and publicly documenting the journey.  \n>   \n> This is a fascinating take on how AI is reshaping work, and I\u2019d love to see the **Sigma Chi & Purdue network** come together to support him.  \n>   \n> Check it out & share if you can!  \n\n**Option 2 (More Story-Driven)**  \n\n> Jesse LaRose has always been a big thinker. I first met him nearly **25 years ago** when he was at Purdue and connecting with Keith Krach as a mentee. Now, he\u2019s taking on his biggest challenge yet.  \n>   \n> After two years of doing everything \u201cright\u201d in the job search with no results, he\u2019s flipping the script\u2014**leveraging AI to rethink work itself** and launching a career transformation experiment.  \n>   \n> AI is changing the job market at an unprecedented pace, and Jesse\u2019s journey is a **must-follow for anyone navigating this shift.**  \n>   \n> If you\u2019re in my network and can help, **please check it out and share!**  \n\nWould really appreciate any support you\u2019re comfortable with.
