    "The dependency conflict you've encountered relates to the `grpcio-status` package requiring a higher version of `protobuf` (\u22655.26.1), while TensorFlow-ROCm installed a lower version (`protobuf 4.25.6`).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **Quick Fix**\n\nTo resolve this dependency conflict and ensure full compatibility, you should explicitly upgrade `protobuf`:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade protobuf\n```\n\nThis will update `protobuf` to the latest stable version compatible with `grpcio-status`.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Confirm Fix**\n\nAfter running the upgrade command, confirm dependencies are resolved:\n\n```bash\npip check\n```\n\nYou should no longer see the incompatibility warning.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **Important Compatibility Check**\n\nTensorFlow-ROCm officially supports `protobuf` up to version `4.x`. The warning you received about `grpcio-status` is likely because of mixed dependencies from different libraries.\n\nYou have two choices:\n\n**(1) Upgrade `grpcio-status` to match compatibility with existing `protobuf`:**\n```bash\npip install --upgrade grpcio-status\n```\n\nIf an upgrade isn't available or doesn't resolve the issue:\n\n**(2) Downgrade `grpcio-status` to a compatible version:**\n```bash\npip install grpcio-status==1.60.0\n```\n\nVersion `1.60.0` is stable and works well with `protobuf 4.x`.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea **Recommended Steps (Quickest Path)**\n\nExecute the following commands to quickly resolve the dependency issue:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade protobuf\npip install --upgrade grpcio-status\npip check\n```\n\n- If `pip check` still reports issues, use the downgrade path:\n```bash\npip install grpcio-status==1.60.0\npip check\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea9 **Next Step: Test TensorFlow-ROCm GPU availability**\n\nRun this test script after dependencies are resolved:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nprint(\"GPUs available:\", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))\n```\n\n---\n\nThis resolves your current error and ensures you're set up correctly for ROCm GPU usage. Let me know the output or if further issues arise!"
