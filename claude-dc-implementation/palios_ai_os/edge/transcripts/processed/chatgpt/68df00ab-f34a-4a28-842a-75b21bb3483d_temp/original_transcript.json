    "TensorFlow-ROCm specifically requires **`protobuf < 5.0.0`**. Your current installation of `protobuf 5.26.1` is incompatible.\n\nHere's how we can fix this clearly and permanently:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Recommended Immediate Fix:\n\n**Step 1: Downgrade protobuf to a TensorFlow-ROCm compatible version** (`4.25.3` is known compatible):\n\n```bash\npip install protobuf==4.25.3\n```\n\nThen immediately verify again with:\n\n```bash\npip check\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Long-Term Stability (requirements.txt)**:\n\nUpdate your `requirements.txt` accordingly to avoid future conflicts:\n\n```bash\nprotobuf==4.25.3\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Why `protobuf==4.25.3`?\n\n- Compatible with `tensorflow-rocm`\n- Compatible with `grpcio-status`, `google-cloud-*`, and `streamlit`\n- Widely tested stable version used across many TensorFlow-based environments.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 Verify GPU & TensorFlow Compatibility:\n\nTo ensure everything is working smoothly afterward, run this quick check again:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nprint(\"GPUs available:\", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd11 **Final Recommended Commands**:\n\nRun these two commands right now to fix permanently:\n\n```bash\npip install protobuf==4.25.3\npip check\n```\n\nThis resolves your dependency conflicts clearly and permanently.\n\nLet me know how it goes!"
