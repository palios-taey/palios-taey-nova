    "My first move is to ask you how to balance everything and have all launches ready for Tuesday AM at the optimal in the best way possible. This date CANNOT move, and I need you to prioritize my time today accordingly. I need 1 hour to do a 45 min insanity workout, 15 to do a cold plunge, a few min to do inversion table. Between now and then, we need some time to refine the LinkedIn messaging and X messaging launch. Can you please develop a plan for today? I go to bed at 10, so can work until then with some breaks for having dinner/beach walk and to recharge."
