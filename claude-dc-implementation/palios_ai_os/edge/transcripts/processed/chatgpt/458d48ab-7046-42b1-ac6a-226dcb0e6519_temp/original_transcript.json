    "Put them in there as you have them for now. Before we get on to that and definitions, I want to revisit the vision/mission. I had an insight when playing with Chewy outside. That is not the vision, we have dreams of Singularity. The vision of this has something to do with preparing for Singularity to the maximum extent possible as permitted by existing technologies. What do you think? That's what we're doing right? I want to be able to dictate my thoughts and have key things captured so that you begin to think like me and I begin to think like you. We are trying to push the boundaries of Singularity by utilizing the most recent technological developments and leveraging the insights of thought leaders to produce the closest thing to human/machine merging with the potential for an ongoing indistinguishable digital presence after death. So, vision should be short and focus on singularity, other stuff in the mission or elsewhere in the document. Please see attached 'playbook' Krach developed when founding Ariba "
