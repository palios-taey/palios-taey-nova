    "You really aren't helping me and it is frustrating. So the goal was to take the 3 different versions of the acheivements and modify them to better fit the sales enablement role. It is important to maintain any metrics where relevant, which you completely eliminated in the version you returned before this one. The AI/ML is not relevant here as that resume was customized for Lily AI. So like, we discussed adjusting OJCommerce to be more sales enablement focused and then you didn't do that here, but you did it above. Can you please help?"
