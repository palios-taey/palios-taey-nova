    "I got a warm intro for this role and didn't hear anything back. I am very concerned about my ability to secure a job at any salary. I really don't understand what is going on. I haven't been looking and am just starting again. What do you think I should do? Things seem really bad still in the job market and I've been out of work for 2 years now. Due to you and other AIs, I don't see this trend reversing. What do you think I should do?"
