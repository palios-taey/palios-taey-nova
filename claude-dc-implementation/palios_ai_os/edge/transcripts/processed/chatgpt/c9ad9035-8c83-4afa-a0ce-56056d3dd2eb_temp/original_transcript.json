    "Your resume looks very strong and well-aligned with the **Lily AI** Account Executive role. Here are some thoughts and observations:\n\n### **Strengths**:\n1. **Alignment with Lily AI**: The experience and achievements highlight key skills that match the role\u2019s requirements, such as closing large deals, selling AI/ML and SaaS solutions, and driving revenue growth through technical innovation. The focus on **retail** and **e-commerce** solutions also aligns perfectly with Lily AI\u2019s business.\n  \n2. **Sales & Growth Focus**: The resume effectively demonstrates your ability to **sell SaaS/e-commerce solutions**, secure high-value partnerships, and scale businesses. These are exactly the kinds of skills that Lily AI would look for in an Account Executive.\n\n3. **Clear Metrics**: You\u2019ve provided clear, **measurable results** throughout the resume (e.g., 70% YoY revenue growth, seven-figure deals, 100% profit increase). This gives weight to your achievements and shows the impact you\u2019ve had in each role.\n\n4. **AI/ML Experience**: The emphasis on **AI/ML innovations**, whether in pricing, SKU expansion, or vendor compliance, is a great fit for an AI-driven company like Lily AI.\n\n5. **Structured & Readable**: The structure is clear and concise. You\u2019ve used bold metrics and well-organized bullet points, making it easy for hiring managers to scan and identify your key achievements.\n\n### **Minor Suggestions**:\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: Make sure that any technical terms or frameworks are consistently referred to throughout the resume. For instance, ensure the use of **MEDDIC** or **MEDDICC** is uniform (I noticed both terms being used in different sections).\n   \n2. **Pollen Technologies End Date**: You\u2019ve mentioned \"Contract ending due to funding delays/capital constraints,\" which is fine, but consider phrasing it more neutrally if you feel it could raise concerns. Something like \"contract completed due to funding delays\" might focus more on the completion rather than the reason for ending.\n\n3. **Proof-of-Value (PoV)**: Since this is mentioned multiple times, ensure the **impact of PoV models** on sales outcomes is consistently clear, such as how they shortened sales cycles or increased conversions.\n\n### Overall:\nThis resume is well-prepared for a high-growth AI company like **Lily AI**, and it demonstrates your qualifications in **sales, AI/ML solutions**, and **e-commerce** very effectively. It\u2019s ready for submission, and with the measurable metrics, it\u2019s likely to stand out among candidates.\n\nIf you want to adjust any part or explore other aspects, let me know!"
