    "Your ChatGPT transcript processor script executed correctly in terms of processing the ChatGPT JSON structure, but the current error you encountered is coming from `edge_processor.py`:\n\n**Error**:\n```\nKeyError: 'data_id'\n```\n\nThis means the JSON file being passed to your Edge Processor doesn't contain the required field `data_id`. Currently, your Edge Processor expects this key to always exist.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd **How to Fix This Clearly**:\nThe simplest and best solution is to modify your `edge_processor.py` to safely handle cases where the `data_id` might be missing, by auto-generating a default one if it's not present.\n\n### \u2705 **Exact Fix (Modify your `edge_processor.py`):**\n\nUpdate line **423** (currently causing the error):\n\n```python\ndata_id=data_dict['data_id'],\n```\n\nReplace it with:\n\n```python\ndata_id=data_dict.get('data_id', str(uuid.uuid4())),\n```\n\nAdditionally, at the top of your `edge_processor.py`, ensure you have:\n\n```python\nimport uuid\n```\n\n**Why This Fix Works:**\n- Gracefully handles missing `data_id` fields by generating a new unique ID.\n- Immediately prevents the KeyError you're experiencing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **Next Action for You:**\nMake this quick fix to your `edge_processor.py` and then re-run your ChatGPT processor:\n\n```bash\npython3 process_chatgpt_transcripts.py\n```\n\nOnce confirmed working, we can smoothly proceed to create the dedicated processor for Claude."
