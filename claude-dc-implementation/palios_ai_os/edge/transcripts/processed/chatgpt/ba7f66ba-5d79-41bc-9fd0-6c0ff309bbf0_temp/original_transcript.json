    "Yes, referencing the source in **other relevant tables** makes complete sense. This ensures **AI knows where insights originated** and can retrieve full context when needed.  \n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Adjustments Needed: Adding Source References**\nWe should allow **multiple sources** (many-to-many relation) because insights often come from multiple books, research, podcasts, etc.  \n\nHere\u2019s where we should add **Source (Relation to Knowledge Vault):**\n\n\ud83d\udccc **PKD (Personal Knowledge Database)**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Why?** If you override AI with personal experience, it\u2019s useful to know if that contradicts known research.  \n**\u2705 Add: \"Source\" (Relation to Knowledge Vault, Multi-Select)**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **AI Workflows**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Why?** AI processes should be **backed by knowledge** when making workflow decisions.  \n**\u2705 Add: \"Source\" (Relation to Knowledge Vault, Multi-Select)**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **AI Influencers & Thought Leaders**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Why?** So AI knows where their insights originated (books, podcasts, etc.).  \n**\u2705 Add: \"Influence Source\" (Relation to Knowledge Vault, Multi-Select)**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **AI Research**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Why?** Research insights should link to full papers, books, or studies.  \n**\u2705 Add: \"Source\" (Relation to Knowledge Vault, Multi-Select)**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Final Adjusted Tables & New Fields**\n| Table | New Field | Type | Purpose |\n|--------|------------|------|-----------|\n| **PKD** | Source | Relation (Multi) \u2192 Knowledge Vault | Shows if overridden AI insights are backed or contradicted by sources. |\n| **AI Workflows** | Source | Relation (Multi) \u2192 Knowledge Vault | AI knows **what research backs** automation decisions. |\n| **AI Influencers** | Influence Source | Relation (Multi) \u2192 Knowledge Vault | Connects influencers to **books, interviews, podcasts** they\u2019ve contributed to. |\n| **AI Research** | Source | Relation (Multi) \u2192 Knowledge Vault | Links research findings back to full content for deeper analysis. |\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Why This Matters**\n\u2714 **AI can pull insights from validated sources in real-time.**  \n\u2714 **Improves retrieval speed (AI doesn\u2019t have to reprocess content every time).**  \n\u2714 **Allows AI to highlight conflicts between personal experience (PKD) and external research.**  \n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Final Confirmation:**  \n\u2705 Are you good with adding these source references?  \n\u2705 If yes, I'll guide you through **adding these fields to Notion** and structuring it efficiently."
