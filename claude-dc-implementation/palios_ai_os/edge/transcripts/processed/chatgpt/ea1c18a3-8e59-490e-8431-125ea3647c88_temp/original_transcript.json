    "Now that LinkedIn has slowed down and Chewy's posts are live, here\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend next:\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Engage More on LinkedIn to Sustain Momentum**\n- Go through your feed and comment on posts from people in your network. \n- Engage on AI-related or job market discussions where your post could be relevant.\n- If any big AI or career influencers are posting, drop a thoughtful comment so people check out your profile.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Push Chewy\u2019s Content to X**\n- Take the best performing video/photo from Instagram and post it to X.\n- Engage with dog influencer accounts, comment on their posts, and reply to followers who engage.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 **X Automation & Growth**\n- Find & follow 50-100 relevant accounts (AI, job search, football, dog influencers).\n- Reply to at least 10 tweets from high-engagement accounts.\n- Quote tweet relevant AI/job market discussions linking back to your post.\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Next LinkedIn Play**\n- Would a follow-up post tomorrow morning make sense? Maybe a recap of learnings so far, insights from responses, or next steps in the AI experiment.\n\nWhat feels most pressing to you?"
