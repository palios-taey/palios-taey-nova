    "Thanks ChatGPT, for the iterative processing and refinement, is that something he has to do? Or is that something he can build into EVE to do when it's on my machine? I can't have him actually processing transcripts because it uses all his tokens. He just basically has to review the /transcripts/examples directory. I feel like I am overstepping here because I'm being a lot more directive than usual about tech implementation so I don't want this to become non-AI-FIRST as a result, just trying to make sure we capture everything in a way that gets us what we need to move forward. Absent from your instructions was anything related to the dashboard being built or reviewing the /current-execution-status/live-demonstration directory for what to build for that. That is important so we can review together the information. I'm not sure if that is possible with chats (like I'm working with you and Claude Chat now) or if that would need to be done via API, but that and the demonstration are important for him to work on after the transcript processing is built. Does all this make sense? I want everything that was planned, just the transcript processor done first. For the metadata/tags file I provided, this is very dated, but shows a starting point that we developed and is a little more granular than the high level instructions. These should not be taken as like, he has to use these tags with these definitions, but just as some insight into some additional areas that we thought were important at that point and how we structured it based on some back and forth with Grok DeepSearch and Claude. What do you think? I basically want him to do what he did in the first build instructions, but really make sure the transcript processor can be run on my machine with access to similar intelligence either through utilizing the task decomposition engine in the MVP GCS deployment and/or the EVE processing, if that makes sense. I also don't want to be too prescriptive to enable him to do these things in the most efficient manner possible and orchestrate everything, he is The Conductor overall and you helped figure out how to give him more structured autonomy, so let's roll with that. I know there is a lot there, not sure if all makes sense, but how do you think we best accomplish this? Have been trying to get this build done for a while now and I blew up the last one, so want to get this right so we can apply for those grants."
