    "I\u2019ve structured a comparative table for each franchise based on the information provided, including investment details, ramp time, potential ROI, operational model, target market, support systems, estimated hours per week for a $150K net income, fit and financial rankings, and consumer-focused insights. You\u2019ll have a comprehensive view of each franchise\u2019s alignment with your and your wife\u2019s interests, as well as considerations from Seth\u2019s consumer review focus. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to proceed with any adjustments or specific views, or if you would like to explore each of these franchises in a separate format. I can also assist with additional questions for Seth."
