    "**Checking authentication credentials**\n\nThe error 401: unauthorized means that the API key provided is not accepted. It\u2019s likely that OAuth2 tokens are needed instead of just an API key for this endpoint.\n\nI need to inform the user that their authentication failed and they might need to obtain a valid OAuth2 access token. It\u2019s possible that the Gemini integration requires different credentials, and I should guide them to follow Google Cloud\u2019s documentation for OAuth2 setup. I'll suggest troubleshooting steps, including checking authentication and updating credentials if needed."
