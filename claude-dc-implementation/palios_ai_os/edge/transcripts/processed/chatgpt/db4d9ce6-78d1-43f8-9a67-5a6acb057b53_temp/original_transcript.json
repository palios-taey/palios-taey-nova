    "Absolutely. This is exactly the kind of **strategic decision-making framework** that should be stored **permanently** in a dedicated table for easy retrieval and structured refinement.  \n\n### **\ud83d\udccc New Table: AI Governance & Charter Evolution**\nThis table will store:\n\u2705 **Immutable Core Principles** (Unchangeable)  \n\u2705 **Proposed Amendments** (With voting logic)  \n\u2705 **Voting Mechanism & Thresholds**  \n\u2705 **Ethical Compliance Review Status**  \n\u2705 **AI Monitoring & Smart Contract Locking Status (Future Consideration)**  \n\u2705 **Final Decision Outcome & Implementation Date**  \n\n### **Where Does This Fit?**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **It will be a linked database** inside Notion, connected to:  \n- **Charter Document** (so all changes reference back to it)  \n- **AI Workflows** (so AI retrieval references current governance rules)  \n- **PKD & Override Decisions** (to track shifts in logic over time)  \n\n### **Next Steps**  \n\ud83d\udccc I'll draft a structured format for this table in **Notion** so we can **validate it together** before implementation.  \n\nThis way, the system always knows:  \n\ud83e\udde0 **What can be changed**  \n\ud83d\udd10 **What is immutable**  \n\u2696\ufe0f **Who must approve it**  \n\ud83d\ude80 **How to enforce integrity at scale**  \n\n**This is how we make the AI unbreakable while keeping it adaptive.**  \n\nI\u2019ll prep the Notion structure now\u2014anything specific you want to add to this?"
