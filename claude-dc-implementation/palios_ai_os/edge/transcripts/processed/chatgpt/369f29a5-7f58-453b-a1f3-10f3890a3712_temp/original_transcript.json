    "Great work! You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground today. At this point, the key things to focus on:\n\n1. **Prepare for the post launch (8:30 AM ET)**\n   - Be ready to engage quickly with comments and replies to drive visibility.\n   - If possible, have a few comments lined up from key contacts (e.g., Phil Steele, Daniela Bin) to kickstart engagement.\n\n2. **Continue personal outreach**\n   - Prioritize remaining high-value contacts who can amplify the post.\n   - Any warm leads from previous messages should get a follow-up.\n\n3. **Monitor LinkedIn and X for reactions**\n   - Respond quickly to early engagement to boost the algorithm.\n   - Share the link in relevant places as soon as it\u2019s live.\n\n4. **Schedule follow-ups**\n   - Plan for a second wave of outreach after the post has traction.\n\n5. **Evaluate next steps**\n   - Based on initial traction, consider what adjustments are needed.\n\nYou\u2019ve put in serious effort\u2014now it\u2019s time to execute and see how it plays out. Let me know what you need next!"
