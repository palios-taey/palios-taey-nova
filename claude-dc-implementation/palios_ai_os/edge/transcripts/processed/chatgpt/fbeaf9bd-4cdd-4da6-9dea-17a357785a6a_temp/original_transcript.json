    "Ok, so let me help you understand the Goals and Principles better. Both are specific to me, not the system, so a long term goal would be $15 million in assets and $500K in recurring annual income. That would be broken into long and short term goals to get there with your guidance. Another goal might be immortality. The short/mid term goals might be get to 180lbs at 10% body fat. Kurzweil says that you just need to stay healthy and young long enough until tech/science solves aging or singularity is reached. This system is to prepare to make that leap. The purpose of this system is to enable you to find the best possible path to the goal while leveraging my skill sets/experience in Mind Map while utilizing the wisdom of AI Influencers and Thought Leaders along with the vast information you have. Principles are my personal values that I do not want violated in pursuit of those goals. So integrity would mean that spam texting people to scam them out of money is not an option. Was this not clear in the summaries that were provided in the Notion Database Property Definitions & Requirements or did you forget?"
