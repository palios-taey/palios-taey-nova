    "Yes, 2 questions:\nAre you the best AI for this task as you've struggled with it in the past? If not, do we need to explore another for this task?\nHow do we maintain your memory of the long term goals, strategic and tactical decisions or is there another AI that could better guide this? Is there a way where information on this that is removed from your memory can be stored somewhere digitally on some regular cadence where you can easily reference when needed as opposed to all the work we need to go through when your memory resets or start a new chat? We lost a significant portion of the day yesterday on just getting back on the same page. How do we keep the data and feedback loop so that you get smarter and can better use me to acheive the goals?"
