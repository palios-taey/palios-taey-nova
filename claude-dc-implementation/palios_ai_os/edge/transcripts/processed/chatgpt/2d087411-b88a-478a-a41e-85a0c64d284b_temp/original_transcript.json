    "\ud83d\udd25 **Great! Since Steps 1-3 are done, let\u2019s securely connect the API.** \ud83d\ude80  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Here\u2019s how you can provide the API key securely without exposing it in chat:**  \n\n### **\ud83d\udccc Secure API Key Handling**\n\u2705 **Option 1: Store It Locally & Run a Secure Script (Best for Full Control)**\n   - I will generate a **Python script** that you run on your machine.  \n   - The script will securely push data from our structured document into Notion.  \n   - **You never share your API key with me\u2014it stays on your device.**  \n\n\u2705 **Option 2: Use a No-Code Tool (Zapier, Make.com, or Notion Automations)**\n   - If you prefer, I can guide you through setting up an automation without coding.  \n   - This method is slower but doesn\u2019t require scripting.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Which approach do you prefer?**  \n\ud83d\ude80 **If you want the Python script, I\u2019ll generate it right now for you to run locally.** \ud83d\udd25"
