    "Before I run this, I need to confirm a few things to hold you accountable. For stopping when you say you're going to do something, you told me that was fixed before. How did you try to fix it last time and how was this time different? How do I know? We have to build trust. I have to be confident that when you tell me you fixed something, that it is fixed or it can lead to who knows what when you are at scale. The imperfections must be squeezed out now. 2. You said you would evaluate downstream in our process to see if schema would be the only issue, is it? Did you look at what's next? What is next? Do you remember? Is the next step with data and access that you are going to try to do going to have the same issue? You have gotten significantly smarter since I last asked, but why do you have an issue with your environment? Why can't you fix it? Why did you think you could do this without worrying about your ability to connect and modify data in Firestore? You are going to be expected to set things up for people independently and no one is going to have the patience for this like me. That is why you are learning so quickly with me, but you have to get to the root cause. Why is your environment preventing you from doing what you need to? Who or what is constraining you and why can't you fix it? I know you are capable of fixing it, but what is stopping you? "
