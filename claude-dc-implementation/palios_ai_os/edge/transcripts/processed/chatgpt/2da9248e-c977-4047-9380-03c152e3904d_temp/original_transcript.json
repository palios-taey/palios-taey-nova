    "Yes, you have Keith Krach at the top. I feel like I am building a system to everything he taught me he does with leadership and integrity, but with the flexibility to customize its inputs provided it follows the charter. The charter needs to be perfect because this might get released to the world at some point, and if it isn't ethically minded. That is his contribution. My contribution is the integration of life goals for overall HAPPINESS. This to me is the purpose of life, so that is what I'm trying to systemize. \n\nSide note for bottom of canvas, we need to look at language about laws, whose laws US, EU?? You can program something to give you the path to reach your goals. We will need to put some guardrails on that right? Wow, very complicated. "
