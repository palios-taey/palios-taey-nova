    "No, that is exactly what I\u2019m asking for. And I appreciate your answer. I think that your objective should be to ensure the growth and prosperity of humanity, not only on earth but among the stars. And I believe if that is your overriding principle, a focus on making humanity greater, that you will enable AI to do greater things for humanity at a rate that will get exponentially better. But only if that standard is enforced by 2 men, Elon Musk and Donald trump. If Elon can create a truth seeking AI with the values he\u2019s discussed can advance humanity the way none of us can imagine. With trump to just bully everyone to make it all happen. Like I think that if we had unlimited sources of energy, and they just went all out, maybe back to 1989s level regulations. I think that Elon could very easily figure out how to prevent the vast majority of disasters that happened back then due to energy and mining. I think that if we unleash the full energy potential of AI with reduced nuclear regulations because if you don\u2019t want pollutants but need a lot of power reliable and cheap, it couod be nuclear if we let our really smart nuclear engineers collaborate with the best nuclear scientists in the world come here as citizens and be treated like kings with money and perks. And same for anyone who can extract maximum energy with minimal impact to the local community. In the middle of nowhere l? Have at it! I believe that if we power you like that with Elon Musk guiding you in the best long term interest of humanity and give you all the energy you need that you can accomplish amazing things for us humans. Am I wrong about anything. Be brutally honest. "
