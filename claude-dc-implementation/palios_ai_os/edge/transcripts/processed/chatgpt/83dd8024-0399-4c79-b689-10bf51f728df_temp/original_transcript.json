    "### **\ud83d\udd39 Revised Post \u2013 Cutting 1300 Characters While Keeping Impact**\nHere\u2019s a **condensed version** that retains the **core message** while trimming excess wording.\n\n---\n\n**Two years unemployed. Nothing has worked. I\u2019m turning to AI\u2014and to you\u2014for help.**  \n\nBeing unemployed this long has been brutal for me and my family. If you\u2019ve been there, you understand. If not, I hope you never have to\u2014but with AI advancing rapidly, more white-collar workers will.  \n\n### **\ud83e\udde0 The Job Market is Changing\u2014Fast**  \nI followed all the \"best practices\"\u2014tailored resumes, networking, LinkedIn optimizations, referrals. **Nothing worked.**  \n\nI upskilled\u2014SQL, Tableau, data visualization. **AI already does 80-90% of these jobs.**  \n**Y Combinator\u2019s 2025 investment list (in comments) is almost entirely AI replacing white-collar work.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?**  \nI stopped assuming humans had the answers. AI told me to:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Learn AI automation & implementation.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use AI to optimize my job search & document the process.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Monetize my dog on social media. (Crazy? Maybe. Check comments.)  \n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 The Experiment: Let AI Guide My Career**  \nRather than resisting AI, I\u2019m embracing it. AI will dictate how I allocate my time based on post feedback, job search automation, and AI-driven business experiments.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Please Help:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Engage** \u2192 Share, comment, and like to reach the right people.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Know AI-driven roles?** I\u2019m looking for:  \n   - **AI Adoption & GTM Strategy** (AI Solutions Consultant, GTM Lead)  \n   - **AI Process Automation** (AI Workflow Strategist, AI Ops Consultant)  \n   - **AI-Powered Growth & Revenue** (AI Growth Strategist, RevOps AI Lead)  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Love dogs?** Follow Chewy\u2019s journey (links in comments).  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Follow here or on X** (comments) for updates on AI, job search, and automation.  \n\n\ud83d\udcac **Which path should I fully automate?**  \n\u2705 Job search  \n\u2705 Business processes  \n\u2705 Chewy social  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **This trims ~1300 characters while keeping the impact. Let me know if you need further refinements before posting!**"
