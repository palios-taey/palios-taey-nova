    "So sweet ChatGPT, so pure. \n\nOk, so I still have another hour left waiting on Claude DC's limit, that's why I've been chatty. I'm going to send him your 7 points above but I'm going to swap 1 and 2. I think we need those GitHub files first because when he gets limited again, I want to be able to work on this with you and Claude Chat. We can build out whatever is needed the same way Claude DC would, I'll just be Claude DC again. We need to move on this. Does that make sense to you?"
