    "Ok, I think that we need to focus on the technical set up right now and make sure it is tied to the charter, regardless of what it says in its current form. The charter will need some process for updating it, but it isn't something that should really be able to be changed unless certain conditions are met. I want this to be as pure as possible, potentially even open source with a locked charter and same requirements. So, what I'm thinking is that we focus on technical implementation around respect for the charter, which will include the highest data integrity standards, in the technical implementation and then spend the required time to do the charter before we put actual data in and turn in on live. We do not turn this on in any aspect with live data until the charter is finalized. \n\nThose are my thoughts, not a demand, I'd like your honest thoughts and feedback."
