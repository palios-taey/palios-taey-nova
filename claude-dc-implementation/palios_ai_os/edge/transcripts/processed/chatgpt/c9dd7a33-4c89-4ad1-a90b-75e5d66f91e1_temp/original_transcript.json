    "Here\u2019s a concise follow-up message for the hiring manager at Lily AI that addresses potential concerns about your network and emphasizes your value in other ways:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Following Up \u2013 Director of Sales at Lily AI\n\nHi [Hiring Manager\u2019s Name],\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to follow up regarding the Director of Sales position. I understand that having an extensive network of contacts is important, and while I may not have the largest Rolodex, I\u2019ve always made up for it with hard work, creativity, and a relentless drive to solve problems.\n\nIn my previous roles, I\u2019ve successfully built relationships from scratch by leveraging strategic research, a personalized outreach approach, and by offering meaningful value that resonates with key decision-makers. I thrive on identifying innovative ways to reach new clients and markets, whether through partnerships, cold outreach, or by amplifying existing connections. \n\nI\u2019m confident that my ability to execute and deliver results will far outweigh any gaps in an existing contact base. I would love the opportunity to discuss any concerns or clarify further how I can bring that value to Lily AI.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]  \n\n---\n\nThis message emphasizes your work ethic, creativity, and ability to build relationships from the ground up while addressing the potential concern about a lack of a large contact base."
