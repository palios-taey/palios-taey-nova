    "I am drafting a follow up response to the interview yesterday, can you review and provide any insight on language and additional questions that may be relevant?\n\nHi Julian,\nThanks for the time yesterday and sharing more about Lily AI and the AE role. I understand the high level of urgency around filling the position, so would like to support your decision making process on my candidacy. I'm going to work on a plan for the role with the focus of generating top of the funnel leads that I plan to submit tomorrow after speaking with Michael this afternoon. I have some questions requests below that I think would enable me to submit a higher quality plan that your feedback would be helpful on. If you have 15 minutes sometime today, it'd be great to review them quickly on the phone or email works as well.What are the target accounts for this AE? In the plan, I'll focus on these accounts and highlight any relationships or other avenues into these accounts along with an overview of any other connections I have in Lily's targeted retail segments.What is the sales quota for this role and roughly how many logos would be required to meet the quota?Has Lily targeted brands? If not, why?Does Lily's technology have the ability to transform data provided by a supplier to a retailer's product data requirements?You mentioned you had worked on some partnerships, but I see there is a Partnerships Director. I think there are a number of companies where referral partnerships might make sense. Is it within the scope of this role to pursue partnerships to support lead generation?\u00a0\nAlso, you mentioned a panel interview/presentation similar to what was conducted at Mirakl. Due to your timeline, I'm happy to start working on that as well and schedule that meeting if you can provide the details of the assignment with full understanding that you might not decide to get to that stage.\u00a0"
