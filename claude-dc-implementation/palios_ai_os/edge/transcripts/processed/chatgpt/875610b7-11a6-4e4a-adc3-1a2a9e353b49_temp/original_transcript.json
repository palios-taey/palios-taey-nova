    "Great! You're almost done\u2014here\u2019s **exactly** what's happening clearly explained, and how to quickly fix it:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **What's the Problem?**  \nYour git push is currently trying to use **HTTPS** instead of SSH. That's why it's prompting you for a username/password and failing. You already successfully set up your SSH keys, so you just need to switch your Git remote URL to SSH instead of HTTPS.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **How to fix this immediately:**  \n\nRun exactly this command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\nThis command **changes your existing git repository's remote from HTTPS to SSH**.  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea6 **Then, push again:**  \n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nThis time it **won't ask for your username/password**, and will authenticate via your SSH key (which you've already set up successfully).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udfe2 **Quick Explanation (Why this happened):**  \n- Git supports pushing via either HTTPS or SSH.\n- HTTPS uses username/password (or token).\n- SSH uses the keys you've created and added.\n- Your repository is currently set to HTTPS (which you don't want).\n- The above command fixes that by changing it permanently to SSH.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Exactly What To Do Right Now:**\n\n- Run this one-time command to switch your Git remote to SSH:\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\n- Then push again:\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nIt'll instantly work.\n\nYou're all set now!"
