    "How do I make him famous on social media? He catches footballs I throw to him on beach and likes to walk up to people and drop it and have them throw for him. He also likes to play with kids a lot and they really get a kick out of him. He like to take his morning poo on the beach at sunrise. He also does lots of cute things like sleep on his back on couch and in awkward positions on back and is just a really cute big dog. "
