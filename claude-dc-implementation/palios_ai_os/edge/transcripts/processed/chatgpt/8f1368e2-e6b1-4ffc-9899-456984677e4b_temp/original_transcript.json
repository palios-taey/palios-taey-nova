    "Yes, leadership roles seem like the best target for you based on your background and expertise. Your experience scaling businesses, leading cross-functional teams, driving process improvements, and managing growth positions you well for leadership roles, particularly in **operations**, **sales operations**, **customer success**, or **strategy-focused positions** within SaaS or e-commerce companies.\n\nHere\u2019s why leadership roles make sense:  \n\n1. **Track Record of Results**: Your achievements at OJCommerce, CommerceHub, and Mirakl demonstrate a clear ability to drive results, manage large initiatives, and scale operations. These are hallmarks of leadership potential.  \n\n2. **Cross-Functional Expertise**: You\u2019ve worked across sales, operations, marketing, partnerships, and product management, which gives you a unique ability to lead teams that span multiple disciplines.  \n\n3. **Strategic Acumen**: Your experience creating and securing approval for multi-million-dollar initiatives (e.g., the $100M+ drop ship plan at Mirakl) shows that you\u2019re capable of working at a strategic level, a key component of leadership roles.  \n\n4. **Career Stage**: With your level of experience, applying for mid-level or individual contributor roles may make hiring managers question why you\u2019re not pursuing leadership opportunities. Even if you don\u2019t land an executive-level role, you\u2019ll likely be considered for senior management positions with growth potential.\n\nThat said, if you're open to **non-leadership roles**, roles like **senior analyst**, **operations manager**, or **senior project manager** in SaaS or e-commerce companies could be excellent stepping stones, particularly if they lead to future leadership opportunities.\n\nWould you prefer to target both leadership and senior individual contributor roles, or focus exclusively on one? Your choice here will influence how we position your profile further."
