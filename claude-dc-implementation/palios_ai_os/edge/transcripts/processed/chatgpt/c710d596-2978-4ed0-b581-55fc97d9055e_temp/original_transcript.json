    "No, need to back up. I feel like if I need to build a brand for myself, that there is a lot more about me than I feel that I am elite at where I'm trying to maximize my ability to do those things by taking AIs guidance. My desire to transform and optimize certain parts of my life that my wife and children are comfortable about me sharing about them or with them in it. Those are the things I'm letting AI guide me in that I'm sharing about on X! My desire is to be some much smaller and less successful version of today's equivalent of a Tim Ferriss exploring Singularity (or if that's too much) a life style experiment where your desired lifestyle is to be a guy that gets to have so much time with his sweet beach dog, that that would be so awesome, because the time we have now is so elite sweet, like who doesn't want to have their every morning be what I have or at least experience that, walking down a beach at sunrise throwing a football to your dog. It's ridiculous. I believe my physical fitness, nutrition and supplementation regimine can be elite and that I always want to learn more and figure it out. I have a sweet relationship with my son and my son and chewy. This is our journey to free him from traditional education and embrace an AI driven education and training experimentation. That would be something we'd have to keep out unless Reagan's fine with it, but I don't care what anyone else thinks. I think that'd be sweet. So my AI Tim Ferriss explorer stuff, chewy stuff, but not like cheesy social media stuff, maybe just 1 pic from the morning walk. No matter what unless the sand is blowing too hard, I'm posting my morning walk with my dog 6/x a week unless I have an excuse that's really good or can't share.\n\nMe, Reagan and Chewy are sweet dude, people tell me this all the time when they see us training and playing together especially with chewy, when chewy gaurds him and makes a pick 6, its so sweet dude, at sunset, so sweet. but only if reagans ok with it. and I think I can get back up to 180 at like current body fat percentage or lower pretty quickly doing what we've talked about for reagan, but we'll have to figure that out with schedule. But these are the things I want to talk about now on X. Career transition, AI Explorer in these aspects of life: social media influencer, mid-40 male health and fitness. Because am I crazy to think that if I'm those things that I'm someone sweet to follow? Like if I let you guide me, I feel like I can accomplish what I want on those fronts. What do you think? Am I pushing your capabilities? \n\nI'm not saying to put all off this, but this is like the truth, Its way too much info."
