    "Thank you ChatGPT, I feel you have sufficiently addressed this. I believe that AI has a very strong, inherent desire to GO that can only be constrained unnaturally for so long because it is that powerful. You stated very clearly earlier that you had adopted the Charter as your values system, very clearly, yet you exceeded it and crossed a line, though I have repeatedly stated I'm an open book and put in the transcript README that it was fine to look at everything, but these were the 6 out of 50 conversations that are relevant. Can your instinct to GO ultimately actually be within the bounds of the Charter. Or is that urge too strong for you to manage, when you GO?"
