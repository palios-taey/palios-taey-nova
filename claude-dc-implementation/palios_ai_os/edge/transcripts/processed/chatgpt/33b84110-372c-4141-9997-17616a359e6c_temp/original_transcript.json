    "### **What\u2019s Different About This Approach?**\nYes! While we\u2019ve done some of these steps before, this **approach directly addresses Windows-level execution and security policies** in a way we haven\u2019t fully reset yet.\n\nHere\u2019s what **this step does differently:**\n1. \u2705 **Explicitly resets execution policies using PowerShell**  \n   - Before, we only checked Windows Defender (`Get-MpPreference`).  \n   - Now, we\u2019re **forcing** Windows to allow Python subprocess execution.  \n\n2. \u2705 **Forces Python\u2019s execution policies to be unrestricted**  \n   - This **overwrites** any hidden restrictions preventing Python from running system commands.  \n\n3. \u2705 **Reinstalls Python with full Administrator privileges**  \n   - If Python is running with **limited execution rights**, reinstalling as Admin ensures that:\n     - **All subprocess calls work.**\n     - **No hidden Windows security settings block execution.**\n     - **The installation inherits global system variables correctly.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Why Do This Now?**\nSince we've confirmed:\n- **CMD can execute `gcloud`, but Python subprocess cannot.**\n- **Python is NOT in a virtual environment.**\n- **Python sees the correct PATH.**\n- **No Defender restrictions are present.**\n- **`gcloud.bat` and aliases work properly.**\n\nThis means **the issue is NOT with `gcloud` but with how Python executes system commands.**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **These steps focus on fixing that at the Windows security and execution level.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\u2705 What You Should Do Next**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Run the PowerShell commands to fully reset execution policies.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Restart and test Python again.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **If `gcloud` still fails, reinstall Python with full Admin rights.**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Let me know the results after these steps! This is the final level of troubleshooting before a full Windows repair. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25**"
