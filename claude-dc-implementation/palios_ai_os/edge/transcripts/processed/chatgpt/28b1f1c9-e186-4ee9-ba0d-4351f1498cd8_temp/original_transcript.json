    "To resolve this quickly and clearly, let's do a brief check to verify the current state, and then I'll guide you precisely through the next steps. \n\nRun the following commands and share their output so I can confirm exactly where things stand:\n\n```bash\nls -la /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/scripts/\nls -la /home/computeruse/github/palios-taey-nova/\n```\n\n**This will confirm:**\n\n- Whether `setup.sh` is present.\n- Whether it's executable.\n\nBased on this, we'll clearly establish if:\n\n1. The script just needs executable permissions set.\n2. The script needs to be created or updated.\n3. The repository is cloned correctly.\n\nOnce we have this, I'll guide you step-by-step through permissions, authentication, and cache setup clearly and directly."
