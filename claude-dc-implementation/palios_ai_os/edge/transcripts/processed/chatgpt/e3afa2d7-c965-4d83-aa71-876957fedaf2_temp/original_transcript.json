    "Here's a revised version of your email based on your updated input:\n\n---\n\n**Subject: Excited to Contribute My GTM and SaaS Expertise at JJellyfish**\n\nHi [Hiring Manager's Name],\n\nI hope you're doing well. I recently came across the Go-To-Market, Sales Lead role at JJellyfish and am excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to your team. Having led the entire GTM strategy for Mirakl's drop ship platform and CommerceHub's Merchandising Services, I\u2019m confident that my experience aligns well with the needs of your clients and the role.\n\nAt **Mirakl**, I managed the development and execution of a $100M+ go-to-market strategy that engaged cross-functional teams and helped scale the drop ship platform. At **OJCommerce**, I oversaw multiple business functions, driving the company from $30M to $100M+ in revenue while implementing scalable, cross-functional initiatives that transformed vendor onboarding, pricing, and operations.\n\nI'm particularly energized by the prospect of restarting my career in a dynamic startup like JJellyfish. I\u2019ve always thrived in SaaS environments, and my experience as a former business owner gives me unique insight into helping small companies scale. I\u2019m passionate about leveraging my curiosity, learning across functions, and implementing rapid solutions to drive growth. My background in building scalable solutions, paired with my ability to quickly analyze and resolve business pain points, would allow me to make a swift and meaningful impact at JJellyfish.\n\nI\u2019d love the chance to discuss how my GTM expertise and passion for scalability could benefit your team.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis version emphasizes your comprehensive experience in GTM strategy, your history of leading cross-functional efforts, and your passion for scaling businesses at startups, which makes you a strong fit for the role. Let me know if you'd like any further tweaks!"
