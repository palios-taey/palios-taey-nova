    "Hey Chandler, hope you're doing great! I'm not sure how we connected on LinkedIn, but I feel like it was through something to do with Noah Kagan a long time back when you were just launching your self-publishing business. It's been great watching it take off, congrats on your success, I know you hustled hard for it!\n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for 2 years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is flipping everything upside down, and the job market is shifting faster than anyone is prepared for.\n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my career transformation experiment using AI\u2014and I\u2019d love your help.\n\nYou\u2019ve built an incredible audience by taking big swings, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here. A reshare comment or even just a like from you could help it reach the right people and make a real impact.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!\n\nThanks, man. Appreciate it.\n\n\u2014 Jesse"
