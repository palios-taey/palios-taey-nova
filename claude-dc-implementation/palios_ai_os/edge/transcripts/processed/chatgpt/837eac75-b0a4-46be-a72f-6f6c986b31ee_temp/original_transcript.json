Focused on vendor onboarding, product data management, and AI/ML-driven automation, overseeing a diverse vendor base of over 1,000 entities.\n\n**Vendor Onboarding & Revenue Growth**\n- Drove the primary growth engine by expanding vendor onboarding from 12 to 300 annually, leading to a 3x revenue increase. Developed an AI/ML algorithm to score vendor targets based on aggregated reviews and retail prices across sales channels, enabling efficient resource allocation and outreach.\n- Revamped the sales engagement process by implementing a highly automated funnel, including pre-trade show outreach and in-person follow-up at events. Created a two-tier engagement system: a self-service model for lower-tier vendors and personalized outreach for high-priority targets, managed by a skilled buying team.\n- Streamlined the contracting process, reducing friction by automating negotiation workflows, allowing for faster deal closures and minimizing legal back-and-forth.\n\n**Product Data & SKU Expansion**\n- Led category expansion initiatives that increased SKU count by 8x, launching new product categories such as pet, kitchen, tools, and hardware. Applied AI/ML algorithms to automate category mapping, feature mapping, and attribute mapping, significantly accelerating SKU onboarding across multiple verticals.\n- Solved complex issues like color mapping inconsistencies across marketplaces by deploying an AI algorithm that learned from historical data, enabling more accurate and scalable expansion into new categories.\n\n**AI/ML Algorithms & Compliance**\n- Spearheaded the development of an AI-driven pricing algorithm that optimized pricing across multiple channels, resulting in a 100% increase in divisional profitability.\n- Developed a compliance monitoring AI/ML algorithm that used historical data to predict and flag potential vendor issues before they impacted key metrics, leading to a 70% improvement in vendor performance.\n- Automated freight claim processes, reducing losses by $300K annually and improving cash flow management.\n\n**Operational Excellence**\n- Hired, trained, and managed an international team of 12 merchants and support staff, with additional responsibilities for HR, Finance, and Data Analytics functions.\n- Standardized contract processes and automated dispute resolutions, reducing both legal costs and resolution times while enhancing vendor relationships.\n\n---\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **Vendor Onboarding Focus**: Emphasized the onboarding process and the use of AI/ML to score and qualify targets, aligning with the sales-like process.\n- **AI/ML & Category Expansion**: Highlighted your technical expertise in using AI/ML for SKU expansion and product data management, tying in your category mapping and feature mapping initiatives.\n- **Compliance & Pricing Algorithms**: Showcased AI/ML\u2019s role in pricing and compliance, illustrating your contributions to efficiency and profitability.\n\nThis version integrates your vendor onboarding and AI/ML expertise while maintaining the focus on growth, automation, and product expansion.
