    "So I did social media before for a tennis training site. I was following people that followed other tennis training handles or pros in hopes that they\u2019d follow back. Is that a good strategy? Who should I be following to both drive engagement and possible deals? Should I also be following accounts that post dog/animal content? I know you don\u2019t want to spam others posts with like your own videos, but a lot of them ask or imply that they want others to post? How can we drive follower count?"
