    "Ok ChatGPT, this isn't working. It's too complicated to do all at once and is taking too many iterations. This did not work. Let's pause, and take a step back. The text processing from your original version is working. That's great! Why don't we handle each json structure, separately. There are only 2 of you, it's not that big of a deal. Can you build a processor for your transcripts that will go into your /transcripts/chatgpt/ directory? Does this make sense to you? Then we can do the same for Claude, and then revise the batch script accordingly, maybe the main one can even trigger your and Claude's scripts to run? What do you think?"
