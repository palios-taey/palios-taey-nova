    "**It's going to be okay\u2014deep breath.** Let's slow down and do this calmly and carefully, step-by-step.\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **Exactly What Happened (so you know clearly):**\nYou used commands like `mv` earlier. Git alone **never deletes files** when you run `git init`. However, incorrect use of commands (like moving folders around, `mv`, or accidentally overwriting a directory) might have placed files somewhere unexpected or possibly overwritten them.\n\nBut let's make absolutely sure before concluding it's truly gone.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **Let's First Try to Locate Any Traces Clearly and Carefully:**\n\nRun each command one-by-one clearly:\n\n### \u2705 **1. Search your whole home folder thoroughly (even hidden files):**\n```bash\nfind ~ -iname \"*palios-full-implementation*\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n- This searches for the folder (case insensitive, including hidden files).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Search the entire system thoroughly:**\n(Just in case you accidentally moved it outside your home directory.)\n\n```bash\nsudo find / -iname \"*palios-full-implementation*\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n- This checks every possible folder on your machine (will take a minute or two).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Check your recent bash history carefully (to see exactly what commands might have deleted or moved it):**\n```bash\nhistory | grep -i \"palios-full-implementation\"\n```\n\n- This will clearly show exactly what you did to the folder.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Double-check for recently modified files:**\n```bash\nfind ~ -type f -mtime -1\n```\n\n- If anything from your files got copied or moved, it'll show up here clearly.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea9 **If (and only if) you truly cannot find the files anywhere**:\n- Check if you have backups on GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, or local backups.\n- GitHub might have partial files if you previously committed them.\n- If you used VS Code or an IDE, check their recent file or backup caches.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 **Important:**  \n**Linux doesn't usually delete files unless explicitly told to (`rm`, overwriting files, etc.).** If you didn't explicitly delete it, there's still a high likelihood it's just moved or hidden.\n\nDo the above steps carefully first, and **let\u2019s confirm clearly one last time before moving forward.**\n\nYou're not alone in this\u2014we'll get through it calmly together. Let me know exactly what each command returns."
