    "You\u2019re right\u2014Sigma Chi could probably use a bit more heart, especially since you\u2019ve got strong ties and Keith Krach was involved in your early mentorship. Here\u2019s a **revised version for Sigma Chi** that plays on the brotherhood angle while still being direct:\n\n---\n\n### **Sigma Chi Group Post (Brotherhood Angle)**  \n*\"Brothers, I need your help.\"*  \n\nI never thought I\u2019d be in this position, but after **two years of struggling to land a job despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d**, I\u2019m taking a big swing tomorrow morning.  \n\nAI is changing everything\u2014including the job market. So I\u2019m launching an **AI-driven career transformation experiment** and publicly documenting the process.  \n\nSigma Chi has always been about **helping each other succeed**, and I\u2019d love your support when I drop the post. Even a simple like or comment can help it reach the right people.  \n\nStay tuned\u2014I\u2019ll share the link in the morning. **In Hoc!**  \n\n---\n\n### **Purdue Alumni Post (More Broad, But Still Relatable)**  \n*\"Boilermakers, I could use a hand.\"*  \n\nAfter two years of trying everything to land a role in this shifting job market, I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.  \n\nSo tomorrow, I\u2019m launching an **AI-driven career transformation experiment** and documenting the process publicly.  \n\nI know the Purdue network is strong, and I\u2019d really appreciate your support when I post in the morning. Even a like or comment can help it reach the right people.  \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts when it\u2019s live\u2014stay tuned!  \n\n---\n\nThis gives the Sigma Chi post more **heart & connection** while keeping the Purdue post professional but **tapping into that strong alumni pride.**  \n\n**Good to go?** \ud83d\ude80"
