    "Yes, we agreed that the **Master Tag System** would be refined as we go, so we\u2019ll create initial tags based on what we know now, then expand dynamically as more insights are added.  \n\n### **Immediate Actions Before Connecting AI:**  \n\u2705 **Manually create & test a few core tags** for consistency (e.g., AI Strategy, Career, Automation, Fitness, Chewy, Finance).  \n\u2705 **Input a few key insights into Notion** \u2013 These should be high-priority insights so we can test retrieval.  \n\u2705 **Confirm database linking works as expected** \u2013 Ensure relations between PKD, AI Influencers, Goals, and AI Workflows are intact.  \n\nOnce this is done, we move to **Step 2: API & Retrieval Setup.** Let me know when ready!"
