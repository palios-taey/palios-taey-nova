    "In Oracle, **SQL tuning** is often referred to using terms like **SQL Optimization** or **SQL Performance Tuning**. Oracle provides several tools and techniques under this broader concept:\n\n1. **Oracle SQL Tuning Advisor**: This is a built-in tool that automatically analyzes SQL statements and provides recommendations for performance improvements, such as creating indexes or restructuring the query.\n\n2. **Oracle Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)**: ADDM helps identify performance bottlenecks, including SQL-related issues, and provides tuning recommendations.\n\n3. **Oracle Optimizer**: The **Oracle Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)** is responsible for determining the most efficient execution plan for a SQL statement based on various factors, such as statistics, indexes, and system configuration.\n\n4. **SQL Plan Baselines**: This is an Oracle feature that captures and uses historical SQL execution plans to prevent SQL performance regression.\n\nIn Oracle documentation or performance tuning contexts, you\u2019ll hear about **SQL tuning**, **optimizer hints**, **query optimization**, and **execution plan tuning**, but the overall term is **SQL performance tuning** or **SQL optimization**.\n\nThese terms all refer to strategies and tools that improve how SQL queries perform in the Oracle Database environment."
