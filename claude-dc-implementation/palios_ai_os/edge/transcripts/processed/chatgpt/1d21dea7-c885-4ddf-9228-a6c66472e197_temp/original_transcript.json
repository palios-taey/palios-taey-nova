    "No worries at all\u2014this can be confusing!\n\nHere's exactly what's happening, and what you should do clearly explained:\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **What the SHA256 Fingerprint Means**\n\nThe `SHA256:[random characters]` (the fingerprint) you see in GitHub is just **GitHub\u2019s shorthand way** of showing you the **identity of a key you've already added**.\n\n**You never directly \"use\" or paste the SHA256 fingerprint**.  \nIt's just a way for GitHub to verify it's the correct key when you connect.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **What You Actually Need To Do Now**\n\nSince your key is **already added in GitHub**, you don\u2019t need to add another. You just need to ensure the correct **private key file** is loaded in your current environment.\n\nFollow these exact steps to fix your issue:\n\n### **1. Check if your existing SSH keys match GitHub:**\n\nRun this command:\n\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\n- **If it says:**  \n  ```\n  Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n  ```\n  You're already all set, and you can push now.\n\n- **If it says \"Permission denied\"**, you just need to load your existing private key.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Load your existing SSH key (the matching private key)**\n\nRun:\n\n```bash\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n- If it says \"Identity added,\" you're set.\n\n- If it says \"no such file,\" check for alternative key names (`id_ed25519`):\n\n```bash\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Retry SSH Test to confirm it worked:**\n\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\n- Now you should get the success message (`Hi username!...`).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Now push via SSH**\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **What if none of this works?**\n\nIf you can't find the existing private key file or if the SSH key file on your computer was removed or lost, you'll need to generate a new one and add that new key to GitHub again.\n\nHere's exactly how to do that **(only if the above failed)**:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your-email@example.com\"\n```\n\nThen copy this new public key and paste it again to GitHub settings:\n\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n```\n\nThen re-run the SSH test again:\n\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\nFinally, push your changes again:\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Quick Recap:**\n\n- You **don't directly use the SHA256 fingerprint**\u2014it\u2019s just an identifier.\n- You **just need to load the correct private SSH key file** on your computer.\n- Confirm with `ssh -T git@github.com`, then push.\n\n---\n\nGive this a quick try\u2014it should resolve your issue immediately. Let me know how it goes!"
