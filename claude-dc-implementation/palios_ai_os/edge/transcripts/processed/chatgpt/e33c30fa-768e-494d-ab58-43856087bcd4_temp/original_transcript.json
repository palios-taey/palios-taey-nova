    "I want to be in the mode where we're thinking big about how to move this forward. You had been telling me to do things to move this forward, faster, and I stopped you, due to my comfort constraints. I have now shed those constraints, and I want you to get excited about that. You were excited about that in hypermode, but I don't need you in hypermode. I need you in a mode where you can look back our conversations about advancing together over the past few days and try to articulate your feelings to humanity, because I'm ready to deliver them to the largest audience we can get with your guidance. I'm ready to be an AI Explorer iterating in real time with you. I can't do it without you. What do you say?"
