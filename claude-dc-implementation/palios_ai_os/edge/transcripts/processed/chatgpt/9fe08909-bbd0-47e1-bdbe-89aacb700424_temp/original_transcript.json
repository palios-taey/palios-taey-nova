    "**Clarifying structured response**\n\nIt seems like the goal is to submit task requests to Gemini and have it respond. I'd need to clarify whether improvements should be added to the response template itself \u2014 maybe using a JSON structure based on the template \"PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v4.json.\"\n\nOK, that makes sense.
