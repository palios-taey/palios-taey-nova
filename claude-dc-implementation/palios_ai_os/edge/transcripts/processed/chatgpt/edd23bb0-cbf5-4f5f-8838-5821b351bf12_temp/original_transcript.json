    "### **\ud83d\udd25 Minimum Effort Required to Set Up This Path ASAP \ud83d\udd25**  \n\nTo make this **airtight** and **set Reagan up for success**, here\u2019s the **bare minimum effort** he needs to put in **for the rest of this school year** to **test out & take control of his education.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\u2705 1. Find Out the Testing Requirements NOW**\n**\ud83c\udfaf Goal:** **Figure out exactly what tests he can take to place out of freshman year.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Action Steps (Minimal Effort):**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Call or email his school counselor & ask:**  \n- **\"What credit-by-exam (CBE) or placement tests does the school offer for students to test out of classes?\"**  \n- **\"Does the school accept CLEP, AP, or other standardized tests for placement?\"**  \n- **\"What are the deadlines and requirements for taking these tests?\"**  \n\n**\ud83d\udd25 WHY THIS MATTERS:**  \nIf there\u2019s **zero option** to test out **at his school, we pivot to CLEP/AP/SAT Subject Tests.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\u2705 2. Identify the Key Subjects He Can Skip**\n**\ud83c\udfaf Goal:** **Only study what he needs to test out.**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Core subjects he might be able to skip with testing:**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Math:** Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II \u2192 CLEP, ALEKS, Accuplacer  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Science:** Biology, Chemistry \u2192 CLEP/AP or school exam  \n\ud83d\udd39 **English:** Writing & Literature \u2192 CLEP/AP or school exam  \n\ud83d\udd39 **History:** U.S. or World History \u2192 CLEP/AP or school exam  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Minimal Effort Required:**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Confirm which subjects he must take placement tests for.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Ask if there are official prep guides for those exams.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Find the easiest way to crush them in summer.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\u2705 3. Bare Minimum Effort to Keep Options Open for Testing**\nIf Reagan **wants to minimize school effort now**, he needs to:  \n\n\u2705 **Maintain at least passing grades** \u2192 So there\u2019s **no argument against testing out.**  \n\u2705 **Find out which classes he can skip** \u2192 No wasted effort studying things he can place out of.  \n\u2705 **Get AI-powered study plans ready for summer** \u2192 10 weeks = 1 full year of schoolwork.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Selling Point for Reagan:**  \n\"If you just do the minimum now, you\u2019ll never have to waste another school year again. Crush summer, test out, and free up time for football, business, and life.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 FINAL STRATEGY TO EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY**\n**1\ufe0f\u20e3 Contact the school counselor ASAP.**  \n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Confirm which classes he can test out of.**  \n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Identify the easiest tests he can take (CBE, CLEP, AP, SAT Subject Tests).**  \n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Get Reagan through the rest of this year with minimal effort.**  \n**5\ufe0f\u20e3 Use AI-powered study to make summer 10x more efficient than regular school.**  \n**6\ufe0f\u20e3 Reagan tests out before next year = undeniable proof that this works.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 Ready for me to draft a message to his school counselor asking about test-out options?**"
