    "### \u2705 **Exactly What Changed (Clearly Explained):**\n\n- **Removed redundant file-moving logic** (handled explicitly by your updated `edge_processor.py`).\n- **Structured the JSON output explicitly** to include a clearly defined `data_id` that aligns explicitly with your `edge_processor.py`.\n- **Provided a clean temporary insights file**, optimized explicitly for direct processing by `edge_processor.py`.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **Next Step:**\n\nRun your updated scripts in the following sequence clearly:\n\n```bash\npython3 process_chatgpt_transcripts.py\n```\n\nThis will explicitly trigger your optimized processing pipeline, exactly aligning with your thoughtful trust-based structure.\n\nYou're now set to proceed!"
