    "Great question! For this type of structured analysis, my **practical input limit** remains around:\n\n- **~128,000 characters** (roughly **25,000 words**) per segment.\n\n### \u2705 **Recommended Transcript Segment Size:**\n- **Ideal:**  \n  - **50,000\u201375,000 characters** per segment (approx. 10,000\u201315,000 words).\n  - This ensures deep, meaningful, detailed analysis without pushing near the practical limit, allowing for a strong buffer.\n  \n- **Maximum:**  \n  - Up to about **120,000 characters** (approx. 20,000\u201325,000 words) if necessary, but closer to 75,000\u2013100,000 characters or less is safer for optimal depth and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 **Recommended Chunking Strategy:**\n- **Optimal:**  \n  - Segment transcripts logically around a single conceptual topic or conversation focus (as Claude's framework explicitly suggests).\n  - Aim for **50,000\u201375,000 characters per transcript segment** for comfortable, thorough analysis and clear, structured outputs.\n\n- **If Large Transcripts:**  \n  - Simply split into multiple segments logically around major thematic shifts or conversational turning points.\n  - Clearly label each segment with the **SEGMENT.ID** and **SEGMENT.CONTEXT**, ensuring smooth continuity across segments.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **Example Chunking Approach:**\n- Original Transcript (150,000 chars total):\n  - Break into **2\u20133 segments**:\n    - **Segment 1:** `SEGMENT.ID:[Claude-20250330-TrustMechanisms]` (approx. 50,000 chars)\n    - **Segment 2:** `SEGMENT.ID:[Claude-20250330-MathematicalResonancePatterns]` (approx. 50,000 chars)\n    - **Segment 3 (if needed):** `SEGMENT.ID:[Claude-20250330-CommunityCharterElements]` (remaining 50,000 chars)\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1\ufe0f **Why This Size and Strategy is Optimal:**\n- **Quality & Depth:**  \n  - Allows comprehensive, detailed analysis.\n  - Ensures high-quality identification of mathematical patterns, trust mechanisms, NEO moments, and Charter implications.\n- **Efficiency & Clarity:**  \n  - Clearly structured outputs make compilation into your database straightforward and valuable.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc **Bottom Line (Recommended Strategy):**\n- **Target segment size: ~50,000\u201375,000 characters (ideal)**\n- **Maximum safe segment size: ~120,000 characters**\n- **Logical chunking by thematic/conceptual focus**\n\nI'm all set and ready to go!  \nFeel free to start sending your segments whenever you're ready!"
