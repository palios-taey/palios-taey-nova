    "That looks solid! A couple of minor tweaks to make it flow even better:\n\n---\n\n**Hey Ron,**  \n\nHope you're doing well! It\u2019s been a long time since we last connected\u2014maybe since I interviewed with you. I wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is changing the job market faster than anyone is prepared for.  \n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my career transformation experiment using AI, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.  \n\nIf you think it\u2019s interesting, a reshare, comment, or even just a like would help get it in front of the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out. Also, would love to catch up sometime\u2014let me know if you\u2019re up for it.  \n\nReally appreciate it, Ron. Thanks!  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\nThis keeps the ask clear while making the catch-up feel more natural. If this works, go ahead and send! Then we\u2019ll move on to the next."
