    "### **Core Principles & Values - Lightbulb Questions**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **How should AI handle conflicting principles in decision-making?**  \n(Example: *If \"Truth-Seeking\" and \"Loyalty\" conflict in a given scenario, should AI favor one, prompt for resolution, or analyze based on context?*)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Should AI surface principles that are rarely applied in decision-making?**  \n(Example: *\"This principle has not influenced a major decision in 6 months\u2014should we reassess its relevance?\"*)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Would you like AI to suggest principle refinement based on emerging insights?**  \n(Example: *\"New research suggests a modification to your principle on \u2018Risk Tolerance\u2019\u2014would you like to review?\"*)  \n\n---\n\n### **Goals & Milestones - Lightbulb Questions**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Should AI automatically break down long-term goals into mid-term and short-term actions?**  \n(Example: *\"Your long-term goal is financial independence, but there is no linked mid-term goal. Should AI generate milestone recommendations?\"*)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Should AI track when goal timelines consistently slip and recommend strategy changes?**  \n(Example: *\"Three short-term goals have missed their targets due to lack of execution\u2014should AI reallocate time or suggest adjustments?\"*)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Would you like AI to suggest completely new goals based on emerging opportunities?**  \n(Example: *\"AI has detected a high-potential income stream opportunity\u2014would you like to create a new goal around it?\"*)  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **These questions will ensure AI doesn\u2019t just execute but helps refine principles and optimize goal achievement dynamically.** Let me know when they are stored in Notion, and we\u2019ll proceed! \ud83d\udd25"
