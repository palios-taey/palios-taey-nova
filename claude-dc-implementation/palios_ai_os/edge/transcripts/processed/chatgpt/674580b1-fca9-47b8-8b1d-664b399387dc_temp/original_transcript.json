    "Let's begin by setting up your environment and preparing the basic components for the Gemini Pro API integration. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Environment Preparation & Library Installation**\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries:**  \n   Ensure your Cloud Function environment has the necessary Python packages. In addition to your current dependencies (like the `openai` library), install the `requests` library (unless you already have it) to handle HTTP requests.  \n   **Command:**  \n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n   *Verify that the installation completes without errors.*\n\n2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**  \n   Securely store your Gemini Pro API key as an environment variable. For Google Cloud Functions, this is typically done via the Cloud Console or using a configuration file (like `.env` for local testing).  \n   **Example:**  \n   ```bash\n   export GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY=\"your_gemini_pro_api_key_here\"\n   ```\n   *Double-check that the API key is correctly set in your deployment environment.*\n\n3. **Confirm Environment Setup:**  \n   - Open a terminal or use your Cloud Function's logging feature to print the environment variable for a quick verification (remember to remove sensitive information immediately after testing).  \n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(\"Gemini Pro API Key Loaded:\", bool(os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY\")))\n   ```\n   *This should output `True` if the API key is correctly loaded.*\n\n---\n\n### **Next Step: Let\u2019s Validate Your Environment**\n\nBefore proceeding with the API integration code, please complete these environment setup tasks. Once confirmed, let me know, and we'll move on to initializing the Gemini Pro API client and writing a test query.\n\nDo you have your environment set up according to these instructions? Let me know if everything is clear or if you need further guidance on this step."
