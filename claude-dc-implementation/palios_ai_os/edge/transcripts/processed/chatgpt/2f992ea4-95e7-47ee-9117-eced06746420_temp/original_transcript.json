    "Here\u2019s a revised version with a more personal tone while keeping the key points intact:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Following Up on the Director of Sales Role\n\nHi [Hiring Manager\u2019s Name],\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to quickly check in on the Director of Sales role and see if there are any updates or if you have any further questions about my candidacy.\n\nI understand that a strong network is valuable, and while I may not have an extensive list of contacts right now, I\u2019ve always been resourceful and creative in finding ways to open doors. Throughout my career, I\u2019ve successfully built relationships and driven results from the ground up\u2014whether through research, cold outreach, or finding new avenues to connect with key decision-makers.\n\nI\u2019m confident that with my hard work, strategic approach, and determination, I can bring real value to Lily AI. I\u2019d love to discuss how I can help move things forward.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nThis version sounds more human and conversational while still addressing the concern and reinforcing your strengths."
