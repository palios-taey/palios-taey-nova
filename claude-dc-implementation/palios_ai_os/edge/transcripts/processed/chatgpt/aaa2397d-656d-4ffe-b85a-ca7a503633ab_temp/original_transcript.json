    "So I think this is largely on target, I guess I'll just put the synopsis of my career/education below here for you to ingest and adjust accordingly. This is really more about positioning me for the jobs that I am most likely to get and to be honest, I don't really know what that is so need your feedback and thoughts on that. \n\nEducationally at Purdue Engineering Management was basically an Industrial Engineering degree without the final project. I also got an industrial management degree. I had significant advanced leadership opportunities through my fraternity, Sigma Chi, where I had an exceptional network coming out of school of top execs and leaders, like Keith Krach came to my wedding in 2009. \n\nFirst job at Caterpillar Logistics Services. Started out as support staff for a facility we were managing for bombardier aerospace, it was a startup facility so was a mess. I eventually was supervising 7 shifts and worked 16 hour days for a month straight at one point. I did excellent there managing the lines, driving efficiencies through 6 sigma and lean processes. Learning Lean and 6 sigma were really important as they have been what I've used throughout my career on process improvement. I think this is one of my greatest strength is being able to go into pretty much any process at any company and figure out how to make it more effective, or eliminate entirely through automation.\n\nThen I left and went to Home Depot where I got put into a role in store operations at HQ managing waste and recycling at the stores. Had no experience, but through analyzing data and developing new recycling programs, I saved a ton a money and won awards for it.\n\nI then went to Kraft Group, Rand Whitney Recycling where I did national accounts. I was supposed to be pitching to companies like home depot and runnning the national accounts we had, but it wasn't a good fit, so I left to start my own consulting company, ESE Solutions. Details are in resumes I've submitted. Lots of data driven efforts there. First was on waste management where I did analysis of current utilization, did audits to determine actual utilization and trash composition and then ran RFP to get new pricing for right sized service that saved 80%. I developed invoice processing technology that drove the cost down to around a dollar an invoice from 12. It was pretty cool, invoices were sent to bulk mail processor, loaded into a custom web portal for outsourced workers to enter and it audited them and everything. I also did a vendor compliance program for them that included determining costs of various issues and developing software to process all the data, send out violations, revised the vendor contracts, etc. I did work for RILA on a compliance portal which was basically an early machine learning application of training a model to identify and categorize regulations at the state level for retailers\n\nI had to shut that down due to divorce. I was planning to get out of it and was trying to find new web based business. I tried to do a site for intern recruitment, Interns365, but new Obama regulations made interns less popular and it was too expensive to aquire customers without SEO. I bought a tennis website, optimumtennis.net and really learned SEO and grew the site from 50K unique users to over 100K in a few months. I got divorced and had no money to invest so I stopped that eventually.\n\nI got a job at OJCommerce by meeting the CTO through pre-school and the owner liked my process improvement experience, so gave me a shot at GM. I did very well there as from resume and ran many data related projects which we've also discussed, I think primarily in the Lily AI resume. \n\nI got into commerceHub because they had an opening for someone to build/run a marketplace seller business, but they decided not to move forward with that so created a role for me that was just basically find something cool to do. results are in there, also very data focused and cross functional\n\nAnd last mirakl where they also created a position for me after i interviewed for another role to revamp their dropship platform. i was hired in may, told in august my job was in jeopardy and that a decision would be made on drop ship in october, worked hard to get a big plan and investment improved, was offered a promotion, had it rescinded and was laid off a couple weeks later along with 25% of US workforce. \n\nSo that is my story, not sure if it changes anything with the additional context, but again, very focused on marketing myself in a manner that is targeted toward jobs I am likely to get or at least get interviews for. The last couple applications for stretch roles, like sales enablement and partnerships haven't gone so well I think because my resume/titles don't neccessarily align perfectly and there are lots that do. i think the best fit for me is probably roles that are like operational excellence centers and some of the operations ones you have above. I don't know if there are a lot of those roles though, so that's where the marketability comes in. \n\nQuite frankly, it doesn't seem like I'm marketable at all, given that I've been unemployed this long, so looking for this to be super dialed in on achieving obtainable roles, whatever those are.\n\nI got into OJCommerce because\n\n"
