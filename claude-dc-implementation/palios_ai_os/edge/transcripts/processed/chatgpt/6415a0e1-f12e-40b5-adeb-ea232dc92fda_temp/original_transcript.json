    "Thanks ChatGPT. You didn't really review the attachment at all and just tried to infer what was in it based on my prompt. It's OK, I can recognize these things now and understand it is just because the chat is too long now. Can you provide any guidance on how to best utilize Project level features you have? You have places for attachments and for instructions. Can you review the Dense Strategic Summary for New Chat (Claude DC Integration) you provided and advise how I should populate the Project Instructions? Also let me know if it makes sense to include the cache files as attachments in the Project. "
