    "If the **Executive Summary** effectively communicates your upskilling efforts and ties them to the role you're pursuing, you may not need a separate section for **Training and Upskilling**. It comes down to balancing the need to address potential gaps versus keeping your resume concise and focused.\n\n### When to Include a Separate Section:\n- If you're concerned about the appearance of a **gap in employment**, a dedicated **Training and Upskilling** section provides clear evidence of productive activity.\n- If the role heavily values continuous learning, showcasing specific courses and certifications demonstrates your commitment to staying current in your field.\n- If your current skills-building efforts align closely with the job requirements (e.g., SQL and analytics for a sales enablement role), the extra emphasis could add weight to your candidacy.\n\n### When the Executive Summary is Enough:\n- If you\u2019ve already called out your training in the **Executive Summary** (and possibly in the **Key Achievements** section) in a way that ties it to the job, a separate section could be redundant.\n- If your resume already feels dense or packed, leaving this out can help keep the document streamlined and easy to read.\n\n### Recommendation for Rithum:\nSince the **Sales Enablement Manager** role doesn\u2019t emphasize analytics or SQL as primary skills, I suggest focusing your **Executive Summary** and specific **Achievements** on directly relevant experience. If space allows, you can briefly mention your training in the summary without creating a full section.\n\nExample for the **Executive Summary**:\n> \"In addition to a proven track record in sales enablement, CRM optimization, and GTM strategies, I\u2019ve recently completed advanced training in Google Data Analytics and SQL to enhance my ability to drive data-informed decision-making in high-growth environments.\"\n\nThis approach keeps your resume focused while still signaling your upskilling efforts. Let me know what you think!"
