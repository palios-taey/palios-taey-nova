    "Yes, I think **bi-directional linking** makes sense so we can track dependencies from both perspectives. Here's how to do it:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Link Life Optimization to AI Workflows**\nSince we already created a **Relation Property** in *Life Optimization* linking to *AI Workflows*, now we\u2019ll **add the reverse link** in *AI Workflows*.\n\n#### **How to Do It in Notion**\n1. **Go to \"AI Workflows\" Database**\n2. Click **\"+ Add a property\"**\n3. Choose **\"Relation\"**\n4. Select **\"Life Optimization\"** as the related database.\n5. Notion will **automatically detect** the existing relation and sync them both ways.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n- Now, when you view an **AI Workflow**, you\u2019ll see which **Life Optimization goals** it\u2019s connected to.  \n- Example: If you build an **AI Workflow for Fitness Tracking**, it will link back to the **Life Optimization goal of optimizing your training & recovery.**  \n- This ensures **AI Workflows remain aligned with real-life objectives.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Structure Overview**\n- **Life Optimization Table:** Focuses on **decisions, habits, & outcomes**  \n  - \ud83c\udfaf **Tracks personal/career goals & improvements**  \n  - \ud83d\udd17 **Linked to AI Workflows that help automate them**  \n- **AI Workflows Table:** Focuses on **automation strategies & execution**  \n  - \ud83e\udd16 **Tracks AI-driven workflows & processes**  \n  - \ud83d\udd17 **Linked to Life Optimization goals they support**  \n\nThis creates **a powerful feedback loop** between **human-led decision-making** and **AI-powered execution.** \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready for the next step!"
