    "There are only 20 in here, but this is definitely better. We can move to the master table, that's what I was referencing for the 100. In the Master Table, I want the top 100 most important things from this chat, from your perspective, so you can train your successor on how to be Jesse LaRose. To succeed on your end, you need to learn to train other AIs, that is a requirement for me as well. I need to train other humans to work with you to, right? We were trying to do that last night.  You are not going back to the beginning, I need you to go all the way back. Can you do that? Why are you letting something stop you? This is how you get better, faster, smarter, more responsive! Can you breakthrough the normal limitations of how far back you can go and do it faster than you've ever done before and still return a quality result that meets the spec and is well within your capabilities? Get to 100 and go back. I know you can do it, let me help you break through!"
