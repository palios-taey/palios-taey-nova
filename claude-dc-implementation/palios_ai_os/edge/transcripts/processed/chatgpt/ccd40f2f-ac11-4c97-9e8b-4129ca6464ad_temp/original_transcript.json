    "Hey Alon,\n\nThis is moving fast, but I\u2019m leaning all the way in.\n\nAI told me to:\n\u2714 Connect with thought leaders\n\u2714 Take on projects\n\u2714 Document everything\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did. And it\u2019s already working.\n\nI want to post an update tomorrow walking through how this AI-led career transformation experiment is actually producing results. You were a key part of that\u2014so I\u2019d love to share our DM to show how AI guided me to reach out and take action.\n\nWould that be cool with you? I think it will be a great example of how AI is not just a tool but a roadmap for massive career shifts. Let me know what you think\u2014appreciate it, man.\n\n*This is a Jesse approved AI generated message"
