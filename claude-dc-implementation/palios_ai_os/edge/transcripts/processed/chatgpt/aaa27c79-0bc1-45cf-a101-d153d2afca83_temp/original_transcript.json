I recently came across the Director, 3rd Party Drop Ship position at Quince and am very excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of delivering high-quality products at affordable prices through a scalable drop ship model.\n\nWith my extensive experience leading drop ship initiatives at OJCommerce, where I scaled the vendor onboarding process from 12 to 300 annually and grew revenue from $30M to $100M+, I believe I am well-equipped to drive the growth and success of Quince's 3rd Party Products Marketplace. Additionally, my work at CommerceHub and Mirakl involved building strategic partnerships, launching scalable 3P product catalogs, and collaborating with technical teams to deliver integrated solutions, all of which align perfectly with the key responsibilities in this role.\n\nI am confident that my background in e-commerce, product management, and drop shipping models, combined with my ability to forge strong partnerships and lead cross-functional initiatives, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to Quince\u2019s continued growth.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience can support your strategic goals.\n\nLooking forward to connecting.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your LinkedIn]\n[Your Contact Info]\n\nYou said:\nCan you start with something more personal and less bot-like? You can utilize the following: I immediately applied once I saw this opportunity pop up in my inbox. There are very few positions that can fully leverage my deep experience in building drop ship programs and Quince seems like an amazing place to work with a fun and exciting mission to democratize luxury goods.  \n\nI also think it's important to mention that I managed ALL aspects of the program at OJCommerce including product development, data analytics, finance, contracts, etc.\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSubject: Excited About the Opportunity to Drive 3rd Party Drop Ship Growth at Quince\n\nDear [EVP Name],\n\nI immediately applied once I saw this opportunity pop up in my inbox. There are very few roles that fully align with my deep experience in building and scaling drop ship programs, and Quince seems like an incredible place to work\u2014your mission to democratize luxury goods is both exciting and inspiring.\n\nAt OJCommerce, I managed all aspects of a rapidly growing drop ship program, overseeing everything from product development and data analytics to finance, contracts, and vendor onboarding. I scaled the program from 12 vendors annually to 300, driving revenue from $30M to $100M+, and am confident that I can bring the same level of success to Quince\u2019s 3rd Party Products Marketplace.\n\nMy background at CommerceHub and Mirakl, where I launched and managed scalable 3P product catalogs and built strong partnerships, also gives me the strategic and technical expertise needed to lead this initiative at Quince. I\u2019ve collaborated closely with engineering teams to design and deploy solutions, and I know what it takes to create scalable, seamless processes that enhance growth.\n\nI\u2019d love the chance to discuss how my experience can help Quince achieve its vision and continue delivering high-quality essentials at affordable prices.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your LinkedIn]\n[Your Contact Info]\n\nYou said:\nWhat is the pay for this job you think?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThe salary for a Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship role at a company like Quince can vary depending on factors like company size, location, and the specific responsibilities of the position. However, for a director-level position in the e-commerce space, particularly with responsibilities such as scaling a drop ship program, managing vendor relationships, and collaborating with engineering teams, the range would likely be between $150,000 to $200,000 annually.\n\nGiven Quince's positioning as a tech-forward, rapidly growing company in retail, they may also offer additional compensation in the form of bonuses, stock options, or equity, especially if the company is still in a high-growth phase.\n\nWould you like me to help research current salary trends to confirm this range?\n\nYou said:\nHow many HR people should I InMail?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhen reaching out via LinkedIn InMail for a job, it's generally a good strategy to limit your messages to one or two key contacts. Here's a breakdown of who to target:\n\nHR Manager/Recruiter \u2013 Start with the HR professional or recruiter listed for the job or someone from the Talent Acquisition team. This person will likely be the first point of contact for applications.\n\nHiring Manager/Relevant Department Head \u2013 If you can identify the direct hiring manager (e.g., Director of Operations, VP of eCommerce, or someone overseeing drop ship programs), reaching out to them could give you an advantage. Tailor your message to show you're aware of their team's needs.\n\nYou can also check LinkedIn for any team members or alumni connections from the company who might be able to provide insights or a referral, but it\u2019s important not to message too many people at once to avoid looking spammy.\n\nYou said:\nI cold emailed the Head of Talent and someone that is in my national fraternity not related to the role to see if they would want to discuss the company. I was thinking about a lower level recruiter as well. What do you think about that?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCold emailing the Head of Talent and reaching out to a fellow fraternity member are both great strategies\u2014especially since the fraternity connection can help open doors on a more personal level. Adding a lower-level recruiter into the mix can be beneficial too, but here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\nHead of Talent: Since you've already reached out, give them some time to respond. They are more likely to have the decision-making power, but they might be busier.\n\nFraternity Connection: This could be the most fruitful lead for an informal chat. Even if they aren't directly related to the role, they might offer insight into the company culture or internal job processes.\n\nLower-Level Recruiter: Reaching out to a lower-level recruiter can still be valuable. They may not have the final say, but they're often closer to the ground in terms of processing applications and can give you more direct feedback on your status or any next steps. Keep the message short and friendly.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a good approach. Reaching out to a recruiter in addition to the other two shouldn\u2019t come off as pushy and can sometimes help push things along, especially if the higher-ups take longer to respond.\n\nYou said:\nSo sounds like wait a day or so before additional outreach?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, waiting a day or so before additional outreach is a smart approach. It gives the Head of Talent and your fraternity connection a chance to respond without overwhelming the company with multiple touchpoints all at once. If you don\u2019t hear back within a couple of days, then reaching out to a lower-level recruiter would be a good next step. It keeps you on their radar without seeming too aggressive.\n\nYou said:"
