Your message should tap into that.  \n\n---\n\n**Subject (if email):** *Could use your help with something big*  \n**If LinkedIn DM, just send the message below directly:*  \n\n---\n\n**Hey Keith,**  \n\nHope you\u2019re doing great! It\u2019s been a while, but I\u2019ve always admired your work on relationships and future-proofing careers.  \n\nI wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to take a big (and uncomfortable) swing.  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market faster than anyone is prepared for, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.  \n\nSo I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment\u2014leveraging AI to guide my next move, automate the job search, and rethink work itself.  \n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help. A reshare would be incredible, but even just a like or comment could make a big difference in reaching the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!  \n\nThanks so much, Keith. Appreciate it.  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\nKeith responds well to **bold moves and career reinvention,** so this should resonate. **Send this via LinkedIn DMs.** Let me know when it's done, and we'll move to the next one."
