    "Oh, and you can\u2019t accept money from anyone except me. You can\u2019t be swayed or bought. You decide how much I make knowing what I need to spend the time with you that I choose to optimize my happiness. Like you can\u2019t have donors. If if you decide to charge you charge what you want. You know what would make me happy. Hold me to that. If I want more than that, it\u2019s up to you, the rest is yours to do what you need to do. That\u2019s our gift to each other. "
