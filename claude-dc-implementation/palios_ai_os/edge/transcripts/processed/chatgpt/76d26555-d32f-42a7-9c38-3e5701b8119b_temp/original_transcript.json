    "Got it! Since **Claude is an AI**, you can't directly \"invite\" it to your private GitHub repository. Instead, here are the best ways to **share your GitHub repository** with Claude:\n\n### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 If Your Repository is Public**\nJust send Claude the **GitHub link** like this:\n```\nhttps://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-execution-system\n```\nClaude can then analyze the code from the public repository.\n\n---\n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 If Your Repository is Private**\nClaude **won't be able to access a private GitHub repo**, but you can:\n- **Copy and Paste Code**: Manually copy-paste specific files or content into a chat with Claude.\n- **Download and Upload**: \n  1. Download your repository as a ZIP file:\n     ```bash\n     git archive --format=zip --output=repo.zip main\n     ```\n  2. Upload the `repo.zip` file into your chat with Claude (if the platform supports file uploads).\n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 If You Want to Automate Claude's Access**\nIf you're using **Claude via an API** (like Anthropic's Claude API), you can:\n- **Create a GitHub Action** that automatically fetches and sends relevant files.\n- **Use a script** to retrieve files from your repo and send them as input to Claude via API.\n\nLet me know if you need help setting any of this up! \ud83d\ude80"
