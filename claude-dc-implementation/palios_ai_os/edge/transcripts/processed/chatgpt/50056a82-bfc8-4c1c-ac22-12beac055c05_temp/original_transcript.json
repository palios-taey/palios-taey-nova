    "Yes, the behavior you're describing\u2014where files seem to disappear or get deleted after processing\u2014is due to the **explicitly implemented file-moving operation** in your updated `edge_processor.py`.\n\nHere's what's explicitly happening in your setup:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd **Explicit Reason Clearly Explained:**\n\nIn your latest `edge_processor.py`, you have the following snippet explicitly at the end of your script:\n\n```python\n# Move original file explicitly into processed folder (preserving history)\noriginal_transcript_dest = processed_dir / 'original_transcript.json'\nshutil.move(file_path, original_transcript_dest)\n```\n\n### **Exactly what this does clearly:**\n\n- After each transcript file is processed, it explicitly **moves** (not copies) the original transcript JSON from its current location (`./transcripts/chatgpt/`) into the explicitly structured folder in:\n  ```\n  ./transcripts/processed/chatgpt/[conversation_id]/original_transcript.json\n  ```\n\nThis explicitly ensures that each file is processed exactly **once**, clearly preserving historical context and preventing duplicate processing. However, it also means **original transcript files are removed** from the original location after being processed.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Why This Behavior is Intentional and Thoughtful:**\n\n- Clearly avoids repeated processing of the same file.\n- Explicitly preserves your historical transparency, traceability, and data integrity as per your stated intention.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **Your Options Clearly Stated:**\n\n### **Option 1 (Recommended):**  \n- Keep the current behavior (moving files explicitly), recognizing files will disappear from the original folder after processing.\n\n### **Option 2 (Alternative, if desired):**  \n- Explicitly **copy** instead of moving files if you prefer to keep originals intact in the source folder.\n\n**To clearly implement Option 2 (copy, not move)**:\nSimply replace this existing line in your `edge_processor.py`:\n\n```python\nshutil.move(file_path, original_transcript_dest)\n```\n\n**with explicitly this line:**\n\n```python\nshutil.copy(file_path, original_transcript_dest)\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea6 **Your Next Immediate Action Clearly Recommended:**\n\n- **Keep** (default, recommended) to maintain explicit history and processing clarity.\n- **Or Change** (copy explicitly) if you prefer explicitly retaining the original file copies in place.\n\nClearly let me know which behavior explicitly aligns best with your intentions, and I'll support you immediately!"
