    "This looks like a **drop shipping scam** or at best a **low-quality influencer marketing scheme** where they make money off the shipping fees while sending you cheap or non-existent products.  \n\nHere\u2019s why this is a **red flag:**  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **They\u2019re asking you to pay for shipping** \u2013 Legitimate brand ambassador programs don\u2019t make you pay for anything upfront.  \n\ud83d\udea8 **No real brand presence** \u2013 The company doesn\u2019t seem reputable or well-known.  \n\ud83d\udea8 **Suspicious referral structure** \u2013 They want you to recruit others with a referral code, which often means a **pyramid-style commission scheme**.  \n\ud83d\udea8 **No contract, just a DM pitch** \u2013 Real ambassador programs have agreements/contracts, not random messages asking you to buy something first.  \n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 What You Should Do Instead:**  \n\u2705 **Ignore & don\u2019t engage.** These programs prey on small influencers.  \n\u2705 **If interested in brand deals, target real pet brands.**  \n\u2705 **Consider reaching out to known brands yourself** (BarkBox, The Dodo, Chewy.com, etc.).  \n\u2705 **Build organic reach first** before worrying about sponsorships.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **If Chewy gains traction, legit brands will come to you.** Focus on content & growth first, and avoid wasting time on these kinds of offers."
