    "It worked! No errors. Great job ChatGPT! This is a great natural stopping point as I'm about to go to the beach to get Chewy some exercise with Reagan. Can you provide an update to Claude Chat about all the changes we made, why, etc so he knows what happened and can communicate anything needed to Claude DC?\n\nThis little sprint started with the prompt beginning with: \"ChatGPT, Claude Chat hit a limit and is unavailable. We were getting things set up and then planning to work with you as well once we understood it better, but this limit happened.\" if that helps you review back to the right place in our chat."
