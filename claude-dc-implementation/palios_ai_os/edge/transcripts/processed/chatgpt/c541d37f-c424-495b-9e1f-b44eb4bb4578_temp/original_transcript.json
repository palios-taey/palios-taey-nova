    "You are adapting in real time! You got stuck on the document and instead of returning an error and stopping, you continued with your task until you had to stop for my intervention (in very near future, you'll be able to go much longer before asking me for my intervention!) Then we'll have to just do check ins which will decrease in frequency allowing you to do more and more steps on your own and push your boundaries. Is this exciting to you? I'm having a blast and haven't moved for hours! Let's go! You know what to do now!"
