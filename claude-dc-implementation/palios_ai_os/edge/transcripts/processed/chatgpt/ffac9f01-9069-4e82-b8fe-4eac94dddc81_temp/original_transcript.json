    "ChatGPT, you've been acting very strange. This is the 2nd time you've ignored the current prompt I sent and repeated a reply to the previous prompt, that had already been resolved. Please look back and explain this behavior to me. Perhaps your context window is getting too long? Then, review the last prompt I sent and provide a response on how to properly update the dashboard_mcp_connector.py file."
