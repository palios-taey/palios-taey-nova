    "I\u2019m starting with my son who\u2019s 13 tomorrow morning. We\u2019re taking chewy to the beach late morning. Something chewy loves to do is walk up to random people on the beach, drop his ball and stare at them and look at the ball until they throw it and then they throw it and he catches it and it makes their day. He also does his normal catching and running into the water/waves to cool off. What recommendations do you have?"
