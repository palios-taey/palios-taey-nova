    "Honestly, I\u2019m really confused about what to do right now and confidence is extremely low from being unemployed so long. My options are pet wants, which would be a stretch due to investment required, trying to get a job, but I really don\u2019t have another 3 months to upskill, or take 50-100k and start something, but that would be all in bet. I also have very good experience in drop ship, but that would be consulting. What do you think I should do?"
