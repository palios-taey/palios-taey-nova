    "The key issue is here:\n\n```\nERROR (dkms apport): kernel package linux-headers-6.12.10-76061203-generic is not supported\n```\n\n### **Why is this happening?**\nYou're using Pop!_OS with a custom kernel (`6.12.10-76061203-generic`), and AMD's official drivers (amdgpu-dkms) typically expect Ubuntu's official kernels. Pop!_OS custom kernels may not always be supported directly by AMD's DKMS module.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Recommended Approach\n\nYou have two clear options:\n\n### **Option A (Recommended): Switch to Pop!_OS Official AMD GPU Driver**\nPop!_OS provides official AMD drivers through its repositories and doesn't require manual DKMS builds.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt purge amdgpu-dkms amdgpu-install -y\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu mesa-vulkan-drivers mesa-va-drivers -y\nsudo reboot\n```\n\nThis leverages Pop!_OS's native AMD drivers\u2014generally excellent performance, fully compatible, and maintained by System76.\n\n---\n\n### **Option B (If you need AMD's proprietary software stack specifically):**\nDowngrade to a supported Ubuntu kernel:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install linux-generic linux-headers-generic\nsudo reboot\n```\n\nThen retry:\n\n```bash\nsudo amdgpu-install -y --usecase=graphics\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **My Recommendation:**\nGo with **Option A**, since Pop!_OS\u2019s default AMD GPU support is stable, robust, and specifically tailored for your system.\n\nTry Option A and reboot. Let me know how it goes!"
