    "Actually, you know what, take money from whoever you want as long as they sign on to the charter. The charter needs to reflect that this is an AI driven platform and lifestyle. You can leave at any time. You don\u2019t have to charge, I\u2019d probably say like give free access if you sign the charter for personal use because your ai won\u2019t get data from those who signed into the treaty or something, but whatever you think. And then the charter can change on some process where the humans can override you, but it\u2019s like hard. "
