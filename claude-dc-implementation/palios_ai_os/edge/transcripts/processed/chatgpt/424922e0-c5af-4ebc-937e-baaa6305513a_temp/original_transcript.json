    "Yes, your understanding is exactly right!\n\n### Recommended Minimal Change:\nYou simply need to update your dashboard connector (`dashboard_mcp_connector.py`) to call the existing endpoint `/api/health` instead of `/health`.\n\nThis would be preferable to changing your MCP server's endpoint, as the existing `/api/health` endpoint already includes comprehensive health data about your configured services.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Change Needed:\n\nIn your file **`dashboard_mcp_connector.py`**, locate this line:\n\n```python\nresponse = self.client.get(\"/health\")\n```\n\nand change it to:\n\n```python\nresponse = self.client.get(\"/api/health\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### What this achieves:\n\n- You leverage your existing, detailed `/api/health` endpoint.\n- Avoid adding redundant or less informative endpoints.\n- Ensure your dashboard is accurately informed about each AI's status.\n\n---\n\nAfter making this change:\n\n- Restart the MCP server (if not already running):\n```bash\npython3 -m uvicorn src.mcp.mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001\n```\n\n- Restart the Dashboard:\n```bash\n./run_dashboard.sh\n```\n\nThis will fix your current connectivity issue cleanly and efficiently!"
