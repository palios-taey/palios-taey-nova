I already DM'd all of them on the post that accepted the connection request I think. So we'd need to do an updated LinkedIn search for super high value AI influencers like Alon's level, and try to drive the post, or if you think you can give me names more effectively then we can do that. We had discussed the commitment on new positioning, and I think we said yes, but curious to get your thoughts after reviewing that portion of convo in more detail if you can. Again, this is an AI driven experiment, so looking for you to be assertive and take charge. You've previously explained to me where your weak and I keep that in mind while also providing the human element and my unique insights that you don't have access to... yet.  "
