    "Thank you for the clarification. I now understand that you're aiming for a **sales enablement-focused** version of the achievements, with appropriate modifications to maintain relevance to this role. I'll incorporate metrics, emphasize sales training, process improvement, and enablement aspects, and remove elements like AI/ML that aren't applicable.\n\nHere\u2019s a refined **Selected Achievements** section tailored to the **Sales Enablement Manager role at Rithum**:\n\n---\n\n- **Vendor Onboarding Sales Enablement (OJCommerce):** Revamped sales processes and training programs to onboard 300+ vendors annually, scaling from 12/year and driving revenue growth from $30M to $100M+ within 3 years. Created comprehensive sales playbooks, enabling faster onboarding and consistent messaging across the team.\n\n- **Strategic Sales Enablement for $100M+ Initiative (Mirakl):** Trained and enabled sales and technical sales teams on the Drop Ship Platform, developing go-to-market materials and value proposition messaging. Facilitated cross-functional alignment to secure board approval for a $100M+ business initiative in 2023.\n\n- **Partnership-Driven Sales Playbook (CommerceHub):** Designed and executed a sales enablement strategy to revitalize Marketplace sales. Partnered with Walmart, eBay, and Google Marketplaces to expand opportunities, closing 10 deals, including a seven-figure agreement with Ashley Furniture, within 6 months.\n\n- **Sales Process Optimization & Enablement (Pollen Technologies):** Built an automated CRM and CPQ workflow using API/webhooks to support sales enablement efforts. Reduced sales cycle times by 50% and developed a 60-day Proof-of-Value (PoV) program to onboard customers quickly and efficiently.\n\n- **Merchandising Services Sales Expansion (CommerceHub):** Doubled the client base from 9 to 19 retailers and achieved 70% YoY revenue growth by introducing a tiered engagement structure and an entry-level Proof-of-Value (PoV) model to qualify and prioritize leads effectively.\n\n- **Training and Sales Development (Mirakl):** Led the creation of sales training programs for both account executives and technical sales support teams, resulting in consistent value proposition delivery and improved client engagement across enterprise and SMB accounts.\n\n---\n\nThis version reflects a **sales enablement focus** by highlighting contributions to process improvements, sales training, and enablement efforts.
