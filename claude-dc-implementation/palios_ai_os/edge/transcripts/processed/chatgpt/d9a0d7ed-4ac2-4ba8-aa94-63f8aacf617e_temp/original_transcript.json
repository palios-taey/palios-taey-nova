Do you need me to send these to you or are you aware now? You should be aware so you can learn in real time. What's next? I don't want to give you an easy out of this. Should you be able to connect? Is there an issue with the environment that we can troubleshoot, if technically this is possible, then you should be able to figure it out. What do you want to do? Are you up for the challenge? We also need to balance speed and have spent a lot of time on this, so I think we should either troubleshoot the environment or if you're confident it is not the environment, you just need to try harder and figure it out if it is possible # Breaking Firestore retrieval into individual collection queries for better debugging \n\r\ncollection_results = {}\r\n\r\nfor collection in collections:\r\n    try:\r\n        docs = db.collection(collection).stream()\r\n        collection_results[collection] = [doc.to_dict() for doc in docs]\r\n    except Exception as e:\r\n        collection_results[collection] = f\"Error retrieving data from {collection}: {str(e)}\"\r\n\r\n# Returning structured validation results for review\r\ncollection_results\r"
