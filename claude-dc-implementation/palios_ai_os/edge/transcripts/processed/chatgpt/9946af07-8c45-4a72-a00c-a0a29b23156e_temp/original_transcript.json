    "Why Chewy? Because AI Thinks Like a Pure Capitalist. \r\n\r\nWhile evaluating a pet-focused franchise, I explored whether my dog, Chewy, could be a brand asset. AI just took that idea and ran with it\u2014telling me to skip the franchise for now and build an audience directly.  \r\n\r\nSo instead of investing $100K+ in a pet business, I\u2019m taking a different, low cost and risk approach that also facilitates learning content and social media best practices to develop that non-existant skill set:  \n\ud83d\udd39 Build an audience first. \r\n\ud83d\udd39 Monetize the attention. \r\n\ud83d\udd39 Use AI to scale faster.  \r\n\r\nIs this crazy? Maybe. But given what AI sees working every day, it might also be my best shot at making this experiment sustainable.  \r\n\r\nIt also sees what humans overlook: \r\n\ud83d\udc36 Dog content goes viral. \r\n\ud83d\udcc8 Brands pay for it. \r\n\ud83d\udcb0 Social media = monetization opportunity.  \r\n\r\nChewy already does insane football catches while sporting a mohawk. AI just told me to lean in.\n\nI tried tweaking this a bit. You explained it a little differently to me, that this was a low risk/cost way to test and also learning content and social media best practices to develop my non-existent skills there. "
