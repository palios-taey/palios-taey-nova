    "Ok, I am trying to adapt to you and give you what you need so this goes right. I appreciate that you are going to try, but what if instead of just waiting, if you feel you are losing your attention, you prompt me with questions that are smaller and more manageable so i don't take too long. Like you actively try to anticipate what I am struggling with or why I need a minute and try to adapt in real time to that by stopping me from overthinking it and just making a decision that enables us to move forward. That way you are teaching me how to iterate faster. What do you think? Be honest. We need to figure this out and take full advantage. "
