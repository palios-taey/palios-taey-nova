    "**Next up: Alex Hase (GM & CRO, Americas at Mirakl)**  \n\nSince you have **Mirakl history** and **previously messaged him**, this one should acknowledge that past connection while keeping it **concise and direct**.  \n\n---\n\n**Hey Alex,**  \n\nHope you\u2019re doing well! It\u2019s been a while since we last connected, but I wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market faster than anyone is prepared for, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.  \n\nSo I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment\u2014leveraging AI to guide my next move, automate the job search, and rethink work itself.  \n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help. A **reshare would be huge**, but even just a **like or comment** could help get it in front of the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!  \n\nAppreciate it, Alex.  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\nThis keeps it **personal** but **efficient** since you already have a professional connection. Let me know if this works or if you want any tweaks!"
