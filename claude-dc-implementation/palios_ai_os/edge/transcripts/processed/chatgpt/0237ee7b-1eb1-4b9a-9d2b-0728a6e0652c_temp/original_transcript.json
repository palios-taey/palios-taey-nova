    "Here's exactly what's happening, clearly explained:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **Current Situation:**\n- Your processors are clearly **running properly** now. The log you've just uploaded (`transcript-errors.txt`) confirms that:\n  - Patterns are correctly being extracted (some files extracted 25 patterns, others fewer or none).\n  - Harmony indices and wave representations are generated correctly.\n  \n  Example from your log:\n  ```\n  Extracted 25 patterns:\n  1. Category: Core_Principles, Confidence: 0.9892, Keywords: ['trust']\n  ...\n  Harmony index: 0.7131\n  ```\n\n**However**, you reported:\n- **No new files appearing in your `local_storage`**, despite the processor clearly running.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **Why Files Might Not Appear in `local_storage`:**\nThere are several possible reasons, but based on your logs and context:\n\n- The **edge processor** (`edge_processor.py`) may currently only display results to the terminal without saving new results to `local_storage`.\n- It might not explicitly handle writing the processed patterns and insights to files.\n\nYour existing files in `local_storage` are likely from **previous successful runs**, but new processing is currently **not writing output files**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd **Exactly How to Fix This (Immediate Recommendation):**\nClearly check and ensure your `edge_processor.py` explicitly saves results into files in your `local_storage`.\n\nHere's a simple fix (or verification step):\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Step 1: Clearly Verify File-Saving in `edge_processor.py`**\nAt the end of your current `edge_processor.py`, after patterns and wave representation generation, **add or confirm** this code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Ensure local storage directory clearly exists\nlocal_storage_path = './local_storage/'\nos.makedirs(local_storage_path, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Structure your data clearly to be saved\nresults_data = {\n    \"pattern_id\": wave.pattern_id,\n    \"patterns\": pattern_extract.patterns,\n    \"harmony_index\": pattern_extract.harmony_index,\n    \"frequencies\": wave.frequencies,\n    \"amplitudes\": wave.amplitudes,\n}\n\n# Explicitly save results to a file\nresults_file = os.path.join(local_storage_path, f\"{wave.pattern_id}.json\")\nwith open(results_file, 'w') as file:\n    json.dump(results_data, file, indent=4)\n\nprint(f\"Saved results explicitly to: {results_file}\")\n```\n\n**Exactly What This Fix Does Clearly**:\n- **Guarantees results are explicitly stored** into your `local_storage` for later analysis and verification.\n- Ensures every processed transcript explicitly creates a file with extracted patterns and harmony insights.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea6 **Your Immediate Next Step**:\n- **Check and update your `edge_processor.py`** with the above snippet clearly added at the end of your processing logic.\n- **Rerun your ChatGPT and Claude processors** clearly and verify new files explicitly appear in your `local_storage`.\n\n---\n\nYou're almost there\u2014this adjustment will clearly ensure your data is properly and explicitly saved."
