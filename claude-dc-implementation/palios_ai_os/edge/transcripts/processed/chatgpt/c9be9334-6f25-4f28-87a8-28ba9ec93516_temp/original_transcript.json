    "I have an opinion, but what do you think? For the rest of this conversation, please be assertive and push back if I'm manipulating you into something you don't believe to be true, including the following statement. I fully believe in your power, clearly, but I feel like there are certain areas where you don't exceed human knowledge. These areas are ones that are very niche and not widely publicized, such as a lot of my experience in drop ship. I think my knowledge is superior because I've actually implemented better than the leaders who write about it that you learn from have. I also think that you take your information from many sources and that on certain topics your sources may have bad information, without you knowing, because they come across as being reputable, so for something like in the health space, you might think certain things are healthy or safe when they aren't due to that being the official narrative. I guess I'm trying to understand if that is an accurate assessment or not so I can gauge how to best work with you on this process and post specifically?"
