    "For ESE Solutions, here's how I would prioritize and select relevant **skills** for LinkedIn that best align with your role, the achievements, and the goals we've discussed. I'll also reorder and refine the list to ensure it's aligned with your narrative and potential recruiter searches:\n\n### Recommended Top 10 Skills for ESE Solutions:\n1. **Strategic Partnerships**  \n2. **E-Commerce**  \n3. **Cross-Functional Team Leadership**  \n4. **Business Process Improvement**  \n5. **New Business Development**  \n6. **Contract Negotiation**  \n7. **Program Management**  \n8. **Pricing Strategy**  \n9. **Business Case Development**  \n10. **Revenue & Profit Growth**  \n\n---\n\n### Refinement for Alignment:\n- **Keep focus on actionable leadership skills** like **Strategic Partnerships** and **Business Development**, which demonstrate your ability to drive growth and collaboration.  \n- **E-Commerce** and **E-Commerce Optimization** are critical as they directly tie to your experiences and roles.  \n- **Revenue & Profit Growth** aligns with metrics-driven outcomes highlighted in your achievements.  \n- **Contract Negotiation** is directly applicable to the partnership-building narrative in ESE and CommerceHub.  \n- Avoid overly generic skills like **Interpersonal Skills**, **Problem Solving**, or **Communication**, as they dilute the focus.  \n\nWould you like to finalize this for ESE Solutions, or adjust based on other priorities?"
