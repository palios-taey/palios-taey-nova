    "### **\ud83d\udd39 Next Steps Based on Objectives**\nI completely agree with your prioritization. Here's the **updated plan of action**:\n\n## **1\ufe0f\u20e3 X First Post - Setting the Tone**\n- **Format:** A thread. X favors engagement-heavy posts (likes/comments/quote tweets), and a thread makes it easier for people to engage without scrolling past one giant wall of text.\n- **Content:**  \n   - **Base it on LinkedIn post** but with **added depth for X\u2019s audience.**  \n   - Reincorporate **Singularity discussion, AI taking over white-collar work, and CTOs ditching junior/mid-level coders.**  \n   - Frame the post to **spark debate.** LinkedIn is about engagement. X thrives on controversy, contrarian takes, and predictions.  \n\n- **Structure:**  \n   1. **Hook:** \"I've been unemployed for 2 years. So I asked AI what to do next. Its answer changed everything.\"  \n   2. **AI job market shifts:** How white-collar jobs are disappearing, Y Combinator's investment focus.  \n   3. **Exponential AI growth & Singularity:** The \u2018floppy disk\u2019 analogy, why 2 years from now is going to be a **seismic** leap.  \n   4. **AI\u2019s response to me:** What it told me to do & why.  \n   5. **The Experiment:** Following AI's advice **blindly.**  \n   6. **How people can help.**  \n   7. **End with a question that encourages replies & debate.**  \n\n- **Media:**  \n   - Attach **Chewy\u2019s beach football video** (fun element, breaks up text).  \n   - Possibly a screenshot of **Y Combinator\u2019s AI 2025 investment focus** for credibility.  \n\n---\n\n## **2\ufe0f\u20e3 LinkedIn Pre-Launch Strategy**\nSince **LinkedIn\u2019s outreach is limited**, here\u2019s the strategic **Monday plan**:\n\n### **\u27a1\ufe0f DM Limits & Outreach Strategy**\n- **Max daily connection requests:** 100-200 (safe range to avoid LinkedIn jail).  \n- **Max daily DMs (for 1st-degree connections):** ~50-100 before LinkedIn limits kick in.  \n- **Solution:**  \n   - **Prioritize most influential & engaged connections first.**  \n   - Use **text/email for high-value contacts** who may boost visibility.  \n   - Send **group messages for efficiency.**  \n\n### **\u27a1\ufe0f Pre-Launch Execution Plan**\n1. **Personalized DMs (Monday morning)**  \n   - Fraternity brothers, Purdue Alumni, past LinkedIn conversations.  \n   - Daniela Bin (to get in front of Keith Krach\u2019s network).  \n   - Well-connected SaaS friends.  \n   \n2. **Group Message Strategy**  \n   - Separate **high-impact contacts (DM individually)** from **broader groups (group DM).**  \n   - Leverage **LinkedIn Groups** (post pre-announcement in relevant AI/SaaS groups).  \n\n3. **Alternative Channels**  \n   - **Text/email** for key people (easier than waiting on LinkedIn\u2019s limits).  \n\n---\n\n## **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Growth Strategy for Other Socials**\nSince you want to look **credible across platforms** for cross-followers:\n- **X Growth:**  \n   - Automated **follow/unfollow method** for AI/automation niche.  \n   - Engagement strategy (commenting on major AI/X influencer threads).  \n   - **Automate thank-you DMs** when people follow.  \n\n- **Instagram/TikTok:**  \n   - Maintain **daily Chewy posts** (easy repurposing).  \n   - Experiment with **engagement hacking** (commenting on viral dog accounts).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Priorities for Today**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Finalize **X first post** (draft thread & structure).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Prepare **LinkedIn pre-launch outreach strategy.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Set up **automation options for LinkedIn/X responses.**  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Thoughts? Do we tweak the X post strategy before drafting?**"
