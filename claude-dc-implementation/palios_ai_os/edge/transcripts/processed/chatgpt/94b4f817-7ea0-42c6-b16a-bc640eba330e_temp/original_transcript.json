    "The next step is to verify that your Gemini Pro API integration works correctly by testing the new endpoint. Here's what you need to do and deliver back:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Testing the Gemini Integration Endpoint**\n\n1. **Run Your Local Server:**\n   - Make sure your local development environment is set up to run **main.py**.\n   - Start your server by running:\n     ```cmd\n     python main.py\n     ```\n   - Confirm that the server starts without errors and logs indicate that the Gemini Pro API client has been initialized.\n\n2. **Test the execute_gemini Endpoint:**\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n   - Execute the following curl command (or use Postman) to send a test request:\n     ```cmd\n     curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Test Gemini integration\\\"}\" http://localhost:8080/execute_gemini\n     ```\n   - The expected output should be a JSON response that includes:\n     - The original prompt.\n     - A field named `\"gemini_response\"` containing the API's response.\n     - A `\"status\"` field showing success.\n\n3. **Deliverable to Provide Back:**\n   - Capture the complete output (the JSON response) from the curl command.\n   - Also, capture the relevant server logs showing that the request was processed by the `execute_gemini` function (including any logging messages from GeminiProAPI).\n   - Combine these into a brief report or a text file that summarizes:\n     - The test command you used.\n     - The JSON output received.\n     - Any key log messages that indicate the integration call was successful.\n   \n   This report will serve as your deliverable, confirming that the integration is set up and functioning as expected.\n\n---\n\nPlease proceed with these steps and share the test report (with the JSON output and log excerpts) as your deliverable. Let me know if you run into any issues or need further clarification."
