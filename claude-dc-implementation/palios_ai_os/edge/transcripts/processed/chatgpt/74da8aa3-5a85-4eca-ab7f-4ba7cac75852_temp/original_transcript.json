    "Hey Keith,\n\nNot sure if you remember, but back in when I was in college like 20 years ago, I cold-emailed you after reading an article in Inc. and told you that you should write a book because my Sigma Chi brothers and I were running around setting up lunches with adminstrators and alumni. We ended up chatting a couple of times, and and met at a Sigma Chi event.\n\nFigured I\u2019d reach out again\u2014because I\u2019m about to take another big (and uncomfortable) swing.\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market faster than anyone is prepared for, and I\u2019ve realized I need to stop playing by the old rules.\n\nSo I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment\u2014leveraging AI to guide my next move, automate the job search, and rethink work itself.\n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help. A reshare would be incredible, but even just a like or comment could make a big difference in reaching the right people.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!\n\nThanks so much, Keith. Appreciate it.\n\n\u2014 Jesse\n\nNot sure if this adds value or not"
