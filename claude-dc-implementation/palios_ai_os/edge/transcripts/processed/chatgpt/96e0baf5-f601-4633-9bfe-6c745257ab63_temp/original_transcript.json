    "ChatGPT, Claude DC is doing something in one of the scripts that is creating a credentials folder in the claude-dc-implementation directory and is placing the service key json in it. Did you see that anywhere? Or need me to send you a file? This needs to be updated and work from pulling it from the secrets folder. If the service json needs to be stored separately, I can do that in the secrets folder. I just tried pushing to github and got an error. "
