    "Let's remove Creator from the notion canvas to document in real time. I've deleted it from the table. We need to get the rest of the info in the tables before I can link them, so I'll go back through and do that when we're done entering the data. Get the canvas updated and we can go back to the PKD to do that one the right way following the process. We won't need to redo sample data, just review the properties in the new format and get that into canvas"
