    "The error **\"did not match any files\"** means that the large files were already removed from Git tracking (which is good!). However, Git LFS is still trying to upload them.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Final Steps to Fix This**\nSince Git LFS is **still trying to push these files**, we need to **completely reset Git LFS tracking**.\n\n#### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Stop the Upload**\nIf Git is still trying to upload, press:\n```bash\nCtrl + C\n```\n\n#### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Untrack All Git LFS Files**\nRun:\n```bash\ngit lfs untrack \"*.exe\"\n```\nThis tells Git LFS to stop tracking all `.exe` files.\n\nThen, commit this change:\n```bash\ngit add .gitattributes\ngit commit -m \"Untracked all large files from Git LFS\"\n```\n\n#### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Clear Git LFS Cache**\nRemove all **locally stored** large files that Git LFS was tracking:\n```bash\nrm -rf .git/lfs\ngit lfs prune\n```\n\n#### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Force Push to Reset Remote Repository**\nNow, **overwrite any previous push attempts** and ensure that your repository is clean:\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main --force\n```\n\n---\n\n### **\u2705 Expected Outcome**\n- **Terraform `.exe` files are completely removed from Git and Git LFS.**\n- **GitHub will no longer block your push.**\n- **Future pushes will work smoothly.**\n\nOnce you've done this, your Git setup should be completely fixed. Let me know if you hit any more issues! \ud83d\ude80"
