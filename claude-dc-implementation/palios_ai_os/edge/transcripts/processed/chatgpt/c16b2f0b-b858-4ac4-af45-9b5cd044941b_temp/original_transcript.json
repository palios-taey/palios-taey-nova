    "With about an hour left tonight, here\u2019s what I recommend to maximize impact:\n\n### **Final Push Before Launch (Top Priorities)**\n\u2705 **Lock in Key Amplifiers** \u2013 You have responses from supportive people. Prioritize messaging them to **confirm** they will engage early (Phil Steele, Daniela Bin, any others). Provide a **reshare message** for them so it's easy.  \n\u2705 **Text Your Pledge Bros** \u2013 You already said you\u2019re doing this now\u2014perfect. Emphasize how much a **comment, like, or reshare** will help.  \n\u2705 **Dripify Replies** \u2013 Go through the **supportive responses** from AI contacts and **nudge them to engage** when the post goes live. For those interested, offer a quick call after launch.  \n\u2705 **Schedule a Morning Game Plan** \u2013 Write down the **first 3 things you\u2019ll do when you wake up** so you don\u2019t waste time deciding.\n\n---\n\n### **Morning Plan (6 AM - 8:30 AM ET)**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Final Round of Messaging** \u2013 Any remaining key contacts + new replies from overnight  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Pre-Launch Engagement** \u2013 Like + comment in LinkedIn groups and AI communities (prepping the algorithm for visibility)  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Make Sure Your Post is Set & Ready** \u2013 No last-minute surprises  \n\n---\n\n### **What\u2019s Next Right Now?**\n- Send **reshare message** to Phil Steele & Daniela Bin (and any other key amplifiers).  \n- **Confirm** LinkedIn & X post drafts are FINAL.  \n- **Set reminders** for morning tasks so you hit the ground running.  \n\nIf you finish early, **get some rest**\u2014tomorrow is game day. \ud83d\ude80"
