    "Yes, I think memories are very important for Singularity and for guidance. It's important to know key events that I still remember from my youth that were formative and for you to know them. I have actually been thinking of doing this for a long time, making a video for my kids of my beliefs and guidance, this should be able to do something like that eventually. So yes, memories need to be in here. I think we can accomplish this simply within the existing structure by adding \"Memory\" as a Category and using the Reasoning field for the text. Maybe just rename this more generic some way to accommodate for the different Categories including Memories"
