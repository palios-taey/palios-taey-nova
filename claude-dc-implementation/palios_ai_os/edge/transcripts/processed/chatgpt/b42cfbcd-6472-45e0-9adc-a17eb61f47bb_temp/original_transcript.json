    "We haven't been evaluating them wrong for decades, we're just doing it wrong now because of the advances in AI. Experience, skills and education are no longer sufficient. the most important thing in a candidate is how can they use AI to become a force multiplier.\n\nInstead of just talking about it, we're testing it.\nWe\u2019re taking a real job and using AI to match a candidate based on their ability to implement AI within that role.\nIf you\u2019re a hiring manager, recruiter, or job seeker, submit a job description\u2014we\u2019ll show how this works.\nIf we don\u2019t get submissions, we\u2019ll pick one ourselves.\nThe full automation will be built by Monday.\n\nThis was not the test, but close. I'm going to building something to apply to jobs in this manner and conduct corresponding outreach. The ask is if there are hiring managers who have jobs in a few bullets that reflect my areas of expertise, then drop them in the comments and we'll use. Or if you're in a similar role, drop your current job description in there. "
