    "I think there is a bit of misunderstanding on my background due to this chat having to transition from a previous one of resume building. I haven't really done sales enablement in a full time or close to full time capacity, same with partnerships. Both have been parts of roles, but are a bit of a stretch for me. If you review all the resumes provided and our conversations that are not around resumes for specific listings, does your perspective change or still the same? If still the same, that's fine, but I wanted to call that out."
