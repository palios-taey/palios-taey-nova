    "**Verifying role issues**  \n\nThe user encountered an error when trying to add the role \"roles/generativeLanguage.user.\" The error indicates that this role isn't supported for the resource. I need to verify that the correct role exists in the system. One possibility is that \"Generative Language API User\" might be a preview role or different role, such as \"roles/generativeLanguage.agent\" or \"roles/generativeLanguage.developer.\" It could also be related to \"Cloud Machine Learning Engine\" roles. I might need to check documentation to confirm the appropriate role.\n\n**Clarifying service account role**\n\nHmm, after thinking it through, it seems that the service account might not need the \"roles/generativeLanguage.user\" role specifically, since the API call is made with the service account credentials. The error suggests that the role isn't assignable to service accounts, so I\u2019m wondering if the role should instead be assigned at the project level. According to the GCP docs, the service account might just need the \"Service Account Token Creator\" role, and the API might work without the generative language role."
