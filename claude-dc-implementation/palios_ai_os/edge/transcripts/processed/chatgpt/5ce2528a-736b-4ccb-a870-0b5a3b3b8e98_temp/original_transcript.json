    "Here\u2019s a draft email you could send to the hiring manager for the **Director, Commerce Revenue** role at Logicbroker:\n\n---\n\n**Subject: Reconnecting for Director, Commerce Revenue Role**\n\nHi [Hiring Manager\u2019s Name],\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I noticed that Logicbroker is currently hiring for the Director, Commerce Revenue position, and I wanted to reach out to express my interest. As you may remember, I was previously offered this position, but opted to join Mirakl at the time. \n\nReflecting on my experience since then, including leading transformative initiatives at Mirakl and CommerceHub, I\u2019m confident that my expertise in scaling digital marketplaces, managing enterprise-level sales processes, and delivering revenue growth aligns well with Logicbroker\u2019s goals. The opportunity to help drive new business, especially with your impressive client roster and the latest investment from K1, is incredibly exciting to me.\n\nI would love the opportunity to reconnect and discuss how I can contribute to Logicbroker\u2019s continued success in this role. Let me know if you have any time this week for a brief conversation.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Info]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to tweak this based on your style!"
