    "My wife liked Pet Wants the best, I'm going to have to get a job I think, so won't be able to do this full time but she will. She didn't like Kidokentics, but if I can't get a job, then that or TeamLogic would probably be my choices. What do you think reasonable income is for Pet Wants if I get the Boca Raton territory, which is highly affluent with lots of dog owners at 6/12/18 months?"
