    "**Nope!** The SSH key doesn't go into your repository directory.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Clearly Explained (Exactly Where the Key Should Go):**\n\nSSH keys should always live in your home directory's hidden `.ssh` folder, exactly here:\n\n```bash\n/home/jesse/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\n- **Never** put your SSH key directly into your git repository directory.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Exactly What You Should Do Right Now (Clearly stated again):**\n\nRun this exact command from anywhere in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\nThis command ensures your SSH key is placed exactly here:\n\n```\n/home/jesse/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\nThen paste your private key clearly into this file, save, and set permissions clearly:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea9 **Important:**  \n- **Do not put the key in your project folder** (like `/home/jesse/projects/palios-taey-nova/`). It must stay securely in `~/.ssh`.\n\nOnce done, test again clearly:\n\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\nThen you\u2019ll be perfectly set."
