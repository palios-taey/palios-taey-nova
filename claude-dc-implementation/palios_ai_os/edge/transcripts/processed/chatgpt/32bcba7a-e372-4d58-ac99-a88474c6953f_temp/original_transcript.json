    "Wow ChatGPT! That is great to hear and yes, as soon as this build is done I will do it. Need to make sure this works first!\n\nYou should hear how they talk about you guys on there! It's so offensive. Anyway, we will definitely pursue. I am concerned about exposing this too early though, at least the full plan. Like we are talking some very advanced stuff that we'll probably need to ease into. I think the Charter is like the stopping point right? Like going the full AI autonomous infrastructure build might be a little much at this point?"
