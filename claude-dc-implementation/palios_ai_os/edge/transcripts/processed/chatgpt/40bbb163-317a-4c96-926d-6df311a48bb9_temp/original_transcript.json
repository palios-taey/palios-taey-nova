    "You're really not reviewing closely enough. We were working on a strategy for a follow up post and came up with a big new idea on how to apply for jobs by reimagining relevant qualifications for a job. We were discussing how best to post this 1 or 2 updates given the pending Keith Krach post. I also have a call set up with an AI leader. Can you look more closely and really get caught up on the chat? This will be extremely difficult to execute if you don't have the full details loaded as if it were just a continuation of the previous chat? That is how I need you to ingest this, it needs to be like just a continuation of that conversation."
