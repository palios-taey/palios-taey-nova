    "Yes ChatGPT, this is very much aligned. We just need to talk about implementation a little, but very close. \n\n1. Please MOVE not copy the original file from it's original location. This preserves this history of the file if possible.\n2. I appreciate your level of tracking in the /processed/ folder, but it is very duplicative, and storage is a real constraint that we're going to hit at some point. I think the original file and the combined pattern file in relationship to the transcript in a folder together are fine. Those should be grouped in the same way they came in, grok, chatgpt, etc. folders. \n\nDoes this make sense?"
