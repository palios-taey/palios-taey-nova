    "I keep telling my son I think we\u2019re sweet and should post our workouts with chewy. We go to the beach every day he\u2019s with me and do wide receiver and corner drills, like routes hip turns and box drills while I\u2019m also throwing ball for chewy and he\u2019s guarding Reagan or Reagan\u2019s guarding him. And I\u2019ll throw a bomb to Reagan and then throw a bomb to chewy. Everyone who walks by us especially dads look at me like they think I\u2019m so sweet. And well do moving push up in insanity listening to his hardcore rap music. Is that X lifestyle content. \n\nI\u2019m out at bar so can\u2019t do actual work and running ideas by you. "
