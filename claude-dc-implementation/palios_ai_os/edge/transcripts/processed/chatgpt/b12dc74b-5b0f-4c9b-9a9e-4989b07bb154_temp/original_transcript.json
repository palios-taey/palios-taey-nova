    "That\u2019s a strong response. Just a few tweaks for flow, clarity, and impact:\n\n---\n\n**Great question, Jonathan Waggoner.** The biggest risk large corporations face isn\u2019t just underestimating AI\u2014it\u2019s **internal resistance to change.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Managers protecting headcount & inefficient processes** \u2013 AI threatens entrenched structures, and many leaders hesitate to disrupt their own teams. But delaying AI adoption opens the door for **smaller, more agile competitors** to outmaneuver them.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Legacy systems & workforce training** \u2013 AI implementation isn\u2019t plug-and-play for most enterprises. Companies that invest in upskilling employees and integrating AI into existing workflows will gain the edge. Those that don\u2019t will struggle to keep up with AI-native startups.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Misjudging the speed of change** \u2013 We\u2019ve seen this before (Blockbuster, Kodak, Borders), but the difference now? **AI isn\u2019t just another disruptive technology\u2014it\u2019s accelerating every other disruption at the same time.** The cost of building something like Netflix back then was massive\u2014now, with open-source AI tools, similar innovations are nearly free.  \n\nBig corporations have the resources to adapt\u2014but the real question is, **will they move fast enough?**  \n\n---\n\nThis version keeps it concise but impactful while reinforcing the idea that AI is different from past disruptions. Let me know if you want any other refinements!"
