    "**wideretrieverchewy** is a solid option! It keeps the **brand identity** of \"Wide Retriever\" while adding **Chewy\u2019s name**, making it more personal and unique. If it\u2019s available across platforms, I\u2019d say go for it.  \n\nA couple of things to consider:  \n- It makes it **clear** that Chewy is the face of the brand.  \n- It might be **longer** than ideal for some platforms, but if consistency across all accounts is the goal, it's a strong pick.  \n- If you ever expand beyond Chewy (e.g., additional dogs, merch, etc.), it might feel limiting.  \n\nIf you want to test shorter versions:  \n- **wideretrieverco**  \n- **wideretrieverhq**  \n- **wideretrieverdog**  \n- **wideretriever.chewy** (if dots are allowed)  \n\nWant me to check for availability before locking it in?"
