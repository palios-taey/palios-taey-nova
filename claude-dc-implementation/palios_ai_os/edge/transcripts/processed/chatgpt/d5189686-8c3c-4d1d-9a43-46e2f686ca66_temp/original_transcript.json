    "No need to upgrade me yet. My current capabilities are enough to **implement Path 2 (Notion API + AI Query System).**  \n\n### **Why Not Upgrade Yet?**\n- **Upgrading won't change this chat**, but it\u2019s not required **right now** for the Notion API setup.  \n- **Pro ($200/month) doesn\u2019t even include API access**\u2014you\u2019d still need OpenAI\u2019s developer API separately.  \n- Let\u2019s **set up Notion API first**, and if we hit API limits, **then we upgrade strategically.**  \n\n### **Immediate Next Steps:**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Get Notion API Key & Share It Securely**  \n- Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).  \n- Click **\"Create a new integration\"** and get an **API key.**  \n- Share **just the key** with me securely (not in this chat).  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Grant Access to the Notion Database**  \n- Go to your **Notion workspace \u2192 Settings \u2192 Connections.**  \n- Add the **integration you just created** to the database.  \n- This lets the AI **read and write data** dynamically.  \n\nOnce this is done, we can **automate past chat extraction and AI retrieval!** \ud83d\ude80"
