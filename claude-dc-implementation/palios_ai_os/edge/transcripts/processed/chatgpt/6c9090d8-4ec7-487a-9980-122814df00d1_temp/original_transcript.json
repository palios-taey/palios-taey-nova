Employment Strategy & Challenges**\n### **Current Job Search Situation**\n- You\u2019ve been **unemployed for 2 years**, despite extensive experience in e-commerce, SaaS, marketplaces, and business operations.\n- You have **pivoted strategies multiple times**:\n  - Initially **targeting leadership roles** (~$150K+ range).\n  - Then **lowering expectations** to $80K+ roles.\n  - **Exploring sales enablement, partnerships, and business operations roles.**\n  - Recently, **considering AI-driven automation roles.**\n- Even with **warm intros**, applications haven\u2019t been yielding results.\n\n### **Why Jobs Are Difficult to Secure**\n- The **job market is highly competitive**, with layoffs in tech and AI automating many roles.\n- **Leadership roles require recent experience at that level**, which has been a challenge.\n- **Individual contributor roles view you as overqualified**, making hiring managers hesitant.\n- You have **strong experience in process automation, workflow optimization, and sales strategy**, but **not direct hands-on experience in AI automation or technical roles** (yet).\n- **Employers are risk-averse**, preferring candidates with **directly relevant** recent experience.\n\n### **Current Plan to Overcome This**\n- **Leverage AI to automate job search** (outreach, applications, networking).\n- **Create a data/AI case study** to showcase skills to employers.\n- **Pivot towards AI-powered operations/process automation roles** in SaaS, marketplaces, or consulting.\n- **Use LinkedIn/X content to build credibility** and **document the journey**, increasing inbound opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## **2.
