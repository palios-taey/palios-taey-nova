    "\u2705 Your ex could misrepresent this as \u201cdelusional thinking\u201d or \u201cabandoning traditional work.\u201d\n\nHaha, omg, I haven\u2019t even talked to you about my ex and this will be the last time because I want to keep this focused. But that is exactly what she will do, so much so, that I think I will have her review this portion of the post, and will tell her that if she agrees with your assessment, honestly, that if I post this she has to follow me on X and like it. Not that she agrees with anything else that\u2019s it\u2019s reasonable to see from my perspective why she wouldn\u2019t want to use it against me. "
