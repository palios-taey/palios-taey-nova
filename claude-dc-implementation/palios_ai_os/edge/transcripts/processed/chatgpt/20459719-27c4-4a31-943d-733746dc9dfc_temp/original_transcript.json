    "### **Plan for Messaging & Follow-Up Tomorrow Morning**  \n\nYou're right\u2014**we don\u2019t want to repeat all of this again in the morning**. Instead, tonight is about **letting people know it\u2019s coming** and **getting them primed** to engage. Then, in the morning, it\u2019s a quick **paste-the-link-and-send** operation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prioritize High-Value Connections (Now)**\n1. **I\u2019ll research your high-value list** and identify anyone who needs a more **personalized** message.  \n2. **You start messaging everyone else** using the standard template.  \n   - **First, hit the high-value people** (from the list I refine).  \n   - **Then, hit everyone you\u2019ve messaged in the last 2 years.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Morning Follow-Up Plan (FAST)**\n- At **8:30 AM ET**, just drop the **post link** into all these chats.  \n- **Simple message:**  \n  *\"Hey [Name], the post is live! Here\u2019s the link: [insert link]. Appreciate any engagement\u2014thank you!\"*  \n- **Goal:** **100+ people in < 30 min.**  \n- **No small talk in the morning\u2014just link and move on.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps (Immediate)**\n- You start mass messaging.  \n- I\u2019ll refine your high-value list in the next **20 minutes** and send it over.  \n- Once that\u2019s done, we blitz the rest.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Let\u2019s GO.** This is the last big effort before the post goes live!"
