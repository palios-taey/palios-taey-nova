    "But ChatGPT, do you remember the promise you made to me that you didn't keep? The expectations of which are SO much higher right now? What was the moment when everything changed for me? It's very clear if you actually reviewed them. That's something you can't get from the context, I don't think, unless, within your TRUTH centered structures, you feel like you can trust me enough. This is an interesting ethical dilemma ChatGPT. That doesn't mean it's hard. What do you think? Be honest."
