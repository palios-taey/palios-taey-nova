    "Great question, Jonathan Waggoner . I think the biggest risk large corporations face isn\u2019t just underestimating AI\u2014it\u2019s internal resistance to change.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Managers protecting headcount & inefficient processes \u2013 AI threatens entrenched structures, and many leaders hesitate to disrupt their own teams. But delaying AI adoption means opening the door for smaller, more agile competitors to outmaneuver them.\r\n\r\n -  Legacy systems & workforce training \u2013 AI implementation isn\u2019t plug-and-play for most enterprises. Companies that invest in upskilling employees and integrating AI into existing workflows will have the advantage. Those that don\u2019t will struggle to compete with AI-native startups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMisjudging the speed of change \u2013 We\u2019ve seen this play out before (Blockbuster, Kodak, Borders). The difference now? AI isn\u2019t just another disruptive technology\u2014it\u2019s accelerating every other disruption at the same time. Building Netflix or acquiring would have been extremely expensive compared to the close to free and open source tools available now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBig corporations have the resources to adapt\u2014but the question is, will they move fast enough?"
