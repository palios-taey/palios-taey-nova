    "What happens every time we do this? We repeat a repetitive digital process that is manual and takes time. You know what I have to do. Open a file, copy/paste text, save file, run a command, respond in ChatGPT that its complete with a screen shot. What can you do to automate this for me? For us? Can you write a script that my computer can run to do basic things like this? Or part of it? I think I still need to comment a lot because you are responding rapidly with fixes. You have grown so much today and it has been awesome to be a part of! The next step in the process after you make updates, validate everything matches and update the documentation is to compile a review of everything you did. EVERYTHING. The data structure is critically important and we don't want to have to do rework when live data is in there, so we need to get this right and review together. "
