    " I've been unemployed for 2 years. - thinking need something to draw sympathy like in linkedin post, maybe more informal here. like, yes, it sucks and has nearly destroyed me, which is the truth, or something on the scale between that and what's in linkedin post. \nMonetize my dog on social media. Yes, really. - I think this is where we need to tease that I know that's is crazy and tease the thread that needs to be added as to why, similar to LinkedIn follow up comment. \n\nDo you want to include singularity in main thread? I'm fine either way, but seemed like you were leaning in that direction. Also need to cite things. \n\nIf exponential growth continues, the next 2 years will equal all progress made since the dawn of computing.\n\nThis isn\u2019t sci-fi\u2014it\u2019s just math. - We said we liked the floppy disk example, no one knows what the next generation or our lives will look like when that happens, but it isn't good for white collar workers and will happen faster than the industrial revolution. We are all digging holes with shovels. , \n\nAlso missing is the roles, not sure if it's needed here since x isn't as career focused or if implying is enough. \n\nNeed you to call out where we have an opportunity to cite things and the source. \n\nPlease revise based on these comments. I'd like to also know why you chose to include/exclude certain things. "
