    "Ok, there are probably a few different buckets here. \n1. Outreach to friends/family (mainly my pledge brothers from fraternity via text.) This doesn't have to have much effort because they'll do it. \n2. Custom outreach to high value influencers in network. Like I've talked to Rick Watson a few times. Harry Joiner is very active/well connected recruiter who I've spoken to a bunch and he placed me once. How can we identify these people that will help with virality and craft relevant messages to them? Is there a way for us to connect to my LinkedIn for something to scan my connections and assess virality? Or is there an efficient way to feed you this information? \n3. Daniela Bin, she is the ultimate gatekeeper that I know and might be willing to help with reposting and with the right message attached, like One of Keith's long time mentees. Talented guy looking for some help insight, please share...\" Or something could make it go really far to influential people at another level.\n4. Posts in LinkedIn groups that people actually care, like in my School and Fraternity groups.\n5 I've engaged with a lot of recruiters in the past 2 years. Along with others in my network regarding job search efforts. I think personal outreach to them would be important, but there are a lot, so might be copy/paste type thing if can't be automated before then. "
