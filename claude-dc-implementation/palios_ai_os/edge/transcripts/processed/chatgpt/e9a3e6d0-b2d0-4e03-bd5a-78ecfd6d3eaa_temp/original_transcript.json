    "Right now, you can\u2019t directly upload videos here for analysis, but there are a few workarounds:\n\n### **Option 1: Upload to a Public or Private Link**\n- Upload the video to **Google Drive, Dropbox, or YouTube (unlisted)**.\n- Share the link here, and I\u2019ll analyze it.\n\n### **Option 2: Extract Key Frames**\n- If you can, **take screenshots** of the most interesting moments and upload them here.\n- I can analyze the **context, expressions, and framing** for viral potential.\n\n### **Option 3: Describe It**\n- If you explain **what happens in the video, how long it is, and any reactions from people or Chewy**, I can still give insights.\n\nLet me know how you want to proceed!"
