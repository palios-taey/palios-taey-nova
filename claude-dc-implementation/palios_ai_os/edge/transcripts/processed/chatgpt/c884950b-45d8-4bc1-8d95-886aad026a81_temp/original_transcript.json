    "I'm trying to understand your capabilities for reading long documents and retention within a chat. Ideally, I would be able to load a document of previous chats and you would be able to review it completely, like every word and retain it. I already submitted a couple versions of my resume. Were you not able to retain those? What percentage of the long chat documents were you able to review? Because it doesn't seem like you're able to reference that info. "
