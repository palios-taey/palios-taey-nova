I went through a similar one from July 2023 to April 2024. I ended up going a different route - I found a local business for sale that was interesting, successful, and whose product/service cannot be outsourced (either to a cheaper labor market, or AI). The past year has included 2 major hurricanes, but I have zero regrets. Wishing you the best going forward.\n\nThis guy was a lawyer at Caterpillar when I was there. "
