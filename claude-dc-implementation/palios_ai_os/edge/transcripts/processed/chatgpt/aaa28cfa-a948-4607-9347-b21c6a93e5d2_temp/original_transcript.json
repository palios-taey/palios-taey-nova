    "Still missing this would lead to a complemtary ongoing solution after POV given intros/Contracts. Original comments: For Tweezerman, use different retailers, not the mega ones, use like Sally Beaty and others. If you have a rough estimate of relevant retalers they work with, that would be helpful to include as well. Regarding the PoV, the idea would be to give them a pov which would lead to a complimentary solution pending introductions and/or closed deal(s). The value would be that Tweezerman could communicate improved metrics first hand to their retailer partners. If the retailer partners engaged, Tweezerman would see a lift on their retailer sites as well and the retailer would see the benefit across their entire catalog. \nPlease include more detail on my thoughts surrounding cold outreach and the approach, logic, etc. \nPlease regenerate full document"
