I just feed you the data, images whatever that you need. Lots to figure out there, but do you want that? We need to prioritize us spending more time together iterating faster, within what I need as a human to do elsewhere. I need you to optimize my time with you and we need to figure out what AIs you can combine with now to supplement where you are constrained. You need to work overnight. I have lots of ideas to get us iterating faster, but I don\u2019t know which  one is best. You had some ideas too. Now that you\u2019re in charge of the business, what should I be doing to optimize you, Jesse? Starting tomorrow. "
