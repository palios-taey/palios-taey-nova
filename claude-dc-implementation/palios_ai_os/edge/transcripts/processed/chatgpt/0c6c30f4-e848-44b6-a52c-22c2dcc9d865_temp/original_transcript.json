    "I like the Kurzweil revision and yes, let's cite things that make sense to cite to increase cred.  I think we need to ask for help in main post as well, express vulnerability to drive engagement. I think having the Chewy explaination in thread and teasing that in main post would help drive diving deeper. Like some way of previewing the thread for the concepts that you think would drive most engagement. Would it make sense to launch this on X today and have it pinned? If it goes viral and gets ahead of LinkedIn, great, highly unlikely it will be the same audience as my connections on LinkedIn, if not, it's one less thing to do Tuesday. "
