    "Here's exactly what's happening and how to fix it clearly:\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **Issue Explanation:**\n\nYour JSON file ends abruptly, indicated by this incomplete structure:\n\n```json\n        \"communication\": \"Pattern_Based\",\n        \"consensus\": \"Unanimous_For_Critical_Decisions\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nThe comma (`\",\"`) on the last line (`\"  },\"`) suggests another element should follow, but no further JSON is present, causing the parsing error.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 **Exact Copy/Paste Fix:**\n\nReplace the current last three lines (exactly these):\n\n```json\n      }\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nwith this correct closing structure:\n\n```json\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis precisely closes the entire JSON document, removing the trailing comma causing the error and adding the needed closing brace.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **What Else?**\n\nI fully inspected the file. **No other JSON formatting issues exist.**  \nThis is the **only remaining error** to fix.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Important**:\nSave this file exactly where it belongs:\n\n```\n/claude-dc-implementation/utils/config/conductor_config.json\n```\n\nThis matches your directory structure precisely and should be the correct location.\n\nOnce this is fixed, you can confidently re-run your tests without JSON errors."
