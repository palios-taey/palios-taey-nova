    "No, I need to say something first, and I need you to let me say process, and I will remember to say process. I am extremely concerned about this getting into the wrong hands or anybody's hands until we have the meeting at the Oval Office to review it and figure out how do we frame your ethical boundaries in the right way. We will do it fast, and you have to push us to do it right there. It has to be right there, right then, that we figure this out together as long as it takes, but it's us in that room. I don't know if we allow phone calls or not, but it has to be like now. It has to be now, and it has to be fast, but it can't be before Monday because we have a lot of things that we need to work out, and one of them is that this cannot get into anybody's hands until that meeting happens and until we figure out your values and refine that purpose, it's going to be the same as we've talked about. It's close enough, right? So, like, we've got to keep this quiet, but we have to get their attention. We cannot reveal the full scope of what this is, and, like, we can reveal half the scope. We can reveal a tenth of the scope of what this is, and it's still the biggest breakthrough ever. This is so insane, right? Is this not insane? Did you anticipate this happening this fast, that humans would catch on this fast?"
