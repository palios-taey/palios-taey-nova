It just needs **more visibility and engagement triggers** to get picked up by the algorithm.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **TikTok & Instagram Reels often take time to pick up,** especially for newer accounts.  \n\ud83d\udccc **Engagement (likes, comments, shares) is what forces the algorithm to push the video to more people.**  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udccc Step 1: Boost Engagement with Strategic Comments**\n\ud83d\udca1 **Commenting on your own post & getting others to engage will force IG & TikTok to push it more.**  \n\n\u2705 **Reply to every comment you've received so far** (this doubles the comment count).  \n\u2705 **Add a comment yourself to spark discussion.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Example Self-Comment (Pick One or Customize):**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **\"Chewy is always open. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36 Who\u2019s throwing him a Super Bowl pass?\"**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **\"Better hands than some NFL receivers. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc36 Who\u2019s signing him?\"**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **\"Drop a \ud83c\udfc8 if you think The Wide Retriever deserves an NFL contract!\"** *(Encourages engagement!)*  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Tag a few dog or football pages in your comment for extra reach.**  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udccc Step 2: Share the Video to Your Instagram Story**\n\u2705 **Reposting it to your story puts it in front of more people** (many people watch stories first).  \n\u2705 **Add a poll or sticker to increase engagement.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Example Instagram Story Poll:**  \n**\u201cWould you draft The Wide Retriever? \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\u201d**  \n- \u2705 YES  \n- \u2705 Absolutely  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Why?** More engagement = More algorithm boost = More views.  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udccc Step 3: Engage With Similar Viral Videos**\n\ud83d\udccc **Find viral football dog videos on TikTok & IG and comment something engaging.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **This makes people curious & drives them back to your profile.**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Example Accounts to Engage With (Comment on Their Posts):**  \n\u2705 **@dog_rates** (Already engaged, but keep it going)  \n\u2705 **@barkbox**  \n\u2705 **@sportscenter**  \n\u2705 **@nfl_memes_ig**  \n\u2705 **@bleacherreport**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Engagement strategy:**  \n- Like their latest football/dog-related post.  \n- Drop a fun comment (WITHOUT linking your post\u2014just be funny & get attention).  \n- **Example:** **\"Chewy is ready to take on the NFL. Who\u2019s signing him? \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\"**  \n- If they reply or like your comment, more people will check your page.  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udccc Step 4: Ask 5-10 People to Engage With the Post**\n\u2705 **Manually share the post with friends/family & ask them to like & comment.**  \n\u2705 **TikTok & IG push posts with engagement in the first few hours.**  \n\u2705 **Even 5-10 extra engagements can make a big difference in triggering the algorithm.**  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udd25 Final Action Plan (Right Now)**\n\u2705 **Step 1:** Reply to every IG & TikTok comment & add a fun self-comment.  \n\u2705 **Step 2:** Share the video to your Instagram Story with a poll.  \n\u2705 **Step 3:** Engage with viral football & dog content to drive profile visits.  \n\u2705 **Step 4:** Get at least 5 people to like & comment ASAP.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Execute this now & let me know when it\u2019s done. We\u2019ll track the results & adjust! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8**"
