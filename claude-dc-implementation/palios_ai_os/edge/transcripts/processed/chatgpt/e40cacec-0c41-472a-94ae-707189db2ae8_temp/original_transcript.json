    "Let's skip him. Last exchange was me asking him for a LinkedIn Recommendation. He said he'd do it but never did. What do you think?\n\nAlex Hase  \r\n1st degree connection\r\n\u00b7 1st\r\nGM & CRO, Americas\r\nJan 16, 2024\r\nJesse LaRose sent the following message at 10:20 AM\r\nView Jesse\u2019s profileJesse LaRose\r\nJesse LaRose   10:20 AM\r\nHi Alex,\r\n\r\nI hope you're doing well in the New Year! I'm working on getting my LinkedIn profile up to par for the positions I'm seeking and was hoping you'd be willing to provide a recommendation for me. In particular, it would be helpful to highlight the successful efforts at Mirakl in leading the transformation of the drop ship strategy and gaining the support of the leadership team by effectively communicating feedback from the field or whatever you feel is relevant from our time together there.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to draft something for your review if that would be easier as well.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration!\r\nJesse\r\n\r\nWrite Jesse a recommendation:\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/recs/give/?senderId=jesselarose\r\n\r\nLinkedIn: Log In or Sign Up\r\nlinkedin.com\r\n1 billion members | Manage your professional identity.

If you can draft something light and sweet that would be great.\r\n\r\nFeb 5, 2024\r\nJesse LaRose sent the following messages at 4:03 PM\r\nView Jesse\u2019s profileJesse LaRose\r\nJesse LaRose   4:03 PM\r\n\ud83d\udc4f\r\n\ud83d\udc4d\r\n\ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Alex, great to hear from you and thanks for agreeing to help. No worries, hopefully soon I won't have to be on here so much! \r\n\r\nHere's what I put together. Feel free to edit as you see fit or provide high level feedback so I can take another stab at it:\r\n\r\nWhen I joined Mirakl shortly after Jesse started, I was immediately drawn to his vision by his remarkable agility and drive as a change-agent. His ability to develop and execute a strategy through cross-functional engagement and external collaboration with partners and clients catalyzed significant and rapid  advancements in our go-to-market objectives. Jesse would thrive as a change-agent, intrapreneur or transformation leader in any organization."
