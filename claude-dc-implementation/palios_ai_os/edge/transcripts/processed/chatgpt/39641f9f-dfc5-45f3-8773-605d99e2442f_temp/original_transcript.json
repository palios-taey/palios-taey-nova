    "Here's precisely what's wrong in the latest version of your JSON and how to exactly fix it (copy/paste ready):\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **Exact issue**:\nYou're missing a comma at line 1027 after the closing brace (`}`), which separates it from the next JSON structure.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 **Exact copy/paste fix**:\n\nReplace these lines at the very end (lines 1026\u20131028):\n\n```json\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nwith the corrected version (add a comma after line 1026):\n\n```json\n      }\n    },\n  }\n```\n\n**Explanation**: The comma is mandatory here because JSON objects or key-value pairs must always be comma-separated if they appear sequentially. This is exactly why the error \"`Expecting ',' delimiter`\" appeared.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Exactly how the final lines should look (copy/paste this directly)**:\n\n```json\n        \"communication\": \"Pattern_Based\",\n        \"consensus\": \"Unanimous_For_Critical_Decisions\"\n      }\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter applying this correction, your JSON configuration will load successfully.\n\nYou can confidently apply this fix and rerun your tests."
