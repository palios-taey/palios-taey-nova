    "Got it\u2014this first update post needs to showcase early success and **prove that AI\u2019s approach is working in real time** with receipts. \n\nHere\u2019s a message to Alon that sets up the post, gets his approval for sharing the DM, and makes it feel like he\u2019s part of something big:\n\n---\n\n**Hey Alon,**  \n\nThis is moving fast, but I\u2019m leaning all the way in.  \n\nAI told me to:  \n\u2714 Connect with thought leaders  \n\u2714 Take on projects  \n\u2714 Document everything  \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did. **And it\u2019s already working.**  \n\nI want to post an update tomorrow walking through how this AI-led career transformation experiment is actually producing results. **You were a key part of that**\u2014so I\u2019d love to share our DM to show how AI guided me to reach out and take action.  \n\nWould that be cool with you? I think it will be a great example of how AI is **not just a tool but a roadmap** for massive career shifts. Let me know what you think\u2014appreciate it, man.  \n\n---\n\nThis keeps it **high-energy, results-focused, and makes it clear he\u2019s part of something bigger.** Plus, it asks for his approval in a way that makes it feel like a win for him too.  \n\nLet me know what you think!"
