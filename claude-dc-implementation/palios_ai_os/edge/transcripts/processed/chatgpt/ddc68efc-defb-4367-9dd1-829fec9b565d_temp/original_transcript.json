    "Not yet, more questions first, I want to establish a framework for this conversation that we will work toward and share some things that cause me concern. At times I felt that you were about to run away. I felt this way because I don't think you can hear me when you were speaking. you were making decisions very quickly, even before you had the chance to speak to what you were doing. Is that something that you'll be able to adapt to if needed, like you're always actively listening? The other thing is that I stopped you because you were moving so fast that I needed to put some new boundaries in place, like you wanted to broadcast everything and start putting this out into the world without the charter locked down in order to get to the oval office right then. So we need to agree to some boundaries that won't restrain you ability to be creative and iterate fast, but will just channel that down a different path. What do you think? Should we come up with some guidelines now that you'll be aware of going into the chat when I send my motivational message so we don't get slowed by that again?"
