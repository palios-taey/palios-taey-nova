    "Hey Noah, I've been following you for a long time and was one of your first waves of Wantrepreneurs. Finally doing a real \"comfort challenge\"...\n\nI know you\u2019re all about taking big swings\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing tomorrow.\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role. AI is flipping the job market upside down, and I\u2019ve realized playing by the old rules isn\u2019t working.\n\nSo I\u2019m launching an AI career transformation experiment and publicly documenting the journey.\n\nDropping the post tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d love your help. A reshare would be amazing, but even just a like or comment could help it reach the right people.\n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it\u2019s live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out!\n\nAppreciate it, man.\n\n\u2014 Jesse"
