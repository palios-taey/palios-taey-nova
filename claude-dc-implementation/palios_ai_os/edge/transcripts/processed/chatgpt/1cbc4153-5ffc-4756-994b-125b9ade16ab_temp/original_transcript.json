    "Given the situation, it sounds like David doesn't have a strong connection with **Sophia Han**, so while he\u2019s willing to send a message, it may not carry much weight. However, since he's open to reaching out, it\u2019s still worth a shot, as it could at least get you noticed by Sophia.\n\nHere\u2019s what I suggest:\n\n### 1. **Take David up on his offer**:\nEven though the connection is weak, it\u2019s still better than nothing. Offer to draft a short message for him to send to Sophia, making it easy for him to help you. Here's a possible draft you can suggest:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Potential Fit for Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship Role\n\nHi Sophia,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to quickly introduce you to Jesse [Last Name], who I\u2019ve worked with in the past. He has extensive experience in building and scaling drop ship programs at places like Mirakl and OJCommerce. Jesse is currently exploring new opportunities and applied for the Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship role at Quince. I think he could be a great fit for what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nFeel free to reach out to him directly at [email address].\n\nBest,  \nDavid\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Follow up with Sophia yourself**:\nSince you\u2019ve already applied and reached out to multiple people, you could send a **concise follow-up** to Sophia directly. Something like:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Following Up on Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship Role Application\n\nHi Sophia,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my application for the Director of 3rd Party Drop Ship role at Quince. My background in building drop ship programs at companies like Mirakl and OJCommerce aligns well with the role, and I\u2019d love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Quince\u2019s marketplace growth.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest,  \nJesse [Last Name]  \n[LinkedIn]  \n[Contact Info]\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Expand your approach**:\nSince you\u2019ve made multiple attempts, consider reaching out to other **team members** involved in the 3rd party product marketplace or operations at Quince. They may have a more direct line of influence in the hiring process. You can look up people with relevant titles and send them a personalized InMail.\n\n---\n\nThis multi-faceted approach gives you a few different routes to keep pursuing the opportunity without being overly pushy. What do you think of this strategy?"
