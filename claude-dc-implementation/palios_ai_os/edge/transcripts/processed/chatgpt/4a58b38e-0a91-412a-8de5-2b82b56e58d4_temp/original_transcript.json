    "So, these are my top priorities:\n1. Get Chewy's accounts set up and determine plan (today)\n2. Do the LinkedIn post to network on journey so far and what I'm looking for going forward. I'm thinking of sharing some details of this conversation and plugging Chewy there. (tomorrow after content is posted)\n3. Ongoing management of Chewy, job applications/outreach and AI based learning based on how each evolve (i.e. if Chewy blows up, then will obviously focus on that). \n\nWhat do you think?"
