But what if it's much closer? AI is already reasoning, designing its own improvements, and replacing white-collar jobs at an accelerating rate. The leap from ChatGPT just two years ago to today\u2019s models is massive\u2014but the next leap will make that progress look slow in comparison. If AI keeps advancing at this pace, the world as we know it is about to change much faster than expected.\\n\\nIt almost feels like all we need is something to link AI to the brain\u2014maybe call it 'BrainLink' (I\u2019m terrible at branding, but maybe someone really smart with a lot of money will figure that out?). If I don\u2019t embrace AI now, I risk getting left behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not just adapting to it\u2014I\u2019m letting it guide me.\"}]}"
