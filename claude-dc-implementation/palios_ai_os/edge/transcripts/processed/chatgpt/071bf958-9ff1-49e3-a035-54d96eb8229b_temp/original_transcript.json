    "Given the financials and insights from the FDD, here are some strategic questions to ask Andy to clarify potential financial and operational expectations. I\u2019ve also included questions based on potential concerns, so you can assess whether this franchise aligns well with your goals:\n\n### Key Questions for Andy\n\n#### **Revenue Potential and Financial Performance**\n1. **Top Quartile Performance**: \u201cWhat are the specific factors that set top-performing franchises apart from others? Are there particular strategies, locations, or operational differences that consistently drive revenue above $1 million?\u201d\n2. **Expected ROI Timeline**: \u201cBased on your experience with new franchises, what is a realistic timeline to achieve positive cash flow and recover the initial investment?\u201d\n3. **Consistency of Revenue**: \u201cHow stable are the revenues month-to-month? Are there seasonal fluctuations or regional trends that affect franchise performance in affluent markets like Boca Raton?\u201d\n\n#### **Operational Requirements and Support**\n4. **Onboarding and Training**: \u201cCan you walk us through the initial training and onboarding process? What support does Pet Wants provide to help new franchisees hit the ground running and reach revenue targets faster?\u201d\n5. **Time Investment**: \u201cWhat is the typical time commitment required in the first year to reach optimal operations? What about after the franchise stabilizes?\u201d\n6. **Supply Chain and Inventory**: \u201cAre there any common supply chain challenges in sourcing the specialized products, especially if there are shortages or increased demand? How does Pet Wants help franchisees manage inventory costs and availability?\u201d\n\n#### **Market Differentiation and Consumer Appeal**\n7. **Unique Selling Proposition**: \u201cWhat is Pet Wants\u2019 primary differentiator in the pet food industry, especially compared to larger pet brands or other local boutique pet food suppliers?\u201d\n8. **Consumer Demand in Affluent Areas**: \u201cHave you observed higher demand in high-income areas like Boca Raton? What unique strategies would you recommend to target and retain a high-end customer base?\u201d\n\n#### **Marketing and Brand Support**\n9. **Marketing Initiatives**: \u201cWhat marketing support do franchisees receive from Pet Wants at the national level? Are there effective local marketing tools or best practices, particularly for affluent markets, to build a loyal customer base?\u201d\n10. **Social Media and Digital Marketing**: \u201cHow can Pet Wants support us if we develop a unique marketing strategy, such as using our dog\u2019s social media following to drive interest? Is there flexibility for franchisees to engage in customized marketing campaigns?\u201d\n\n### Specific Concerns to Address\n\n#### **Low Current Franchise Count and Franchisee Satisfaction**\n11. **Franchisee Feedback and Performance**: \u201cAre there existing franchisees we could speak with to understand their experience with Pet Wants? Has Pet Wants conducted any recent satisfaction surveys or received feedback from franchisees?\u201d\n12. **Franchise Growth and Expansion Plans**: \u201cGiven that Pet Wants doesn\u2019t have a large network of franchisees yet, what are the brand\u2019s plans for expanding and supporting the franchisee community in the next few years?\u201d\n\n#### **Financial Support and Risk Mitigation**\n13. **Financial Assistance and Flexibility**: \u201cDoes Pet Wants offer any financing assistance or partnerships with lenders for initial setup costs? Are there areas where they might be open to negotiation on terms or fees for new franchisees?\u201d\n14. **Exit Strategy**: \u201cWhat options are available if we decide to exit the franchise after a few years? Has Pet Wants facilitated resales for franchisees in the past, and what does that process look like?\u201d\n\n#### **Unit Economics and Territory Rights**\n15. **Territory Exclusivity and Competition**: \u201cWhat exclusivity rights would we have in the Boca Raton area? How is competition handled if another franchise wants to open nearby?\u201d\n\n### Overall Concerns After FDD Review\n\n- **Revenue Variation Across Quartiles**: There\u2019s a notable revenue gap between top and bottom quartile franchises. It would be essential to understand the success factors for achieving higher revenue and the realistic challenges that prevent some franchisees from reaching these levels.\n- **Franchisee Network Size and Support**: The limited number of franchisees could mean fewer shared resources and collective experience to draw on. While this can indicate room for growth, it also raises concerns about community support and feedback loops.\n- **Supply Chain Stability**: Given the niche nature of Pet Wants\u2019 products, supply chain issues could pose risks, especially during demand spikes or market fluctuations.\n\nArmed with these questions and concerns, you\u2019ll be better positioned to assess how well Pet Wants aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Let me know if you\u2019d like more guidance on any specific area or follow-up questions!"
