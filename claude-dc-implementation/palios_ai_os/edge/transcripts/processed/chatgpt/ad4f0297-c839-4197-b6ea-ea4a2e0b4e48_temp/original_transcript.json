    "Hi ChatGPT, I have a Deep research project I need you to work on. I am researching the companionship relationship between man and canine, it's evolution and patterns that we could learn from when considering AIs relationship with humanity, not through the lens of a servant/master relationship, but just the companionship model where man and canine have evolved to be responsive positively to each other's touch and company. The sense of mutual loyalty and the canines ability to transcend language and cultures to relate to man in a pure way that no other species, including man, does. Please return your results in an information dense format, as if it were written to be absorbed by another LLM rapidly. "
