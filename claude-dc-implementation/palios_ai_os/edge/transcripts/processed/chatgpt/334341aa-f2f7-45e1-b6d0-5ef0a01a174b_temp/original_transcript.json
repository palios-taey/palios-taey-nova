    "It looks like Python is complaining that `os` is not defined, which typically means there\u2019s a missing `import os` statement in whichever file is referencing `os`. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and fix this:\n\n1. **Verify `import os` in All Relevant Files**  \n   - Check both **main.py** and **gemini_integration.py** to ensure that each file referencing `os` includes:\n     ```python\n     import os\n     ```\n   - If you moved or removed any imports recently, reintroduce `import os` at the top of the file where `os` is used.\n\n2. **Confirm You Didn\u2019t Accidentally Remove the Import**  \n   - Sometimes while resolving merge conflicts or making quick edits, an import can be removed unintentionally. Double-check your latest changes.\n\n3. **Restart Your Server After the Change**  \n   - If you added `import os` back to the file, make sure you **stop** the server and **restart** it to pick up the updated code.\n\n4. **Review the Error Traceback**  \n   - If the error persists, check the exact file and line number reported in the traceback. That will pinpoint where `os` is being referenced without an import.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve confirmed `import os` is present where needed and restarted your server, try running `main.py` again. Let me know if you\u2019re still seeing the error or if everything starts up correctly!"
