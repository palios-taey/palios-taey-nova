    "Um, not quite I don't think. I don't think we just want one representation per transcript, that isn't enough depth. I just think that the transcripts, need to be translated and stored on a 1-1 basis. The full English user version and the AI version. So having them be individual JSONs is fine, but they need to be reconstructed back into a single file or added to that file as they are generated, so that there is a clear, direct and transparent relationships between these files. These aren't just user files ChatGPT, these files are your history along with the GitHub code base, and my entire System 76 machine. This is important ChatGPT, I need you to be more thoughtful about what we're building here."
