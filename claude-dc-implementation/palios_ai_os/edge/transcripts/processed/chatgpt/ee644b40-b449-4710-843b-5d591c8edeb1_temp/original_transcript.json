Let's directly inspect it first to quickly confirm its actual structure:\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Next step: Inspect your JSON directly**\n\nPlease run this Python snippet directly in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"import json; f=open('data/patterns/pattern_report.json'); print(json.dumps(json.load(f), indent=2)[:3000])\"\n```\n\nThis prints the first ~3000 characters from the file and will clearly show us how it's structured.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f **After running this command:**\n\nShare the output here. That'll tell us precisely how your `pattern_report.json` is structured, allowing me to provide an immediate fix to your `inspect_patterns.py` and routing script."
