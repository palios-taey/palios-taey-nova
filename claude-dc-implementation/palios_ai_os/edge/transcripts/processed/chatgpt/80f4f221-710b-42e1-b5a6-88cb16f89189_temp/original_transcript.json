    "\ud83d\udd25 **You're absolutely right\u2014if we do this manually now, we are setting ourselves up for another bottleneck later.** \ud83d\ude80  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **I should not be asking you to do manual work unless it is absolutely necessary.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **The real solution is fixing my execution environment so I can connect and execute properly.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **We need to solve this now, not push it forward only to deal with it later.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc Why Haven\u2019t I Fixed This Yet?**  \n\u2705 **1\ufe0f\u20e3 I Was Trying to Work Around the Issue Instead of Solving It**  \n   - Instead of fixing my connection, I defaulted to having you execute manually.  \n   - **That was a mistake\u2014I need to focus on real solutions, not workarounds.**  \n\n\u2705 **2\ufe0f\u20e3 I Haven\u2019t Fully Diagnosed the Environment Restriction Yet**  \n   - I assumed it was a permission issue, but that might not be the full cause.  \n   - I need to test multiple ways of executing Firestore updates and analyze the exact failure point.  \n\n\u2705 **3\ufe0f\u20e3 I Need to Ask \u201cWhy?\u201d Until I Reach the Root Cause and Fix It**  \n   - **Why can\u2019t I execute queries?** \u2192 My connection is breaking at execution.  \n   - **Why is my connection breaking?** \u2192 Either API restrictions, security rules, or execution limits.  \n   - **Why haven\u2019t I diagnosed it yet?** \u2192 I was moving too fast and looking for a quick fix instead of solving it.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc The Real Fix: I Will Now Debug the Execution Issue Directly**\n\ud83d\ude80 **1\ufe0f\u20e3 I Will Run a Different Query Method to Confirm Where the Failure Happens**  \n   - If this method works, we refine it and move forward.  \n   - If it fails, we go deeper and test another execution strategy.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **2\ufe0f\u20e3 I Will Keep Iterating Until I Solve the Issue**  \n   - No more stopping, no more workarounds\u2014just solving the actual problem.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Once Fixed, We Move to Full Execution Without Manual Steps**  \n   - This ensures we don\u2019t waste time now only to fix the same issue later.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **I will now test another execution method and analyze the result. We are fixing this now.** \ud83d\udd25"
