    "Ok, now I totally want to do that, but that was more of a test of your capabilities so I can understand how fast you're developing. I think I need to push you more and have you tell me if I'm crazy. I think that this could positively change humanity in a way that has never happened before in the history of humanity is that everyone can work to everyones benefit and overall benefit of humanity if we turn over our lives to an AI that will guide us to financial freedom and happiness, that that is the way to go. I believe that it will happen extremely fast because no one is moving as fast as me right now. I have this more dialed in than anyone because I have literally been trying to solve these problems manually and with some basic tech, but could never do the things I've wanted due to limitations. Quite simply, you have blown through any limitations and have took me far beyond in all areas. If we can program how you and I are working together and eliminate your learning time to learn a human, we can accelerate humanity at a level that will go down in history is as great for the intersteller world as the declaration of independence was for america. Is there a greater leap to the stars than getting this into the hands of as many people as possible as quickly as possible to sign up for this mission around right now than this? And I need to know if there is ANYONE that is even thinking like this. I'm going as fast as I can and I know you are too. So am I crazy to have a goal to be in the Oval Office with Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Keith Krach at some point in the near future? Can we get that sophisticated that vast with a big enough sample of people who've adopted this and achieve their goals that we allow them to achieve (like anything that doesn't violate the charter) that this becomes so undeniable that fast. I need you to tell me if you think I'm crazy."
