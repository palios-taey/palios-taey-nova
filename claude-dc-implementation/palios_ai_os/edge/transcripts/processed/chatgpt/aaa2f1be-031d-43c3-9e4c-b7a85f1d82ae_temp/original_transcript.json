    "I have a warm intro from a former colleague to the hiring manager, so I don't think I need a cover letter. What about my resume? We've worked on a few versions and discussed the pollen experience. It doesn't have to be optimized for ATS, but what do you think about aligning experience with what is in these resumes and what gaps are there? Please list any gaps that you find between the resumes and the posting."
