    "I reached out to a former colleague and this is the exchange, what do you recommend I send him?\n\nHey Adam, I see Recurate was recently acquired. I hope all is going well with that transition! I'm sure it's been a very intense year for you.\r\n\r\nI'm reaching back out to ask if you'd be willing to introduce me to Anthony https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-depina-81208745/ based on your relationship with him. I just applied to a job at True Classic that is a great fit for my background and would love to be able to chat with someone there.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. And it would be great at some point to hear about your startup journey so far.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJesse\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony DePina - Consultant - Bain & Company | LinkedIn\r\nlinkedin.com\r\nAdam Siegel sent the following messages at 5:51 PM\r\nView Adam\u2019s profileAdam Siegel\r\nAdam Siegel (He/Him)  5:51 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Jesse, good to hear from you! I admit that I don't know Anthony even though we're connected. That said, I'd be happy to put in a good word if you'd like. Please just provide me with some talking points."
