    "Yes, **Ray Kurzweil has updated his predictions.**  \n\n- He originally predicted **2029** for AI **matching human intelligence** (general AI).  \n- **2045** is when he predicts the **Singularity**\u2014where AI surpasses human intelligence exponentially and merges with humans.  \n\nSo **2029** is still his timeline for **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**\u2014AI as smart as a human in all areas. That\u2019s what we\u2019re referencing in the post.  \n\n\ud83d\udd17 [Source: Kurzweil on 2029 AGI prediction](https://futurism.com/the-byte/kurzweil-strong-ai-2029)  \n\nWant to keep this in the post as-is? Or tweak for clarity?"
