    "### **Responses to Your Questions:**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Implementation Status Dropdowns**:  \n\u2705 The correct dropdown values should be **\"Completed, In Progress, Not Started\"** \u2013 I\u2019ll update my sample data accordingly.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Do I Need to Put Files, Links & Transcripts In?**  \n**Short Answer:** No, not at this stage.  \n\ud83d\udd39 The **Source Link** field is there for reference and indexing, so adding an actual URL is ideal but not required yet.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Files & Media** can be attached later if needed (for personal content like PDFs).  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Full Transcripts/Text** are only necessary if we plan to run AI queries on them for deeper indexing. For now, a short **summary + key takeaways** is sufficient.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Do We Need \u2018Creator\u2019 as a Separate Field?**  \n\u2705 **Agreed \u2013 It's redundant.** The **Influencer/Source** field already creates a linked entry, so there\u2019s no need for a separate \"Creator\" field. Let\u2019s remove it.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **I\u2019ll refine the sample data to match the correct dropdown options** and remove redundant fields.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Double-check retrieval functionality inside Notion** \u2013 Once the entries are in, test filtering by **Tags, AI Research, and Implementation Status** to ensure queries work correctly.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Validate that relations (AI Influencers, AI Research, PKD) function correctly** and provide expected results when clicking through related records.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Are you ready to move forward with the next table, or do you want to validate the Knowledge Vault retrieval first?**"
