    "### **Step 19: Fix Windows Not Allowing Python to Execute `.CMD` Directly**\n\u2705 Since `shutil.which(\"gcloud\")` correctly finds `gcloud.cmd`, this confirms that **Windows recognizes the executable**, but **Python subprocess isn\u2019t treating `.CMD` files as directly runnable**.\n\nNow, we will **configure Windows to always allow `.CMD` execution within Python subprocesses**.\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Step 19.1: Force Windows to Recognize `.CMD` in Python Subprocess**\nSince Python **fails to run `gcloud` without `shell=True`**, but finds `gcloud.cmd`, we will explicitly tell Windows to treat `.CMD` as executable.\n\n#### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Manually Set `PATHEXT` to Include `.CMD` for Executables**\n1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**  \n   - Press **`Win + R`**, type **`cmd`**, and press **`Ctrl + Shift + Enter`**.\n\n2. Run This Command to Force Windows to Recognize `.CMD` as Executable:\n```cmd\nsetx PATHEXT \"%PATHEXT%;.CMD\" /M\n```\n\ud83d\udc49 This ensures that **Python subprocess can execute `.CMD` files like `.EXE` or `.BAT`**.\n\n3. **Restart Your Computer**  \n   - This allows Windows to apply the changes.\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Step 19.2: Test Python Subprocess Again Without `shell=True`**\nAfter restarting, try running this Python script **without `shell=True`**:\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ntry:\n    output = subprocess.run([\"gcloud\", \"--version\"], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)\n    print(\"\u2705 gcloud is working inside Python without shell=True!\", output.stdout)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"\u274c gcloud is still NOT found in Python.\")\n```\n---\n\n### **Next Steps Based on Output**\n- \u2705 **If `gcloud` now works, the issue was Windows not treating `.CMD` files as runnable in subprocess.** \ud83c\udf89  \n- \u274c **If `gcloud` still fails, we will modify Python's execution policy to allow `.CMD` natively.**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Let me know what happens after these steps! \ud83d\ude80**"
