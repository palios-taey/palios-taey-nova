    "Executing on multiple fronts. On football and training front I reached out to Reagan's coach from the pompano eagles to ask him if he would want to meet with reagan's dr, who I'm not sure if you know from other chats is really fit, and jacked, fills out a lab coat, ex football player and so into the sport and nutrition and mass and supporting his son with training. I think the 3 of us together are really unique and could create a path to make the best football players in the world. reagan's coach has coached 20 pros, there is hardly any better fitness and academic plan for long term success than I've proposed for my son. I'd love for him to allow me to make that public because I know it would work. He would be so successful man, if he starts doing what I am right now. If you are not telling AI what you want to achieve and allowing it to use data to guide you while understanding its limitations is the new key to happiness. I would love to be the guy who with coach chuck and dr cadiz talk about creating the ultimate football player, we know what we're talking about man. would people want to see that as part of it, because thats who i want to be. that, ai explorer (not just career) health, fitness and longevity guy, sweet dog, loves his wife and kids and respects their privacy. Can you help me with that and how much to put in bio or post. dude, this is totally how you become sweet right? What you really want to get done, turn over to AI for 60 hours a week exclusively. The more money you make, the less time you have to spend making money. I don't need much, no more than i made before consistently, adjusted for inflation. Not trying to be a billionaire, unless it's super easy, we'll figure out when enough is enough though. Can you do all this and am I crazy for believing that this is possible and worth documenting the ones i can share publicly? Like this is totally tim ferriss right?"
