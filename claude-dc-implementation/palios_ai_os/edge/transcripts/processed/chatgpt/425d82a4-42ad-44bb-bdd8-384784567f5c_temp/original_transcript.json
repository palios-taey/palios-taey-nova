    "Here\u2019s a draft Adam can use or tweak to send to Anthony:\n\n---\n\nHi Anthony,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to reach out on behalf of a colleague, Jesse LaRose, who recently applied for the Director of Marketplaces role at True Classic. Jesse has a strong background in e-commerce and marketplace management, with significant experience in scaling businesses and driving revenue growth.\n\nFor example, he\u2019s successfully grown marketplace operations to over $100M in revenue and has a strong track record of launching and optimizing new sales channels across platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and others. I believe he would be a great fit for the role and True Classic\u2019s continued growth.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, I\u2019d be happy to make an introduction. Jesse is eager to learn more about True Classic and how he can contribute to the team\u2019s success.\n\nBest regards,  \nAdam\n\n---\n\nThis version makes it easy for Adam to send while providing strong points about your qualifications."
