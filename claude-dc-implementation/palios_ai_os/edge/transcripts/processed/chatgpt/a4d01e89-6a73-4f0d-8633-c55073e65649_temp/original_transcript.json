    "**Clarifying integration needs**\n\nOkay, the user's asking me to try again and follow my own advice, which is to produce a structured message for Gemini. I need to clearly outline our integration requirements, role assignments, expectations for collaboration, and where communication improvements need to happen \u2014 like simpler and clearer layering, role demarcation, and pre-validating understanding.\n\nI'll use the provided template to create a clear JSON structure, explaining our needs and asking for specific details to ensure alignment with the MVP+ sprint objectives."
