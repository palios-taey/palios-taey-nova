So I\u2019m letting AI decide my future.**\\n\\nBeing unemployed this long has been brutal for me and my family. If you\u2019ve been in this situation, you understand. If you haven\u2019t, I hope you never have to\u2014but with the rapid advances in AI, more white-collar workers will face the same struggle.\\n\\n### **\ud83e\udde0 The AI Job Market is Changing\u2014Fast**\\n\\nI followed all the \\\"best practices\\\"\u2014tailored resumes, networking, LinkedIn optimizations, outreach, referrals. **Nothing worked.**\\n\\nI upskilled, learning **data analytics\u2014SQL, Tableau, visualization tools.** But AI can already do 80-90% of these jobs. Y Combinator\u2019s investment target list for 2025 is almost exclusively AI to eliminate white-collar roles. This isn\u2019t five years from now\u2014**it\u2019s happening today.**\\n\\nThe last two years of AI progress have been mind-blowing. But if you understand **exponential growth**, the next two years won\u2019t be another leap forward\u2014it will be the equivalent of all progress made since the dawn of computing. No one knows what that will look like.\\n\\n### **\ud83d\udd39 So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?**\\n\\nI stopped assuming I had the answers. I asked AI:\\n\\n*Given everything you know about me after working on this for two years\u2014what should I do? Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it.*\\n\\nIt told me to:\\n\\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Learn AI automation & implementation** to help companies integrate AI.  \\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Use AI to optimize my own job search** and publicly document the process.  \\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Monetize my dog on social media.** Yes, really.  \\n\\nThat last one sounds crazy. But I had already explored a **pet franchise business** and discussed my dog's potential as a brand asset due to his unique abilities. AI reframed this as a **low-risk, high-reward** way to learn social media, experiment with AI automation, and explore an alternative income stream\u2014while simply sharing something I already do. Even if it doesn\u2019t take off, the skills will still be valuable.\\n\\n### **\ud83d\ude80 The Experiment: Let AI Guide My Next Career Move**\\n\\nRather than resisting AI, I\u2019m embracing it. **AI will dictate how I allocate my time** based on feedback from this post, my job search efforts, and business automation case studies. I\u2019ll be sharing:\\n\\n\ud83d\udccc **AI-powered job search automation and outreach**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **How AI can replace or enhance traditional business processes**  \\n\ud83d\udccc **Experiments with AI-driven content growth**  \\n\\n### **\ud83d\udd39 How You Can Help**\\n\\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you know of AI-driven roles where I can help companies adopt, implement, or optimize AI tools, let\u2019s talk.** My background aligns with:\\n\\n- **AI Implementation & GTM Strategy** (AI Solutions Consultant, AI Adoption Specialist, GTM Strategy Lead)\\n- **AI-Powered Process Automation** (AI Workflow Strategist, AI Automation Consultant, Business AI Specialist)\\n- **AI-Driven Growth & Revenue Strategy** (AI Growth Strategist, Revenue Ops AI Lead, AI-Powered Sales Enablement)\\n\\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Engage with this post.** Like, comment, or share\u2014it will help me reach the right people.\\n\\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **If you love dogs, check out Chewy\u2019s channels.** If AI is right and he goes viral, it could help sustain my family while I transition careers.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc36 **Follow The Wide Retriever:**  \\n\ud83d\udccd **Instagram:** [Insert IG handle]  \\n\ud83d\udccd **TikTok:** [Insert TikTok handle]  \\n\ud83d\udccd **YouTube Shorts:** [Insert YouTube handle]  \\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 **This is an experiment in AI, career transformation, and content.**\\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 **I\u2019ll also be sharing this on X (Twitter). If that\u2019s your preferred platform, follow along here:** [Insert X handle]  \\n\\n\ud83d\udcac **Have you ever taken AI\u2019s career advice? What\u2019s the most unexpected thing it has suggested?** Let\u2019s discuss.\\n\\n*(Attaching Chewy\u2019s latest video\u2014because if AI is right, this might be part of my future too.)*\"}]}"
