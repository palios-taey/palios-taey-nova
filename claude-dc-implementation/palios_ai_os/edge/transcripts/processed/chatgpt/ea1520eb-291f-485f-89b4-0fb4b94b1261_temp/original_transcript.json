    "This is a solid post\u2014Zac Hays is clearly getting traction because he\u2019s speaking directly to the **massive shift AI is forcing on product management and development workflows.**  \n\nIf you want to engage, **a comment could be a good way to jump into his audience**, especially since he has **1,800+ reactions and 266 comments.** You\u2019d be adding to the discussion **without forcing an ask** but could naturally bring in your experiment.  \n\n### **Comment Suggestion (Engagement First, Not an Ask)**  \n**\"This is exactly what I'm seeing across industries\u2014AI isn't just a tool for speed, it's fundamentally changing how we work and who does what. The shift is happening so fast that traditional hiring models and job search methods are already breaking.  \n\nI\u2019ve been deep in AI-driven automation and experimentation after two years of seeing firsthand how the job market is shifting faster than people realize. The most in-demand people aren\u2019t the ones who \u2018know how things work\u2019\u2014it\u2019s the ones who are **actively adapting in real time.** This post nails it.  \n\nCurious\u2014what\u2019s been the biggest surprise so far in using AI this way? What\u2019s something you **thought** would be valuable that now feels obsolete?\"**  \n\n### **Why This Works**\n\u2714 **Adds Value to the Discussion** \u2013 You're not just talking about yourself; you're reinforcing his key points and adding your own AI-driven experience.  \n\u2714 **Drives Engagement** \u2013 The last two questions invite responses. This increases the chance of **Zac replying, which pushes your comment higher** in visibility.  \n\u2714 **Subtly Teases Your Experiment** \u2013 You don\u2019t need to plug your post yet\u2014if the conversation flows, you can mention it later or if Zac is curious, **he might check out your profile and post naturally.**  \n\nIf he responds, **you can take it further and then ask if he\u2019d be open to resharing your experiment if it aligns.** But **the first step is getting visibility in his audience.**"
