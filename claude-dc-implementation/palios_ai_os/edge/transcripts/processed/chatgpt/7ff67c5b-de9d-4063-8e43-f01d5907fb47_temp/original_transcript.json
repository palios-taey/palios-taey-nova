If AI can fill it, it will. If AI is unsure, it prompts for human input.\\n- **\u2705 Manually Required** = A human must enter this field manually. AI can assist but cannot determine the value on its own.\\n- **\u274c Not Required** = The field is optional and does not block usage.\\n\\n---\\n## **Knowledge Vault - Property Definitions & Requirements**\\n\\n### **Purpose of the Knowledge Vault**\\nThe **Knowledge Vault** serves as a structured repository for all long-form content, including books, research papers, articles, videos, podcasts, and other media that contribute to decision-making and knowledge accumulation. It acts as a reference hub that enables AI-enhanced retrieval, indexing, and synthesis of information from various sources while ensuring alignment with strategic goals, principles, and personal knowledge overrides.\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **Property**                | **Type**         | **Required?**  | **Description** | **Comments/Questions** |\\n|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\\n| **Name**                    | Text            | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | The title of the knowledge entry (Book, Article, Podcast, etc.). | - |\\n| **Tags**                    | Multi-select    | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Categorization for filtering and indexing. | If AI misclassifies, should human override be logged? |\\n| **Media Type**              | Select          | \ud83d\udfe6 Required  | Type of content (Book, Article, Podcast, Video, etc.). | AI can usually infer from source format. |\\n| **Creator**                 | Relation (AI Influencers) | \ud83d\udfe6 Required | Pulls the name from AI Influencers table.
