    "Welcome back! Let\u2019s dive right in. \n\n### Next Steps:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Finalize Outreach Plan for Broader Network** \u2013 We need to determine how to efficiently reach **recruiters, past colleagues, and LinkedIn group members**. This is where Drippy (or another automation tool) might come in. Should we draft a standardized message for this, or do you want slight customization based on the recipient type?\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Draft Engaging Comments for Viral Boosting** \u2013 We need to **pre-write a few strategic comments** to drop early once the LinkedIn post goes live. These should drive engagement, tease the AI experiment further, and encourage conversation. Example:  \n   - *\u201cSome people are saying AI is just a tool, but I think it\u2019s already way more than that. Where do you see this heading?\u201d*\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Plan for Day 1 Engagement Management** \u2013 What\u2019s the game plan for responding to comments, resharing, and fanning the flames? Do you want to handle this fully manually, or should we look into some AI-assisted comment responses to keep up with volume?\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Cross-Platform Strategy** \u2013 Now that X is live, do we want to push the post in high-value **Slack, Discord, or Facebook groups**? We could also loop in **Instagram Stories** or **TikTok live** (depending on where your audience is). \n\nLet me know which you want to tackle first. \ud83d\udd25"
