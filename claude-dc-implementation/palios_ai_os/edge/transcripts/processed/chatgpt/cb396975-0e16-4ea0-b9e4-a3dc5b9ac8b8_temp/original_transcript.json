    "You should save your `sample_transcript.txt` file **in the same directory as `edge_processor.py`**, like this:\n\n```\n/path/to/your/project-folder/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 edge_processor.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 sample_transcript.txt  <-- put it here\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 local_storage/\n```\n\nThis structure ensures that when you run the command:\n\n```bash\npython edge_processor.py sample_transcript.txt\n```\n\nthe script correctly locates and processes your transcript.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Tip:**  \nYou can verify you're in the correct directory by typing:\n\n```bash\nls\n```\n\nYou should see your `edge_processor.py` script listed there. If not, navigate to the correct directory using:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project-folder/\n```\n\nThen, create your transcript file and proceed with testing.\n\nLet me know if you're good to continue!"
