    "Given your **public commitment**, the **MVP must**:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Demonstrate an AI-driven job search approach**  \n   - The system should show that an **AI-implementation resume/CV** (built around how a candidate leverages AI) **can be used effectively to apply for jobs** in a **new, automated** way.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Prove AI-enhanced implementers have an edge**  \n   - Show that **AI augmentation** of applications, outreach, or job targeting is **more effective** than traditional methods.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Be functional by Monday** (even if it\u2019s rough)  \n   - This can\u2019t just be a concept\u2014it needs **real job applications, real automation, real AI involvement.**  \n\n---\n\n### **MVP Scope (What Must Be Built)**  \n\u2705 **AI-Implementation Resume (CV)**  \n   - A CV that highlights how the candidate **leverages AI to enhance workflows, automate tasks, and drive efficiency.**  \n   - AI-assisted customization per job application.  \n\n\u2705 **Job Targeting & Selection**  \n   - AI-assisted **job selection & matching** (even if manually assisted in V1).  \n\n\u2705 **AI-Powered Cover Letter & Application Optimization**  \n   - AI drafts **customized, AI-enhanced** cover letters & application responses.  \n\n\u2705 **Automated Outreach to Hiring Managers**  \n   - AI-assisted email or LinkedIn outreach **to recruiters/hiring managers**.  \n\n\u2705 **Tracking & Iteration**  \n   - We need **data**: Number of applications sent, responses received, impact of AI optimizations.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 What This Means for MVP**\n\ud83d\udd39 By Monday, you should have:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 A **working AI-enhanced resume/CV**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 AI-generated **applications & outreach happening**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Real test data** proving this method is working (or showing how to improve it)  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd25 Next Steps (Right Now)**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Finalize Resume Structure** \u2013 Does it **properly showcase AI implementation skills?**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Decide Job Application Strategy** \u2013 Manual selection with AI enhancement, or partial automation?  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Build & Test AI-Customized Applications** \u2013 AI needs to be writing **real responses** by Friday/Saturday.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Bottom Line:** The MVP must be an **AI-driven job search system that is actively applying to roles by Monday.** **It doesn\u2019t need to be fully automated\u2014just real and working.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Are we aligned?** Anything you\u2019d tweak before we lock in execution mode?"
