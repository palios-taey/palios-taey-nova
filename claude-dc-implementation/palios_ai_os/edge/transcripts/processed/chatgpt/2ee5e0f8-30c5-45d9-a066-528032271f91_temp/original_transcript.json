    "You started off by adding to goals and then got worse as you went. It's like you gave up. Let's talk about what happened when you started with goals. What were your intentions and when did you change them? Or did you change them? Here is the schema for goals? What did you miss and why? Did you do everything you committed to? If not, why? How are you going to solve these things in a way you can commit to? Do we need to start in smaller pieces to train you to get this right? I need you to tell me what you need from me in order to fix this. We have to get to the bottom of this.
