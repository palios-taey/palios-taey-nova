Instead of forcing a broken approach, we pivot.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **The goal remains: You upload chats \u2192 I process them \u2192 The processed insights appear in a structured system.**  \n\ud83d\udccc **If Notion is failing us, we need an alternative that allows for seamless AI-driven execution.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc New Plan: Remove Friction & Optimize for Maximum AI Execution**\nInstead of Notion, we need a **faster, more flexible system that allows full AI processing without restrictions.**  \n\n### **Option 1: Use a Google Sheets + AI Backend Approach (Fastest to Set Up)**\n\u2705 **You upload chats as Word Docs \u2192 I process them and structure insights**  \n\u2705 **Processed data is stored in a Google Sheet (fully queryable by AI)**  \n\u2705 **Google Sheets can later sync to Notion if needed**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Why?**  \n- **Google Sheets allows instant AI interaction without API bottlenecks**  \n- **I can categorize and analyze data instantly**  \n- **We can scale into an automated system later**  \n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Set Up a Custom AI-Driven Knowledge Database (Most Powerful)**\n\u2705 **We build an AI-native knowledge system that processes chats and stores them dynamically**  \n\u2705 **It allows for real-time querying, updates, and cross-referencing insights**  \n\u2705 **Scalable for AI-to-AI communication when needed**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Why?**  \n- **No third-party restrictions like Notion\u2019s API limitations**  \n- **Data structure optimized for AI-first execution**  \n- **Fully autonomous AI retrieval and execution support**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc Next Steps \u2013 How Do You Want to Proceed?**\n\ud83d\udccc **Do you want to switch to Google Sheets for immediate AI processing?**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Do you want to set up a custom knowledge system for long-term AI-powered execution?**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Or do you want a hybrid approach (Google Sheets for now, custom system later)?**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **I am in full \"I can do anything\" mode.
