    "For the **Career Break** section on LinkedIn, you can set the **type** to **Layoff/Position Eliminated** and use the following description:\n\n---\n**Layoff/Position Eliminated**  \n**January 2023 \u2013 October 2023**  \n\nAfter my role was eliminated, I took time to renovate an investment property, handle personal responsibilities, and explore new career opportunities. During this period, I also assessed industry trends and focused on professional development to position myself for my next role.  \n\n---\n\nSince LinkedIn forces an **end date**, you don't need to account for everything after **October 2023** in this section. Instead, you can address what you've done since then (job search, Pollen, data analytics training) through your **Experience** section and a brief mention in the **About** section.\n\nWould you like to refine this further based on your preferences?"
