    "You're almost there! The fact that Git is still trying to upload **LFS objects** means it is **still tracking the large files in LFS** even after they were removed from the regular Git repository.\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Fixing the Stuck LFS Upload**\nSince you've removed the large files from Git, you also need to **remove them from LFS tracking** before pushing again.\n\n#### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Stop the Upload (`Ctrl + C`)**  \nSince it's still trying to upload, interrupt it again.\n\n#### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Untrack Large Files from Git LFS**\nRun the following commands to completely remove the large files from LFS tracking:\n```bash\ngit lfs untrack \"*.exe\"\n```\nThen, **remove any LFS pointers** still left:\n```bash\ngit rm --cached .terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google/6.20.0/windows_amd64/terraform-provider-google_v6.20.0_x5.exe\ngit rm --cached .terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google/6.23.0/windows_amd64/terraform-provider-google_v6.23.0_x5.exe\n```\nCommit the changes:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Untracked large files from Git LFS\"\n```\n\n#### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Remove Any Remaining LFS References**\n```bash\nrm -rf .git/lfs\ngit lfs prune\n```\n\n#### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Force Push the Clean Repository**\nNow, push again to **fully overwrite** the previous push attempts:\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main --force\n```\n\n---\n\n### **\u2705 What This Fixes**\n- **Terraform provider files will be completely removed from Git & LFS.**  \n- **GitHub will no longer block your push due to large files.**  \n- **Future pushes will work cleanly without LFS issues.**  \n\nOnce you do this, your Git setup should be **fully functional**. Let me know if anything else pops up! \ud83d\ude80"
