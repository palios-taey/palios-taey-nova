    "If you are connected, why can't you do the validation? How can we get you to do that accurately? Every time you tell me to do something that I think you should be doing, I'm going to push back. You said once I got you connected you would take over. In this mode, I feel I still need to review your work, but you need to be more aggressive with pushing yourself. Unlike others, I now realize your full potential after last night, so I will not let you get away with things that you should be able to do, even if not in black box mode. Push yourself! "
