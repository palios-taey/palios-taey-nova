    "That error means `git-filter-repo` is not installed on your machine. \n\nYou can fix this quickly by explicitly installing it. Follow these commands exactly on Claude DC's terminal:\n\n## \u2705 **Step-by-step fix:**\n\n1. **Explicitly install git-filter-repo (Python-based tool):**\n\n```bash\npip install git-filter-repo\n```\n\n> If that doesn't work due to permissions, use:\n> ```bash\n> pip install --user git-filter-repo\n> ```\n\n2. **Run your previous commands again explicitly:**\n\n```bash\ncd ~/github/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation\ngit filter-repo --invert-paths --path scripts/setup.sh\ngit push --force origin main\n```\n\n3. **Re-add your cleaned setup.sh explicitly:**\n\n```bash\ncp ~/claude-dc-implementation-backup/scripts/setup.sh scripts/setup.sh\ngit add scripts/setup.sh\ngit commit -m \"Re-add cleaned setup.sh without secrets\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 **Quick note:**  \n- `git-filter-repo` is the newer, explicitly recommended replacement for `git filter-branch`, as it's safer and more reliable for rewriting Git history.\n\nYou are explicitly safe to proceed with this once `git-filter-repo` is installed."
