    "Yes, it might be worth re-evaluating Pet Wants, especially if your goal is to reach a $150K income target more quickly. If you're drawn to the pet industry and would enjoy the community involvement at events or markets, **Pet Wants could still be a rewarding venture**, but it may require a longer-term perspective on profitability and growth. \n\nHere are a few questions to consider if you're still interested in Pet Wants:\n\n1. **Local Market Demand**: Are there sufficient pet owners in your area who would consistently buy premium, natural pet products? Conducting local market research could give you a clearer sense of potential demand.\n\n2. **Event Opportunities**: Could you supplement income with recurring events, partnerships with local pet-related businesses, or collaborations with veterinarians or pet groomers? If event-based sales can be ramped up quickly, this could help bridge the gap to a faster revenue stream.\n\n3. **Long-term Vision**: If you\u2019re comfortable with a slower ramp-up but want to establish a community presence and have a passion for the pet industry, Pet Wants may still align well with your interests. It would likely take longer to hit the income goal but could eventually become a steady business with a loyal customer base.\n\nHowever, if your primary focus is quicker scalability and financial return, **it may make sense to focus on franchises like Kidokinetics** that align with your skills in athletics and coaching, have immediate demand in schools and community programs, and offer a faster path to high income. This choice would balance your family\u2019s interests with income potential and timeline."
