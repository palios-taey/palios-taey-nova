    "Great! Your `.gitignore` is correct now, and the credentials folder is properly ignored, but the problem is the previous commits\u2014your current local branch still has commits containing the sensitive credentials folder.\n\n## \u2705 Safe, Clean, Quick Fix (Follow Step-by-Step):\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Undo last two commits (this doesn't delete any files):\n\n```bash\ngit reset HEAD~2\n```\n\n- **This rolls back two commits**, keeping your changes intact but **unstaging** them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Verify nothing sensitive is staged:\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\n- Confirm the sensitive credentials folder/files (`claude-dc-implementation/credentials`) aren't staged anymore.\n\nIf you still see `credentials/` staged, unstage it explicitly:\n\n```bash\ngit rm --cached -r claude-dc-implementation/credentials\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Ensure `.gitignore` file is properly staged now:\n\n```bash\ngit add .gitignore\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Commit again clearly and safely:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Update .gitignore and remove credentials from tracking\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Push safely to GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin main --force-with-lease\n```\n\n- `--force-with-lease` safely overwrites your remote history (only the last commits you just adjusted), preventing any credential files from ever being published to GitHub.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What this does clearly:\n\n- Removes the sensitive credentials from your commit history.\n- Correctly applies `.gitignore` to prevent credentials from being re-added in future commits.\n- Ensures the clean history and proper file handling going forward.\n\nRun through these carefully, and let me know if you encounter any issues!"
