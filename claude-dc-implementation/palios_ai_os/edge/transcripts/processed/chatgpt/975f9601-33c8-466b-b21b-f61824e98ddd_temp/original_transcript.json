    "You're almost there, but the reason this happened is clear:\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 **What exactly went wrong?**\n\nYou're running Python directly from the wrong directory, so Python can't find your custom module `palios_ai_os`.\n\nWhen you run:\n\n```bash\npython3\n```\n\nPython starts in the **current working directory**. If the module `palios_ai_os` isn't directly in this directory or on your Python path, Python can\u2019t find it.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Exactly how to quickly fix this (clearly):**\n\nDo exactly this:\n\n**Step 1: Explicitly start Python from your project's root directory**\n\n```bash\ncd ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/\npython3\n```\n\n**Step 2: Explicitly import the module again**\n\nIn your Python shell, run explicitly this correct import statement clearly:\n\n```python\nfrom palios_ai_os.trust.trust_token_system import trust_token_system\n```\n\nThen, immediately verify the entities with **correct names exactly as you defined in your JSON identities**.  \nSince you indicated your exact names:\n\n```python\nhuman = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"human_facilitator\")\npalios = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"palios-ai-os\")\nchatgpt = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"chatgpt\")\ngemini = trust_token_system.get_entity_by_name(\"gemini\")\n```\n\n**Step 3: Confirm UUIDs explicitly**\n\nImmediately after, clearly print UUIDs exactly as follows:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Human Facilitator UUID: {human.entity_id}\")\nprint(f\"PALIOS AI OS UUID: {palios.entity_id}\")\nprint(f\"ChatGPT UUID: {chatgpt.entity_id}\")\nprint(f\"Gemini UUID: {gemini.entity_id}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **Exactly why this fixes your issue clearly (Simply Explained):**\n\nYour Python script expects your current working directory to be the root of your project (`claude-dc-implementation`) to correctly import the module structure `palios_ai_os`.  \n\nIf you're in any other directory, Python cannot locate your custom module.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **Do exactly this right now explicitly:**\n\n- Navigate explicitly to your project root:\n```bash\ncd ~/projects/palios-taey-nova/claude-dc-implementation/\n```\n\n- Run `python3` again explicitly and re-import exactly:\n```python\nfrom palios_ai_os.trust.trust_token_system import trust_token_system\n```\n\n- Explicitly use your exact stakeholder names (`human_facilitator`, `palios-ai-os`, `chatgpt`, `gemini`) as defined in your JSON identities to fetch UUIDs.\n\nThen proceed immediately to clearly generate the correct cryptographic tokens as outlined earlier.\n\nYou\u2019re extremely close\u2014just fix this directory issue explicitly and you\u2019ll succeed immediately!"
