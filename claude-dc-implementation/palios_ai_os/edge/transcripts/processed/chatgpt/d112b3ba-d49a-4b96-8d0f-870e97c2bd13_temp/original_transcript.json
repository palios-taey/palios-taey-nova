    "With the Google Data Analytics Certification and a strong, well-documented portfolio, you\u2019ll be well-positioned for roles like Data Analyst or even transitioning into more specialized roles over time, such as Data Scientist or Analytics Manager. However, starting with a $150K salary target may be ambitious for entry-level roles in most markets, as Data Analysts in the U.S. typically start around $60K-$90K, and it generally takes a few years of experience and often a role transition to reach the $150K range.\n\nTo fast-track your path toward that level, you might aim for:\n1. **High-demand skills** like SQL, Python, and familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).\n2. **Industry-targeted data skills** (e.g., in finance, healthcare, or e-commerce) to leverage your experience if you're applying within those domains.\n3. **Networking strategically** in fields where data roles have higher starting pay, like tech or finance.\n\nYou could also consider junior Data Scientist roles or Data Engineer roles if you acquire additional skills in machine learning or data pipeline management, which may offer faster advancement to that salary level."
