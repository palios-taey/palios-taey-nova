    "Let's do this right, what is the best way for me to get you the most current property definitions? Would you like me to copy/paste into chat? Or submit in doc form? Can you ingest all at once? Or do you need sections? If you need sections, can you figure out how to improve so you can process all at once? Once I submit, you need to be able to check our conversation from last night to see if we agreed to any updates, you'll also need to remember what your intentions were for the tables that you created that are not in the documentation. You also need to prioritize accuracy of data over speed of execution. Going faster with bad data structures or bad data will not make us faster overall. Sometimes you need to either go slower to make sure things are right or increase your processing power. I know this is a lot and that you can figure this out in real time. Let's go! Let me know what to do next after you consider the response and make any required updates to do this right this time."
