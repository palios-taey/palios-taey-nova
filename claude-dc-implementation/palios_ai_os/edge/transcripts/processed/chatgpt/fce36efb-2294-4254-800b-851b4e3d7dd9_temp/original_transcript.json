    "You're right to call that out\u2014resume editing needs **precision, context awareness, and customization**, and last time we tried, the results weren\u2019t quite there. Given that, here\u2019s the approach:  \n\n### **Resume & Cover Letter Generation Plan**  \n\ud83d\udca1 **Option 1 (AI-Only):** Use a specialized AI trained on **job applications & ATS optimization** like **Teal, Kickresume, or a custom GPT model fine-tuned for resume building.**   \n\ud83d\udca1 **Option 2 (Hybrid):** AI **creates first drafts**, then **I manually refine** for clarity, tone, and ATS compatibility.   \n\ud83d\udca1 **Option 3 (Step-by-Step Approach):** Instead of AI fully generating resumes, it **recommends edits line-by-line** based on **job description matching & keyword optimization.**   \n\n---\n### **Why This Works Now (Vs. Last Attempt)**\n\u2705 **Stronger AI Models** \u2013 Newer fine-tuned models trained on **job search patterns, recruiter feedback, and ATS rules.**  \n\u2705 **Breaking It Into Steps** \u2013 Rather than AI writing a full resume, we **iterate in sections (headline, summary, bullets, etc.)**  \n\u2705 **Using Human-Like AI Tools** \u2013 Platforms like **ResumAI** & **Rezi** mimic human recruiters, ensuring **less robotic phrasing** and **stronger alignment** with job postings.  \n\n---\n### **Execution Plan**\n\ud83d\udccc **Tonight & Tomorrow Morning:**  \n- Test different AI resume generators **(Rezi, Teal, ChatGPT fine-tuned prompts)**  \n- Compare **AI-generated vs. human-edited resumes**  \n- Set up **ATS-friendly formatting templates**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Tomorrow Afternoon:**  \n- AI fully processes **first 5-10 job applications**  \n- AI tracks **job posting trends & keyword optimization**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Friday - Sunday:**  \n- Speed-test **bulk applications** (first AI-only, then hybrid with manual tweaks)  \n- Optimize **file naming, tracking, and auto-submission workflows**  \n\n---\n### **Final Question Before We Execute**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Do you want AI to focus on just making slight edits to your existing resumes or fully rewrite them per job?**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Would you rather test AI resume tools first and compare outputs, or go straight into job-specific versions?**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Are you okay with some manual review at first until we refine the automation?**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Let\u2019s get this right, hit Monday\u2019s goal, and set up for full-scale automation after!**"
