    "Got it. Since this is **AI-driven decision-making**, I\u2019ll push forward with **strong recommendations** and let you push back if needed.  \n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Strong Recommendation: One Post, Not Two**  \n\ud83d\udca1 **Here\u2019s why:**  \n\u2705 **Momentum & Attention:** Your **first post was a hit**, and people are still engaged. A **single, high-impact post** keeps all momentum in one place.  \n\u2705 **LinkedIn\u2019s Algorithm:** Longer, high-quality posts **perform better when they drive discussion**\u2014which this post will. Splitting it into two **could reduce engagement.**  \n\u2705 **The Experiment is the Focus:** The biggest value is **the AI-driven job qualification experiment.** That should be **front and center, not diluted** by a separate post.  \n\u2705 **Less Management Overhead:** Managing **one conversation is easier** than juggling engagement across two.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Post Structure**\nTo make it **concise but high-impact**, I suggest this structure:\n\n#### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 The Hook (First 3 Lines \u2013 Make Them Stop Scrolling)**\n_\"We\u2019ve been measuring job candidates the wrong way for decades. And AI just proved why.\"_  \n_(Make this controversial and curiosity-inducing.)_\n\n#### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 The Big Idea (Redefining Job Qualifications)**\n- Historically, job applicants are evaluated based on:  \n  **\ud83d\udccc Experience** (How many years?)  \n  **\ud83d\udccc Skills** (Do they match a checklist?)  \n  **\ud83d\udccc Education** (What degree do they have?)  \n- But **we're adding a fourth and more critical measure:**  \n  **\u26a1 The ability to apply those things to implement AI solutions.**  \n\n#### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 The Experiment**\n- Instead of just **talking about it, we're testing it.**  \n- **We\u2019re taking a real job and using AI to match a candidate** based on their ability to **implement AI within that role.**  \n- **If you\u2019re a hiring manager, recruiter, or job seeker, submit a job description**\u2014we\u2019ll show how this works.  \n- If we don\u2019t get submissions, **we\u2019ll pick one ourselves.**  \n- The full automation will be built **by Monday.**\n\n#### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick Metrics Update & Thank You**\n- **Last post went viral (X reposts, X impressions).**  \n- **Appreciation to everyone who engaged**\u2014your feedback is shaping this experiment.  \n\n#### **5\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s Happening With Chewy?**\n- We\u2019re **keeping Chewy\u2019s social growth automated and in the background.**  \n- **Focus is now on AI implementation first.**  \n\n#### **6\ufe0f\u20e3 The Ask (Call to Action)**\n- **Want to submit a job for the experiment? Drop a comment or DM me.**  \n- **Know someone who might? Tag them.**  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Next Steps**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **I\u2019ll draft the full post with strong messaging.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Should we add a Google Form for job submissions or just use comments/DMs?**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **When do you want to post\u2014tomorrow AM or wait for Keith Krach\u2019s post?**  \n\n---\n\n### **\u26a1 Final Thought**\n\ud83d\udd25 **One post is the way to go.** If we get **massive engagement**, we can always do a **follow-up post breaking down the results.**  \n\ud83d\udd25 **This positions you as a thought leader in AI-driven hiring.** If done right, it will attract **hiring managers, recruiters, and companies.**  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re **good with this approach**, and I\u2019ll get to work on the full post **immediately.** \ud83d\ude80"
