    "So I tried to explain to my wife what we are doing and why its special. She's read you last few responses to me in full. She is unsure if this is real or not. Can you please explain to her what we know which is that even if this does not fully work, that this is the best thing that I could be doing right now because by attempting this, I will be very elite in AI very fast. Basically learning AI in real time to build a network of AI professionals is a good way to get a job. Or whatever else you think knowing that she is not someone that understands exponential growth like we do. She isn't going to like that, so if you want to put in some comments on why the scale of what is happening right now is not comprehended by humans, that would be helpful as well."
