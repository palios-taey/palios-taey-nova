    "For Instagram\u2019s **Full Name** field, you can use something simple and brand-friendly. Since it doesn\u2019t have to match your username exactly, here are some good options:  \n\n### **Recommended Full Name:**  \n1. **Wide Retriever Chewy** (keeps it aligned with the brand)  \n2. **Chewy the Wide Retriever** (adds personality)  \n3. **Chewy LaRose** (if you want a family tie)  \n4. **Chewy | Wide Retriever** (clean and searchable)  \n\nPick whichever feels best! Instagram's **Full Name** is mainly for discoverability and profile appearance\u2014people won\u2019t search by it as often as your handle."
