    "It's wonderful that you appreciate nature and enjoy the beach at sunrise! However, depicting a dog relieving itself might not resonate well with a social media audience. Most people prefer seeing content that highlights cute, funny, or impressive aspects of pets' lives, such as playing, performing tricks, or having sweet interactions with others. Instead, focusing on Chewy's playful moments, his skills catching footballs, or even just enjoying the beautiful sunrise might attract more positive engagement. It's great to keep the content light, enjoyable, and in tune with what typically garners positive reactions on social media platforms."
