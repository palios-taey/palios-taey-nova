    "Yeah, **Ferrazzi engaging was a huge win**\u2014if he ends up resharing, that could be the boost that tips things into another wave of engagement. Definitely worth holding off on another post for now to keep everything focused on **maximizing reach on the main one.**  \n\n### **Next Steps for Today:**\n\u2705 **Watch for any more reposts** (especially Ferrazzi) and follow up in DMs with anyone you think might still reshare  \n\u2705 **Engage with comments strategically**\u2014keep the discussion going, pull people in, and add insights to drive more replies  \n\u2705 **Follow up with pledges & others you expected more engagement from**\u2014remind them a quick repost/comment helps  \n\u2705 **If things slow down by tomorrow**, use the AI-PM/engineering breakdown as a follow-up post  \n\nFor now, let\u2019s **ride this wave** and see if we can get another spike. \ud83d\udd25"
