    "The original **MEDDICC** framework (sometimes written as **MEDDIC**) is a widely used sales qualification method, especially in complex B2B sales like those you encountered at Mirakl. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the standard elements:\n\n1. **Metrics**: The quantifiable value or ROI the customer expects from the solution (e.g., revenue lift, cost savings).\n   \n2. **Economic Buyer**: The person who has the ultimate authority to make the purchase decision.\n\n3. **Decision Criteria**: The specific criteria the customer uses to evaluate and select a solution (e.g., price, functionality, support).\n\n4. **Decision Process**: The steps the customer will follow to reach the decision, including timeline and stakeholders involved.\n\n5. **Identify Pain**: The specific problem or challenge the customer is trying to solve.\n\n6. **Champion**: An internal advocate who pushes the deal forward within the customer organization.\n\n7. **Competition**: Awareness and strategy to differentiate against competitors vying for the same business.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Incorporate MEDDICC at Mirakl:**\n\nYou could simply mention that you utilized this framework as part of your sales strategy. Here\u2019s a potential revision for the **Mirakl** section that incorporates the use of **MEDDICC**:\n\n---\n\n### **MIRAKL \u2013 Head, Drop Ship Operations**  \n**May 2022 \u2013 December 2022**\n\nLed the strategy and execution for a newly created drop ship platform for enterprise retailers, securing $100M+ in business value and driving top-level strategic initiatives.\n\n- Spearheaded end-to-end enterprise sales efforts, utilizing a variation of the MEDDICC framework to ensure deals were fully qualified and aligned with client needs, leading to faster decision-making and deal closures.\n- Collaborated with internal teams to refine product positioning and sales processes, ensuring consistent communication of value across metrics, decision criteria, and pain points.\n- Successfully closed deals with top-tier retailers by engaging economic buyers and champions within client organizations, while differentiating Mirakl\u2019s solution from competitors.\n- Leveraged Proof-of-Value (PoV) periods to demonstrate platform value, contributing to increased customer retention and satisfaction.\n\n---\n\nThis update mentions the use of MEDDICC without changing the original content too much. Does this fit with what you were thinking, or should I make any adjustments?"
