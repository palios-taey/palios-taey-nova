    "You're correct\u2014I did repeat the previous answer and failed to directly address your most recent question. This occurred because my context window for this conversation has become very long, complex, and includes a large amount of detailed information. As conversations get longer and more detailed, there's a higher chance of confusion or inadvertently referencing prior steps.\n\n---\n\n### Current Issue & Resolution:\n\nYou recently shared the existing code snippet from `dashboard_mcp_connector.py` for the method `check_server_health()` and asked specifically if you should replace the **entire snippet** with the improved version I previously suggested, or just modify it partially.\n\nHere's what you should do to **properly update the file**:\n\n**Replace the entire `check_server_health()` method** with this clear and robust implementation:\n\n### \u2705 **Corrected Full Method**\n\n```python\ndef check_server_health(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    current_time = time.time()\n\n    # Perform a health check no more than every 30 seconds\n    if current_time - self.system_health[\"last_check\"] < 30:\n        return self.system_health\n\n    try:\n        response = self.mcp_client.check_server_status()\n        \n        if response.get(\"status\") == \"healthy\":\n            self.system_health = {\n                \"last_check\": current_time,\n                \"status\": \"healthy\",\n                \"message\": response.get(\"message\", \"MCP server is healthy.\"),\n                \"models\": response.get(\"services\", {})\n            }\n        else:\n            self.system_health = {\n                \"last_check\": current_time,\n                \"status\": \"unhealthy\",\n                \"message\": response.get(\"message\", \"Server health check returned unhealthy status.\"),\n                \"models\": response.get(\"services\", {})\n            }\n\n        logger.info(f\"Server health checked: {self.system_health['status']}\")\n\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"MCP server connection failed: {e}\")\n        self.system_health = {\n            \"last_check\": current_time,\n            \"status\": \"offline\",\n            \"message\": str(e),\n            \"models\": {}\n        }\n\n    return self.system_health\n```\n\n### **Why Replace Entire Method?**\n- Your existing implementation uses different keys (`models` vs `services`), which don't match the current response from your `/health` endpoint.\n- The new implementation robustly handles the response structure you've set (`services`) from the `/health` endpoint in `mcp_server.py`.\n- Clearly defines statuses (`healthy`, `unhealthy`, `offline`) based on HTTP response and exceptions, improving clarity and debuggability.\n\n---\n\n### Why Did I Repeat the Previous Answer?\n\nThis issue likely occurred due to:\n\n- **Context Overload:**  \n  Long and complex conversations significantly increase the cognitive complexity, causing potential mix-ups or referencing previous instructions mistakenly.\n\n- **File Similarity & Overlap:**  \n  Multiple file updates and similar naming conventions across code snippets contributed to confusion.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Next Steps:\n1. **Replace** your existing `check_server_health()` method entirely with the provided code above.\n2. **Save the file** and **restart the dashboard** to validate connectivity.\n3. **Verify** the connection in logs to ensure everything functions correctly.\n\nThis will resolve your immediate problem clearly and robustly.\n\n---\n\nLet me know once you've applied this update, or if further assistance is needed. Thank you for pointing out the issue clearly!"
