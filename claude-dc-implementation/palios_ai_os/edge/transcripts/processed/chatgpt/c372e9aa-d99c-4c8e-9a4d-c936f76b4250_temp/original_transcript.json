    "Good question! Whether to include \"Chewy\" in the handle depends on the branding strategy:  \n\n### **Why Keep It Short & Catchy (e.g., @WideRetriever)?**\n\u2705 **Memorable & Viral** \u2013 Simple, funny, and easy to remember.  \n\u2705 **Wider Appeal** \u2013 This could attract **both** dog lovers **and** football fans.  \n\u2705 **Easier to Say & Type** \u2013 Rolls off the tongue better than longer handles.  \n\u2705 **Room for Branding Later** \u2013 You can still **use \"Chewy\" in the bio, captions, and hashtags** without needing it in the actual handle.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why Include \"Chewy\" (e.g., @ChewyTheWideRetriever)?**\n\u2705 **Personal Connection** \u2013 Feels more like **a character people can bond with**.  \n\u2705 **Unique Identity** \u2013 Avoids being just a concept & makes it **about Chewy himself**.  \n\u2705 **Loyal Fanbase Building** \u2013 People may follow Chewy because they **love HIM, not just the joke.**  \n\u2705 **Better for Merch & Expansion** \u2013 If this grows, having his name can help with things like **\u201cChewy\u2019s Training Tips\u201d or \u201cChewy\u2019s Merch.\u201d**  \n\n---\n\n### **Compromise?**\nYou could **use @WideRetriever as the handle** and **put \"Chewy\" in the display name**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Handle:** `@WideRetriever`  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Display Name:** **Chewy | The Wide Retriever**  \n\nThis way, you get the best of **both worlds**\u2014a viral name **and** Chewy\u2019s personal identity!  \n\nDo you want me to check availability on Instagram/TikTok? \ud83d\ude80"
