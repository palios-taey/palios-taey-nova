    "This indicates a direct conflict:\n\n- **`tensorflow-rocm`** requires **`protobuf < 5.0`**\n- **`grpcio-status`** explicitly requires **`protobuf >= 5.26.1`**\n\nThese two requirements cannot both be satisfied simultaneously, causing a conflict.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Recommended Resolution:\n\nIn practice, TensorFlow's compatibility is **higher priority** than `grpcio-status`. Typically, `grpcio-status` is less strict in actual use, and TensorFlow compatibility takes precedence.\n\nYou have two practical options:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Recommended Action (Preferred):\n\n1. **Keep the current setup** (`protobuf==4.25.3`), as TensorFlow and `streamlit` are typically more critical.\n2. **Uninstall or downgrade `grpcio-status`** (if not actively used in your implementation).\n\n```bash\npip uninstall grpcio-status\n```\n\nThen confirm dependencies are clean:\n\n```bash\npip check\n```\n\nIf nothing else depends explicitly on `grpcio-status`, this resolves the conflict cleanly.\n\n---\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Alternative (If you absolutely need grpcio-status):\n\nIf you explicitly need `grpcio-status >=1.71.0`, you may have to:\n\n- Revisit TensorFlow's dependencies (which could require more complex resolution).\n- Consider creating a separate virtual environment specifically for grpc operations.\n\nHowever, this is usually **not necessary** unless you're explicitly using advanced grpc functionalities with strict version requirements.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 Recommended immediate command:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall grpcio-status\npip check\n```\n\nThen, verify TensorFlow again to ensure GPU functionality:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nprint(\"GPUs available:\", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))\n```\n\n---\n\nThis will clearly and effectively resolve your current package conflict."
