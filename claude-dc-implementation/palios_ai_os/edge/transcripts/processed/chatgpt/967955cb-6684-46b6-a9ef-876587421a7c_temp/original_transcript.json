    "Let's knock in 1 first. So let's restate the goal here, we're trying to upend the current job application process to prioritize looking at how the candidate can use AI to amplify their education, skills and experience. First step I think is for you to review my resume, combined with additional information on my background, skills and experience provided in the 2 attachments, 1 which you have reviewed in detail. I think we need to ensure the resume still has the basics, but has additional information structured around the job listing about how to convey the AI multiplier effect for the position, which might include elimination of the position all together, or whatever percent of it. We need to help people understand that it's shifting from people to agents and that this is how you should be thinking. I think we get a version of my resume out there for a role that we identify that does this, that can be the teaser for tomorrow and then we can say working on implementation of x,y,z for Monday. What do you think? Be honest and provide guidance on how we approach"
