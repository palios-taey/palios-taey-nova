    "### **\ud83d\udcc5 Should We Track \"Updated Date\" Too?**\nGood thinking. **System metadata (last modified date) already tracks updates**, but there are cases where a **separate manual \"Updated Date\" field** would be useful.\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 When to Manually Track \"Updated Date\"**\n\u2705 **If AI Needs to Prioritize Recent Updates** \u2013 If we want AI to focus more on fresh insights vs. older ones  \n\u2705 **If We Need a Clear Revision History** \u2013 When a goal/knowledge entry significantly **evolves over time**  \n\u2705 **If We Want to Trigger AI Re-Evaluation** \u2013 Example: \"Hey AI, review everything updated in the last 30 days and adjust recommendations\"  \n\u2705 **If We\u2019re Making Manual Overrides** \u2013 If we **edit something for a reason that AI needs to be aware of**  \n\n---\n\n### **\u23f3 When NOT to Track Manually**\n\u274c **If We Just Need a Basic Timestamp** \u2013 The system already tracks last modified date  \n\u274c **If Changes Are Frequent & Trivial** \u2013 If we expect small edits but don\u2019t want to update the date manually  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Recommended Decision**\n- **Manually add an \"Updated Date\" field** in PKD, Goals, and Workflows  \n- **Purpose:** Lets us override system metadata if needed  \n- **Format:** Use a **Date property** (manually settable)  \n- **System metadata still tracks background edits**  \n\nThis gives us flexibility while keeping AI aware of intentional updates.\n\n**Sound good, or do you think metadata is enough?**"
