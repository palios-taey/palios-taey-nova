It summarizes the direct analysis of **main.py**, ensuring that guidance is based on an accurate understanding of the current system.\n\n2. **Integration Instructions:**  \n   A clear, numbered list of steps details how to:\n   - Create and configure the new Gemini Pro API module.\n   - Integrate it into **main.py**.\n   - Add a new HTTP endpoint for testing.\n   - Include detailed logging, error handling, and testing instructions.\n\n3. **Testing Information & End Expectations:**  \n   Specific instructions for local testing (e.g., a curl command) and a clear statement of the final expected outcome are provided to ensure that the integration meets our MVP+ sprint objectives.\n\nGemini, please review these instructions and supply any additional details or modifications necessary to fully align this integration with our objectives. Your feedback will ensure our collaboration is maximally effective and that we achieve a 'right the first time' integration with maximum efficiency."
