    "You're correct that LinkedIn's **Skills** section operates on predefined options. While I don't have access to the full current list of LinkedIn's skill tags, I can provide a tailored selection based on common, searchable options that align with your background.\n\nHere\u2019s a refined **Skills** list suggestion that should correspond to LinkedIn's standard skills:\n\n---\n\n1. **Strategic Planning**  \n2. **Cross-Functional Team Leadership**  \n3. **Process Improvement**  \n4. **CRM Implementation**  \n5. **Data Analytics**  \n6. **SQL**  \n7. **Tableau**  \n8. **E-Commerce**  \n9. **Marketplace Operations**  \n10. **SaaS Go-To-Market Strategy**  \n11. **Sales Operations**  \n12. **Revenue Growth**  \n13. **Vendor Management**  \n14. **Business Intelligence (BI)**  \n15. **Workflow Automation**\n\n---\n\nStart by adding the top 10, and then add more depending on how many LinkedIn allows for your profile (up to 50 skills total). The prioritization ensures you're visible for both technical and leadership roles, which aligns with your goal of broadening your opportunities.\n\nWould you like me to help prioritize which ones to add first, or do these already look good to you?"
