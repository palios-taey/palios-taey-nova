    "I'm glad we did this as I think we need to refine and clarify a couple things:\nPKD - my understanding of this was that when I override you, for cause based on a personal experience that you agree with (or don't) and I still override you, should be determined if 1 time or should be added to database. These examples don't seem to fit that. Let me know if you were thinking something different. Areas of agreement should not be in here because that means we are aligned. Sources you recommended putting in are in the first screenshot\n\nFor Relation fields, these need to be related to a specific entry in the linked table, so you need to be mindful of this in your sample data construction. It looks like I would need the name for each to link.\n\nUrgent should only be used in rare circumstances, like if something needs to be immediately actioned and everything else stopped. For things like something is broken resulting in financial loss, an AI insight came in that changes everything and needs to be addressed immediately or something very drastic happens. Let me know what you think about that and how you think it should be handled if you disagree. \n\nGoal, goals should follow a structure and we can create additional columns as needed. Typically, goals should contain owner, due dates and metrics. In this case, owner isn't required I don't think, but should contain a metric. These should be as metric focused as possible to allow you the flexibilty to determine the best path there. For example, my goal in the short term is to get to 15K/month profit. You'll figure out how and guide me.\n\nLast, I think we should start a canva with guiding principles for this build that will guide how it thinks, this includes the vision/mission statement and things like the goals comments above. Goals should be achieved by the direction you give within the constraints of my personal principles that are in that table. We can add things as we go to the canva to come up with a charter that we'll include as a document in here to guide the AIs that are utilizing this to make decisions (if that's possible). These are essentially custom instructions, so something like, AI is to be honest and truth seeking, not just being a yes man, or however that should be worded. This is serious, we need to take it seriously and do it the right way, not to say that you aren't, but this is next level shit right? \n\n\n\n"
