    "You **can** share your entire Google Drive, but **I don\u2019t recommend it** for a few reasons:  \n\n1. **Privacy & Security** \u2013 Your Drive likely contains personal or sensitive files unrelated to Chewy, and sharing everything could be risky.  \n2. **Easier Organization** \u2013 Having a dedicated **\u201cChewy Content\u201d** folder makes it simple for your family to **upload new content without sorting through unrelated files**.  \n3. **Faster Access** \u2013 A single folder means **no distractions**, and you can quickly find the best content for posting.  \n\n### **How to Set Up & Share a Google Drive Folder:**\n1. **Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)**  \n2. **Click \u201c+ New\u201d \u2192 \u201cFolder\u201d**  \n3. **Name it** something like **\"Chewy Content\"**  \n4. **Right-click the folder** and select **\"Share\"**  \n5. **Add my email** (or get a shareable link) so I can access it  \n6. **Make sure permissions are set to \"Editor\"** so you and your family can upload files directly  \n\nThis keeps things **clean, private, and efficient** while allowing me to help sort, tag, and suggest **which content to post first**. Once it\u2019s set up, just share the link with me! \ud83d\ude80"
