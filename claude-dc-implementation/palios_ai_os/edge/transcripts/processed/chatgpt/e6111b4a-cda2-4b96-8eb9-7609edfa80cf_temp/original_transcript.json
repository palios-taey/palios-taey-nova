    "Great plan! Once you get that **perfect profile shot**, we can swap it in, but for now, let\u2019s **keep moving forward**. \n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Finalize Banner Images for Each Platform**  \n   - The **profile pic is the face of the brand**, but the **banner is prime real estate** to show off Chewy\u2019s energy and personality.  \n   - Do you have a **wide shot of him in action**\u2014maybe mid-air catching the ball or running with it?  \n   - If not, I can help you create a **collage-style banner** with multiple images.\n\n2. **Plan & Draft the First Posts**  \n   - Let\u2019s set the tone for each platform.  \n   - Do you want the **first post** to be an **introductory post** (like \"Meet Wide Receiver Chewy!\") or jump right into an **awesome highlight video**?  \n   - We\u2019ll write captions, pick hashtags, and schedule the first few posts to **launch with momentum**.\n\n3. **Engagement & Growth Strategy**  \n   - Who should **Chewy follow**?  \n   - What\u2019s the **daily routine** for engagement?  \n   - Which **accounts should we interact with** to grow quickly?  \n\n**Where do you want to start from here?**"
