    "### **Where Does RAG Fit Into Tomorrow\u2019s Execution Plan?**\n\ud83d\udd39 **Short Answer:** We **don't fully implement RAG tomorrow, but we lay the groundwork.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Why?** Setting up the **retrieval pipeline manually first** ensures we build the logic properly before scaling up with RAG.  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc Where RAG Fits into the 12-Hour Plan**\n\u2705 **Morning (Governance & Retrieval Planning)**  \n- Ensure **structured AI memory retrieval works manually first.**  \n- Define **what data AI needs to retrieve, when, and how.**  \n- Confirm **retrieval logic works with Notion-based structured insights.**  \n\n\u2705 **Midday (AI Query Logic & Testing)**  \n- Set up **test cases** for retrieving insights from AI memory storage.  \n- Validate **retrieval accuracy before automating with RAG.**  \n\n\u2705 **Afternoon (RAG Planning & Execution Pipeline Prep)**  \n- Identify **data sources that will eventually need RAG-powered retrieval.**  \n- Define how **external AI sources (APIs, research papers, thought leader updates) will be structured in RAG.**  \n- **Ensure structured logging** (so AI retrieval isn\u2019t a black box).  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc When Do We Actually Implement RAG?**\n\ud83d\udca1 **Monday-Tuesday:** Once manual retrieval is confirmed, we shift to **RAG-powered automation** to scale retrieval.  \n- **First Priority:** AI should pull **structured Notion insights** correctly before we layer in external sources via RAG.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Tomorrow is about making sure retrieval & query execution works.**  \nOnce that\u2019s solid \u2192 RAG automates & scales it.   \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Final Question:** Does this approach make sense, or do you want to push for an earlier RAG integration?"
