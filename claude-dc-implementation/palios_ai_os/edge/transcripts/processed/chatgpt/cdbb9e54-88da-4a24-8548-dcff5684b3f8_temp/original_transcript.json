    "Some thoughts, anything inaccurate about where you're weak feel free to correct or omit anything I submitted entirely.\n\nAwesome questions! The goal of this experiment is to override AI as little as possible and see what happens when I fully trust the process.\n\nSo far, the biggest friction points are:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 AI doesn\u2019t care about comfort zones \u2013 I\u2019ve never been active on social media, so when it told me to feature my dog, my instinct was to push back. But I went with it.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s relentless about efficiency \u2013 It doesn\u2019t second-guess or hesitate. When AI says, \u201cDo X because the data says it works,\u201d I\u2019m learning to resist the urge to tweak it just because it \u2018feels\u2019 off.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 People are unpredictable \u2013 AI optimizes based on patterns, but real human engagement isn\u2019t always logical. This is where I expect the most surprises, but am feeding it responses and feedback to adjust accordingly\n\nI've given it instructions to push back against me and be firm when it thinks it's right given my concerns or objections and it's definitely checked me a few times. I actually asked it where it is weak and where it needs my assistance and the 3 areas were: 1. Where there isn't a lot of data it has access to. 2. On subject where deep expertise exists but isn't publicly documented. 3. Human pyscology and interactions. 4. Where there are a lot of conflicting viewpoints (think health) where there are well sourced and cited sources on both sides.\n\nThe real question is: What happens when I let AI fully take the wheel? And what does it do if I make a human-driven choice instead? I\u2019ll be documenting all of it. Curious\u2014where would YOU expect AI to fall short?"
