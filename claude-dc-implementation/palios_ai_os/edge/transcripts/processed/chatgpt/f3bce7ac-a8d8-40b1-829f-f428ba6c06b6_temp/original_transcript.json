    "Now that we\u2019re fully aligned, let\u2019s **talk through the LinkedIn post strategy and execution plan.**  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udd25 LinkedIn Post Strategy: The BIG Idea & Experiment**\n### **\ud83d\udd39 What This Post Needs to Communicate**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Big Idea:**  \n   - Traditionally, candidates are evaluated on **experience, skills, and education.**  \n   - But in the AI-driven world, **what matters most is the ability to apply those skills to implement AI solutions.**  \n   - We\u2019re **redefining work and the job search process** to reflect this shift.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **The Experiment:**  \n   - We are **going to test this new framework**\u2014by taking a real job and using AI to match a candidate based on their ability to **implement AI solutions within that role.**  \n   - **Companies & hiring managers**: If you have **a job opening, submit it.**  \n   - **Job seekers:** If you want to see how your role could be restructured, **submit a current job description.**  \n   - If we don\u2019t get submissions, **we\u2019ll pick a job ourselves and build the automation by Monday.**  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Post Metrics Update & Thank You:**  \n   - Quick recap of the **success of the first post** (reposts, impressions, engagement).  \n   - **Thank everyone** for being part of the conversation.  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Decision on Chewy:**  \n   - **Chewy remains a long-term play.**  \n   - **Focusing on AI implementation first.**  \n   - **Automating Chewy\u2019s content strategy in the background** for slow, organic growth.  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udd39 Key Decisions Before Posting**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **One Post or Two?**  \n   - **Option 1: One long, high-impact post.**  \n     - **Pros:** Keeps momentum, full engagement in one place.  \n     - **Cons:** Might be too much for one post, reducing engagement.  \n   - **Option 2: Two posts (one for the BIG idea & experiment, one for updates).**  \n     - **Pros:** Keeps AI strategy separate from personal updates, gets **more engagement over time.**  \n     - **Cons:** More to manage and might spread the impact too thin.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **How to Frame the Ask for Job Submissions?**  \n   - Should we **directly tag hiring managers and recruiters** for engagement?  \n   - Should we **use a poll to drive participation**?  \n   - Should we include a **Google Form for structured job submissions**?  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **What Do We Do About Keith Krach\u2019s Post?**  \n   - **Today is almost over.**  \n   - Should we **wait until tomorrow to check in with Daniela**?  \n   - Should we **delay our post slightly if Keith\u2019s post drops tomorrow**?  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\ude80 Next Steps**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Finalize the structure:** One post or two?  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Refine the \u201cAsk\u201d strategy:** Direct tags, poll, Google Form?  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Determine timing:** Do we post tomorrow or wait for Keith Krach?  \n\n---\n\n### **\u26a1 Brutally Honest Take**\n- **This post is going to be huge**\u2014it frames you as a **thought leader in AI & hiring transformation.**  \n- **We need to make sure the \u201cask\u201d is strong enough** to generate job submissions without sounding like we\u2019re just experimenting.  \n- **Keith Krach\u2019s post matters, but we shouldn\u2019t wait too long**\u2014we need to **own the momentum.**  \n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udd25 What Do You Want to Finalize First?**\n- **Should I draft the post right now?**  \n- **One post or two?**  \n- **What\u2019s the final call on the engagement ask?**  \n- **Do we check in on Keith Krach\u2019s post tomorrow?**  \n\nLet\u2019s lock this in so we can **execute FAST. \ud83d\ude80**"
