    "I can't directly analyze the videos from Google Drive, but if you can upload **shortlisted** videos here one by one, I can assess them and help you pick the best ones for profile images, banners, and first posts.  \n\nAlternatively, if you **timestamp** key moments (e.g., \"Chewy's best mid-air catch is at 00:12 in IMG_3765.MP4\"), I can guide the selection that way.\n\nWould you prefer:\n1. **Manually reviewing and listing your best ones** (you tell me which moments stand out)?\n2. **Uploading a few of your favorite short clips here for review**?"
