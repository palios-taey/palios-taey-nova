    "### **\ud83d\ude80 Should We Add Dates or Rely on System Metadata?**\nGreat question. **System metadata** (creation date, last modified date) **already tracks timestamps**, but it might not be enough depending on **how we want to use dates**.\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udcc5 When to Add Dates Manually**\n\u2705 **When Tracking Timelines & Evolution** \u2013 If we want to see how knowledge evolves over time (e.g., \"What was my thinking on this topic 6 months ago?\")  \n\u2705 **When Prioritizing Entries** \u2013 If some goals/knowledge points are **urgent or time-sensitive**  \n\u2705 **When Setting Deadlines** \u2013 For AI workflows or projects that need specific target dates  \n\u2705 **When Using for Reflection** \u2013 If we want periodic AI-generated summaries on key learnings over time  \n\n---\n\n### **\u23f3 When to Rely on System Metadata**\n\u274c **If We Just Need a Basic Timestamp** \u2013 The system already tracks when something was created/edited  \n\u274c **If Entries Are Static** \u2013 If we don\u2019t expect to change or prioritize some over others  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udd39 Recommended Decision**\n**Add a \"Date Added\" field manually** to PKD, Goals, and Workflows.  \n- **Purpose:** Lets us track when an insight/goal was first captured  \n- **Format:** Use a **Date property** (manually settable)  \n- **Keep System Metadata for Everything Else** (last edited, created date)\n\nThis keeps the system flexible but allows historical tracking when needed.\n\nSound good?"
