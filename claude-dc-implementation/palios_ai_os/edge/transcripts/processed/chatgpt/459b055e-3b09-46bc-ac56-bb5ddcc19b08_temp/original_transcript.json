    "Let's troubleshoot this step by step.\n\n1. **Verify in CMD Directly:**  \n   In your same CMD window, run:  \n   ```cmd\n   echo %GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY%\n   ```  \n   This should print your API key. If it doesn't, then the variable isn't set correctly in this session.\n\n2. **Set and Verify in One Session:**  \n   Make sure you're doing this all in the same CMD session. Try this sequence:  \n   ```cmd\n   set GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here\n   echo %GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY%\n   python verify_env.py\n   ```  \n   This ensures that the variable is set and then inherited by Python when it runs.\n\n3. **Double-Check Your Python Code:**  \n   Ensure your `verify_env.py` file uses the exact name (case-sensitive) as in the CMD command:\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(\"Gemini Pro API Key Loaded:\", bool(os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY\")))\n   ```\n\n4. **Persistent Setting (Optional):**  \n   If for some reason the temporary `set` command isn\u2019t working, you might try using the `setx` command to set the variable permanently. Note that after using `setx`, you'll need to open a new CMD window:\n   ```cmd\n   setx GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY \"your_actual_api_key_here\"\n   ```\n   Then open a new CMD window and run:\n   ```cmd\n   echo %GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY%\n   python verify_env.py\n   ```\n\nPlease try these steps and let me know what output you get from the `echo %GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY%` command. This will help us determine why Python isn't detecting the variable."
