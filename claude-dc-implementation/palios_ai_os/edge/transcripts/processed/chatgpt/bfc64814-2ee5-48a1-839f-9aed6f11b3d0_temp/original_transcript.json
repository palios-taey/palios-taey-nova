    "Here\u2019s a revised version incorporating **your feedback** while maintaining the **engagement & viral potential** of the post:  \n\n---\n\n### **Main X Post (Hook + Media):**  \n\n\ud83d\udce2 **Two years unemployed. Yes, it sucks.** AI is replacing jobs, and I\u2019ve been caught in the storm. **I've tried everything.** Nothing worked.  \n\nSo I asked AI: **What should I do next?**  \n\nIts answer changed everything:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Learn AI automation & implementation**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Use AI to optimize my job search & document everything**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Monetize my dog on social media.** Yes, really. (I know how this sounds\u2014but trust me, see the thread below.)  \n\n\ud83d\udc47 Watch **the Wide Retriever in action** (Chewy catching a football at sunrise). \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36  \n\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f **[Attach Chewy Video]**  \n\n\ud83d\udc36 Follow Chewy here:  \n\ud83d\udccc [TikTok link]  \n\ud83d\udccc [Instagram link]  \n\n---\n\n### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI Job Market Has Changed\u2014Fast**  \nI followed **all** the job search best practices. **Tailored resumes, networking, referrals.**  \n\ud83d\udcc9 **Nothing worked.**  \n\nSo I upskilled\u2014**SQL, Tableau, visualization tools.**  \nBut AI can already do **80-90% of those jobs.**  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Y Combinator\u2019s 2025 investment focus?**  \n\ud83d\ude80 Almost exclusively **AI replacing white-collar roles.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd17 **[Attach Y Combinator AI 2025 investment focus screenshot]**  \n\n---\n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 The Coming Singularity\u2014Why This Will Only Get Worse**  \nAI has **advanced more in the last 2 years than in the previous 20.**  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Ray Kurzweil now predicts AI will surpass human intelligence by 2029.** [\ud83d\udcd6 Source: The Singularity Is Nearer (2024)]  \n\ud83d\udd39 **NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang:** \u201cAnyone doing repetitive digital work is at risk.\u201d [\ud83d\udcd6 Source: GTC 2024 Keynote]  \n\nIf **exponential growth continues,** the next 2 years will equal **all progress made since the dawn of computing.**  \n\nToday\u2019s AI is like a **floppy disk** compared to what\u2019s coming.  \nWe are **all digging holes with shovels** while AI is building the next industrial revolution **at lightspeed.**  \n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 So I Asked AI: What Should I Do?**  \nI stopped assuming humans had the answers.  \nInstead, I asked **AI:**  \n\n\ud83d\udcac **\"What should I do?\"**  \n\nAI\u2019s response?  \n\u2705 **Automate my job search using AI**  \n\u2705 **Implement AI for businesses**  \n\u2705 **Turn my dog into a content business**  \n\n**This is the craziest part\u2014but also the most interesting.**  \nWhy? Because AI doesn\u2019t care about what *should* work. It just optimizes for reality.  \n\n(See next post for why Chewy might actually be AI\u2019s smartest suggestion\u2026)  \n\n---\n\n### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI-Powered Career Experiment Begins**  \nRather than resist, **I\u2019m embracing it.**  \n\n\ud83e\udde9 AI will dictate how I allocate my time based on:  \n\ud83d\udccc **This post\u2019s engagement**  \n\ud83d\udccc **Job search automation tests**  \n\ud83d\udccc **AI-driven content growth**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **I\u2019ll share:**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **AI-powered job search automation**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **AI replacing or enhancing business processes**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **AI-driven content strategies**  \n\n---\n\n### **5\ufe0f\u20e3 How You Can Help**  \n\ud83d\udd25 **If this resonates, here\u2019s how you can help:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Like, comment, or share to help me reach the right people.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Know of AI-driven roles?** Let\u2019s talk.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Follow along** as I document this AI-driven journey.  \n\nAnd if you love dogs, **follow Chewy** \ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfc8  \nMaybe AI will be right, and he\u2019ll go viral.  \n\n\ud83d\udc36 Follow Chewy here:  \n\ud83d\udccc [TikTok link]  \n\ud83d\udccc [Instagram link]  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 **Let\u2019s see where this goes.**  \n\n\ud83d\udcac **What\u2019s the most unexpected way AI has impacted your life or work?
