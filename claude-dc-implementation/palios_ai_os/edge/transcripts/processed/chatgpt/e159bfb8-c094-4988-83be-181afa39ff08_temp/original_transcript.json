That was the last one on the high-value list.  \n\n### **Next Steps:**\n1. **Draft message for Phil Steele to reshare tomorrow** (since he already confirmed he\u2019s in).  \n2. **Go through the broader recruiter list & job search connections**\u2014this will likely be more templated, but we can still personalize it in smart ways.  \n3. **Plan LinkedIn groups strategy**\u2014where to post & what angle to take.  \n4. **Make sure all social links (X, TikTok, Insta) are in place for tomorrow's post.**  \n\nWhich one do you want to tackle first?"
