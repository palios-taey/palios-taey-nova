    "Great. Next up is **Ron Lewis**\u2014he\u2019s a high-level exec at Ball Corp, so let\u2019s keep it professional but personal. Given you haven\u2019t had recent interaction, we should acknowledge that but keep it direct.\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Catching Up & A Quick Favor  \n\nHey Ron,  \n\nHope you're doing well! It\u2019s been a while since we last connected, but I wanted to reach out because I\u2019m about to do something big (and a little uncomfortable).  \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for two years despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d to land a role\u2014and it's been brutal. AI is changing the job market faster than anyone is prepared for.  \n\nSo I\u2019m taking a different approach. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m dropping a post about my career transformation experiment using AI, and I\u2019d really appreciate your help.  \n\nIf you think it\u2019s interesting, a reshare, comment, or even just a like would help get it in front of the right people.  \n\nI\u2019ll DM you the link when it goes live\u2014hope you\u2019ll check it out.  \n\nAppreciate it, Ron. Thanks!  \n\n\u2014 Jesse  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want any tweaks before sending!"
