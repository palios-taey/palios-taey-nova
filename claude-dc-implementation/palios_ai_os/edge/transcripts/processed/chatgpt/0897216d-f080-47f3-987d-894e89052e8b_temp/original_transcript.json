    "Got it\u2014let\u2019s make it as easy as possible for her to reshare by drafting a quick post she can copy/paste with minimal effort. Here\u2019s a version that highlights your long-standing connection to Keith and frames the post in a way that encourages engagement:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 (Concise & High-Impact):**  \n\nI\u2019ve known **Jesse LaRose** for nearly 20 years\u2014he was one of Keith Krach\u2019s early mentees and has always been a sharp, forward-thinking leader.  \n\nAfter two years of struggling in this rapidly changing job market, he\u2019s taking a bold step\u2014**launching an AI-driven career transformation experiment** and publicly documenting the journey.  \n\nThis is a fascinating take on how AI is reshaping work, and I\u2019d love to see the Sigma Chi & Purdue network come together to support him.  \n\nCheck it out & share if you can! \ud83d\udc47  \n\n\ud83d\udd17 [Insert Link Here]  \n\n---\n\n**Option 2 (More Personal & Story-Driven):**  \n\nJesse LaRose has always been a big thinker. I first met him nearly 20 years ago when he was an undergrad at Purdue and one of Keith Krach\u2019s early mentees. Now, he\u2019s taking on his biggest challenge yet.  \n\nAfter two years of doing everything \u201cright\u201d in the job search with no results, he\u2019s flipping the script\u2014**leveraging AI to rethink work itself and launching a career transformation experiment.**  \n\nAI is changing the job market at an unprecedented pace, and Jesse\u2019s journey is a must-follow for anyone navigating this shift.  \n\nIf you\u2019re in my network and can help, please check it out and share!  \n\n\ud83d\udd17 [Insert Link Here]  \n\n---\n\n### Message to Daniela:  \n\nHey Daniela,  \n\nI really appreciate you taking a look at this.
