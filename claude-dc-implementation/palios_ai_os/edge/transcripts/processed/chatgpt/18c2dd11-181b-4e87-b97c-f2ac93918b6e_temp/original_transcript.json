    "From your `transcript-errors.txt` output, here are the main issues and how you can resolve them:\n\n### Current Errors:\n\n1. **`KeyError: 'data_id'`** in `edge_processor.py`:\n   - The script currently expects each JSON file to contain a key named `data_id`. However, your transcript files don't include this key. You'll need to add logic to either extract or generate a `data_id`.\n\n2. **`Unsupported JSON format`**:\n   - The current implementation doesn't handle the varying formats of JSON and `.txt` transcript files from different AIs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok). The script needs modification to support multiple formats seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Steps:\n\n### \u2705 Step 1: Update `batch_processor.py` to support all AI transcript formats:\n- Handle multiple folders inside the `/transcripts/` directory automatically, including `temp_json_chats`, `grok`, `gemini`, and `chatgpt`.\n- Automatically detect and support the format differences in the JSON structure for Claude and ChatGPT, as well as `.txt` files.\n\n### \u2705 Step 2: Resolve `KeyError: 'data_id'` in `edge_processor.py`:\n- Auto-generate a unique `data_id` (e.g., UUID) if not present in JSON.\n\n---\n\nHere's the updated `batch_processor.py` script incorporating these fixes clearly:"
