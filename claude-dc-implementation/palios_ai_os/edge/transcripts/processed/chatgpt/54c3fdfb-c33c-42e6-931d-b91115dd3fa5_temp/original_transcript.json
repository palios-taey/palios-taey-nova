    "Hey Alon, appreciate you sending this over! RagMetrics looks really interesting, especially for optimizing LLM performance and evaluation. Right now, I\u2019m focused on setting up a structured AI memory & RAG system as an interim step\u2014building AI-enhanced workflows that retain my background, skills, and strategic goals to automate decision-making and execution.\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m kicking it off by structuring AI memory storage and influence mapping\u2014training AI to think like me (and key mentors) in certain areas while utilizing its global knowledge as well so it can guide me more effectively.\n\nI had booked some time through the site, but I saw it was declined\u2014totally get it if things are packed right now. Would still love to run some things by you if you have time early next week after I\u2019ve got more progress to share.\n\nReally interested in your take on AI-powered automation for personal agents and workflow elimination. Let me know if you'd be open to a quick chat!"
