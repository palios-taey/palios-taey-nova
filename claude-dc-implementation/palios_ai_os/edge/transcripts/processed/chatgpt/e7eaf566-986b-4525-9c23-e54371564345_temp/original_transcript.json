    "Yes\u2014let's do it **the simplest way possible** to immediately solve your issue clearly:\n\nYou can use **HTTPS authentication** (username/password) instead of SSH. It's quick, easy, and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Here\u2019s exactly what you need to do clearly (switching to HTTPS):**\n\n### Step 1: Set your git remote explicitly to HTTPS:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/projects/palios-taey-nova\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\n(This explicitly tells git to use HTTPS login rather than SSH keys.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Push your commits clearly again:\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n- Git will clearly prompt you for your GitHub **username** and a **Personal Access Token**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea9 **Important:**  \n- GitHub no longer allows your regular password. Instead, you need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.\n\n**If you don\u2019t already have a Personal Access Token:**\n\n- Go here explicitly: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)\n- Click clearly on **\"Generate new token\" \u2192 \"Generate new token (classic)\"**\n- Select clearly **repo** permissions explicitly.\n- Generate it and clearly copy the token.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Now when you push again, paste exactly:**\n\n- **Username:** your GitHub username (`palios-taey`)\n- **Password:** your newly generated **Personal Access Token**.\n\nThis clearly works immediately with no manual typing of keys.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **Bottom line clearly summarized:**  \n- Switching clearly to HTTPS is faster and simpler.\n- No manual typing or formatting issues\u2014just straightforward copy/paste credentials.\n\n**Do this right now**, and you'll have zero problems going forward!"
