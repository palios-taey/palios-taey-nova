    "Alright man, I havent been listening to you and now my wife is saying same thing that I need to ask my family and friends and I haven't done that yet. What is a plan for max effort to make something go viral this weekend on the chewy front? If that means personally calling people to get them to like him and follow then I'll do it at least 8 hours a day from now until sunday. which is hard because I have familiy coming in so can't do as much. So 32 hours of work to get this going. You can recommend whatever you think is best and I'll consider it."
