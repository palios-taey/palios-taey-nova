    "The issue you're facing is because **`git-filter-repo`** is installed locally in `~/.local/bin`, which is not included in your system's `$PATH`. To explicitly fix this, follow these quick steps:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Explicit Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Add local Python bin to PATH explicitly:**\n\nRun this command in Claude DC's terminal:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin\n```\n\n*(This ensures your terminal recognizes the new command.)*\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Re-run the commands explicitly:**\n\n```bash\ngit filter-repo --invert-paths --path scripts/setup.sh\ngit push --force origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 Permanent PATH Fix (Optional but recommended):\n\nAdd the path permanently so you don't have to redo this each session. Edit your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:\n\n```bash\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n---\n\nThis explicitly fixes your issue immediately and permanently."
