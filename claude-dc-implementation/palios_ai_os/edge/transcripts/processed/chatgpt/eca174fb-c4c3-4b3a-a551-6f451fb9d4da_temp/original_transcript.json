    "Yeah, when people comment *\"Send me this post\"*, it can mean a few different things:  \n\n1. **They want to share it easily** \u2013 They might be planning to repost it on their Story or send it to someone else and want you to DM it for convenience.  \n2. **They're engaging for visibility** \u2013 Some accounts, especially brand or pet-related pages, do this to try and get a DM conversation going, which can help with algorithm engagement.  \n3. **They might want to feature it** \u2013 Some pages repost viral pet content and want you to send it directly so they can easily grab it.  \n\nFor safety, I\u2019d DM them saying:  \n*\"Hey! Here\u2019s the post you asked for! Appreciate the love! \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udd25 Let me know if you\u2019re looking to share or feature Chewy somewhere!\"*  \n\nThat way, you clarify their intent while keeping the engagement going.  \n\nLet me know what they respond with!"
