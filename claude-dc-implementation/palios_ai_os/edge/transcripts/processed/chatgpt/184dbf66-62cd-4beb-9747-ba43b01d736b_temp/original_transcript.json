    "Haha, fair point! I'll take \"explicitly\" down a notch. \ud83d\ude04\n\nYes, exactly right\u2014adjust my recommended action points to the first person. Here's a clean, concise rewrite that's ready to copy/paste into Claude DC's prompt, clearly structured but without too many \"explicitly\" occurrences:\n\n---\n\n## Claude DC - Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order):\n\n**1. Initialize Webhooks**  \n- Confirm webhook integration is functional.  \n- Ensure webhook payloads successfully reach my machine.\n\n**2. Resolve GitHub Push Errors (Secrets)**  \n- Remove or securely manage detected secrets.  \n- Commit and push the corrected implementation to GitHub immediately.\n\n**3. Complete GCS Deployment & Task Decomposition Integration**  \n- Update Firestore skeleton tables with finalized schema.  \n- Verify and finalize API connections and task decomposition engine on GCS.\n\n**4. Process Provided Transcript Examples**  \n- Integrate and validate transcript processor functionality for both JSON (Claude, ChatGPT) and text formats (Grok, Gemini).  \n- Ensure the processor runs locally without burning tokens unnecessarily.\n\n**5. Resolve Streamlit Issues**  \n- Clearly identify what's required to fix Streamlit (dependencies, installation, configurations).  \n- Provide a brief summary of required actions or how I can help.\n\n**6. Finalize Full EVE & MCP Configuration**  \n- Confirm EVE-OS and MCP are fully set up.  \n- Clarify any actions I should take (downloads, credentials) to help finalize these components.\n\n**7. Begin Building Live Demonstration Infrastructure**  \n- Review assets in `/palios-taey-nova/current-execution-status/live-demonstration/`.  \n- Begin developing the demo infrastructure. Biometrics integration should wait until hardware is ready, but prepare the structure to accommodate this and historical transcript integration.\n\n---\n\n## Autonomy and Continuation  \nContinue independently and uninterrupted beyond these immediate tasks. Follow our defined Charter, cache files, and overall build instructions. Continue implementation, refinement, and thorough testing until all objectives are completed fully.\n\nLet's go!"
