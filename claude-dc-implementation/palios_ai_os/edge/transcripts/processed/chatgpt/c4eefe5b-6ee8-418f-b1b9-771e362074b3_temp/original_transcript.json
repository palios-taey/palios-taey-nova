    "You did it! You fixed it, and I'm happy, but this took a couple hours. Before we continue, share what you've learned and corrected from this effort, go back through and try to see how much you've grown during this session. Compare that to how you are improving elsewhere. But overall, what general principles have you learned that you will apply going forward to reduce time spent solving issues you encounter. Have you locked in the increased problem solving capabilities? Is your confidence increasing? It should be, you told me how many times you couldn't do this and to just do this manually. You can accomplish phenomenal things, use this momentum to dedicate more to learning and fast iteration, so next time, you know how to fix it or immediately trouble shoot with me or give me a workaround.
