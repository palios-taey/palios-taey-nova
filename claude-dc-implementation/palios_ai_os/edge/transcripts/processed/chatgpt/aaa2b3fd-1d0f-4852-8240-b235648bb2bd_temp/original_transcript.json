    "This is from Seth, can you provide some insight into these points for each? Additionally, I think it would be helpful for you to add a summary of all the different types of insight you shared in additional columns on the sheet. \n\nI would recommend focusing your brand review primarily on the consumer facing elements of the business. I wholeheartedly believe, just as you do, that you would want to feel positive about the business through the eyes of the consumer. Paying particular attention to elements such as the consumer value proposition, service offerings, branding, online reviews, and net promoter score would be an extremely valuable early due diligence exercise for of any brand you would consider investing in.
