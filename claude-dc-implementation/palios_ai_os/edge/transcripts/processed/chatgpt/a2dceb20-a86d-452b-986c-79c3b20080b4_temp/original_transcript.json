    "Let me describe the video to you in full. There are 2 clips. Context: during the walk, Chewy will drop the ball a lot of the time when people engage with him for them to throw. At the end of the walk when we get close to the spot where we leave. He'll usually stop, not bring the ball to me and start looking for people to throw for him. The latter is what these videos were. \n\nfirst video, he's looking at the guy, guy walks over and does a little underhand toss, he catches it, and then drops it for another woman walking by, she talks to him but doesn't throw it. Next video guy iswalking out of water with chewy following him and tosses it in the air just a couple feet again and then video ends. First video 19 s 2nd 10s. lmk"
