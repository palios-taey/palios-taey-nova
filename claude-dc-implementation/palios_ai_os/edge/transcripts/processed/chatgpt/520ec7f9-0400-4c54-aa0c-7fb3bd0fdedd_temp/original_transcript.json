    "You're correct; let me clarify exactly what's happening and what the next steps are.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc What's Actually Happening\n\nThe command you ran:\n\n```\ngit filter-repo --invert-paths --path scripts/setup.sh --force\n```\n\ncleaned up your local repository **by rewriting the entire commit history** to remove references to secrets. **However,** it also removed your GitHub remote URL (`origin`) from the repository configuration. That's why the NOTICE appeared:\n\n```\nNOTICE: Removing 'origin' remote\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Why the Push Didn't Work\n\nBecause `git filter-repo` removed the `origin` remote, your local repository no longer knows where to push. **Additionally**, the commit histories diverged, because GitHub still has the original (uncleaned) commit history. GitHub rejected your previous push attempt because the remote still contains the secrets you tried to remove.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)\n\n**Step 1: Reset the `origin` remote**\n\nRun:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n```\n\n(This restores the GitHub remote reference.)\n\n> **NOTE:**  \n> Ensure the URL above is exactly your repository URL.\n\n**Step 2: Force push your cleaned history**\n\nBecause you rewrote history, you **must force-push** this cleaned history:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin main --force\n```\n\nThis command explicitly overwrites the existing commit history on GitHub with your cleaned local history.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f What this Means for your Repo\n\n- \u2705 Your secrets **will no longer exist** in the remote repository.\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Anyone else who previously cloned the repo **must do a fresh clone**.\n- \u2705 You won't lose any local work if your local copy is complete and accurate (you've already cleaned and verified it).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Proceed Carefully:\n\nDouble-check these points first:\n\n- **Verify** you're on the right branch (`main`).\n- **Confirm** your local files are correct (secrets removed but nothing else lost).\n- **Re-add** your remote before pushing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Exactly what you should do next:\n\n```bash\n# Re-add remote origin:\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:palios-taey/palios-taey-nova.git\n\n# Force push cleaned commit history:\ngit push origin main --force\n```\n\nAfter these commands run successfully, your issue will be resolved fully.\n\n---\n\nGive that a try carefully, and let me know if anything doesn't look right!"
