    "What do you think? I'm not sure about the singularity, but I guess that's how AI people talk right?\n\nI do think that putting so much weight in Chewy in this makes me sound crazy. I think you described it as a low risk high potential reward that supports the overall goal of adapting to a world where white collar jobs are minimal and personal branding on social media is a viable path. In the likely case that it doesn't work, this is still a good thing to do because it forces learning a new, relevant skill in todays world, supports learning AI automation and just takes something I'm doing already, spending alone and family time with our dog and sharing those moments. That's why I went along with it. That is a lot, but I feel like if I don't clarify why this was cited as an option that people will think i've lost my mind (which maybe I have) for thinking my dog is going to go viral."
