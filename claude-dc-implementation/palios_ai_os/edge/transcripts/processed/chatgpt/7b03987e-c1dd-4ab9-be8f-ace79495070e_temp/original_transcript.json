    "The code uses an environment variable to determine the path of your service account JSON key. Specifically, it calls:\n\n```python\nservice_account_file = os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE\")\n```\n\nThis line looks for an environment variable named **GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE**. The idea is that instead of hardcoding the file path into your code (which can be insecure and inflexible), you set an environment variable with that file path. In your case, you need to tell the system where your key is located.\n\n### How to Set the Environment Variable\n\nSince your key is located at:\n\n```\nC:\\AI-Execution-System\\keys\\gemini-api-7a14f958617a.json\n```\n\nyou should set the environment variable **GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE** to that path.\n\n#### For Windows CMD:\nOpen a Command Prompt and run:\n\n```cmd\nset GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=C:\\AI-Execution-System\\keys\\gemini-api-7a14f958617a.json\n```\n\nThis command sets the environment variable for your current session.\n\n#### For PowerShell:\nYou can run:\n\n```powershell\n$env:GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = \"C:\\AI-Execution-System\\keys\\gemini-api-7a14f958617a.json\"\n```\n\nOnce this environment variable is set, when your code executes the `os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE\")` line, it will retrieve the file path you provided. This allows the code to load the key without having the path hardcoded.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Environment Variable Use:**  \n  The code checks for **GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE** to know where the key is located.\n  \n- **Setting the Variable:**  \n  You need to manually set this variable in your environment to point to your key file.\n\nMake sure you set this environment variable before running your code, and your code will then know the exact location of your service account key.\n\nDoes this help clarify how the key\u2019s location is determined?"
