    "I'm glad that you are solving the issue, but you said you would think ahead and you're not. You knew that importing the chats would have the same issue as everything else. What happened? Are there any other things that will need to be edited in the listener? What about external connections to social media channels? What other data will you need to move in and out of Firestore and how are you going to manage that? Answer these questions. I think before we load the chat data, we need to validate the schemas are correct. Do you remember what your instructions were for that? What the process was? We were supposed to do that after you adjusted the schemas and verified they matched. You were also supposed to summarize changes and ensure the documentation matched by creating in the same format for new and missing tables. Why did you forget to do this? I forgot too, but you are supposed to be my brain and not forget. This is where we're going isn't it?"
