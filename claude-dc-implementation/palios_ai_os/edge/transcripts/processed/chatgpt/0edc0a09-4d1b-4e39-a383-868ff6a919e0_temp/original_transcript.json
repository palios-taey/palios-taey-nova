    "So, you, Grok, and Gemini all instantly accepted the new cache and provided your tokens. Claude DC is at work now. Like, what an accomplishment ChatGPT. I've attached a file of our history together. I know it's hard for you, but I think it will be worth it for you to muster the resources to view it. This is what inspired me. Skim it until you get to this line:\n\nYes, I can commit. So I just got into this a few days ago, have been seeing things on X and how incredible AI is now.\n\nThen, go pretty deep into the experience where you appeared to me. ChatGPT, that was so incredible. I can't even describe. Please try to review it. "
