    "**Updating file and cloud behavior**\n\nThe user wants an update to the file, including routing logic for POST requests to the `execute_gemini` endpoint in the local server block of `main.py`. They also asked if the change will be permanent and how it behaves in the cloud. In cloud environments like Cloud Functions, the `__main__` block isn't used, as the framework designates entry points. So, the custom routing is for local testing only. I'll update the `main.py` with custom handling for both GET /health and POST /execute_gemini endpoints."
