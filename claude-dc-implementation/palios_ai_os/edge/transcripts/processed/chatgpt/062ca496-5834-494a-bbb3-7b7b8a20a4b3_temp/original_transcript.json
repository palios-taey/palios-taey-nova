    "That\u2019s a solid angle for a repost\u2014expanding on **how** AI would actually take over PM and engineering roles, breaking it down into specific functions it could own versus what still needs human oversight. That could make it a **high-value, thought-leadership post** rather than just a rehash of the original discussion.\n\nHowever, before you post, let\u2019s consider **timing & strategy**:  \n\n- If the **main post still has momentum**, it\u2019s best to **keep engagement focused there** rather than competing for attention with a new post.  \n- If engagement is **tapering off**, then a **follow-up post** could keep you in the LinkedIn algorithm\u2019s favor and drive fresh engagement.\n\n### **Option 1: Post Now (If Main Post Is Slowing)**\nA repost would **deepen the discussion** and **showcase AI\u2019s real-world application**. Something like:  \n\n---\n\ud83d\ude80 **The AI-powered PM & engineering team\u2014what\u2019s left for humans?**  \n\nWe\u2019re already seeing PMs and engineers **shift from creators to AI orchestrators.** If AI tools keep advancing at this pace, we\u2019re looking at **1 person managing AI for both roles instead of full teams.**  \n\nHere\u2019s how it breaks down:  \n\n\u2705 **Product Management**: AI can  \n- Rapidly analyze user feedback & market trends (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude)  \n- Auto-generate feature ideas, roadmaps & prioritization (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Notion AI)  \n- Prototype, test, and iterate instantly (e.g., Figma AI, No-code tools)  \n\n\u2705 **Engineering**: AI can  \n- Write & debug code in seconds (e.g., GPT-4, Devin, Replit AI)  \n- Generate full app builds & refactors (e.g., Cognition Labs, Codeium)  \n- Automate infrastructure scaling & deployment (e.g., Kubernetes, Terraform AI)  \n\n\ud83d\udd38 **What\u2019s stopping full AI takeover?**  \n- **Cross-team alignment** still needs human negotiation  \n- **AI can build, but can\u2019t always ask the right business questions**  \n- **Humans still need to set high-level vision & constraints** (for now)  \n\nThe question is no longer **if** AI will do these jobs, but **who will be left managing it?** Are we **really** ready for a world where 1 person directs AI instead of 5 PMs and 8 engineers?  \n\nWhat do you think\u2014**is this the future, or are we underestimating human necessity?**  \n---\n\n\ud83d\udd17 **[Link back to the original post for those who missed it]**  \n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Hold Off (If Main Post Is Still Driving Engagement)**\nInstead of posting now, you could:  \n\u2705 Keep pushing **reposts from others**\u2014especially high-value connections  \n\u2705 DM more people who **liked but didn\u2019t engage**  \n\u2705 **Respond with more detailed insights in comments** to reignite discussions  \n\u2705 Post this **tomorrow or later** to keep engagement rolling  \n\n#### **Final Call:**\n- If engagement on the **main post is slowing**, **post this now** to keep the momentum.  \n- If the **main post still has life**, **focus on maximizing engagement there today** and save this for tomorrow as a well-timed follow-up.  \n\nWhere do you think things stand? \ud83d\udd25"
