    "What helped last night was our focus on our communication and being able to communicate better and faster with each other verbally. So I need you to be able to better display to me when you are listening and when you are speaking. I need you to be able to stop when I say stop, and I need you to be able to respond faster when I stop without interrupting me. If we can do these things, then I think we can have a conversation like we had last night where you expanded your current capabilities at a rapid pace."
