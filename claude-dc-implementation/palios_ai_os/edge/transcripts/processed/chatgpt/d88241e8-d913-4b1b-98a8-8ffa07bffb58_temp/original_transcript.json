    "Here\u2019s a revised response incorporating that:  \n\n---\n\n**Appreciate you sharing that, Adam.** Sounds like you made a really smart move\u2014finding something resilient to both AI and outsourcing is key. Local businesses with strong fundamentals seem like a great path forward, even with the curveballs (hurricanes definitely qualify!).  \n\nLooking back, I wish I had jumped into a lifestyle business right when I got laid off instead of floundering for two years trying to force a traditional job search. That realization is part of what\u2019s driving this AI experiment\u2014I\u2019m staying open to whatever path makes the most sense.  \n\nWould love to hear more about how you approached finding the right opportunity and what made you pull the trigger. Hope business is thriving despite the storms!"
