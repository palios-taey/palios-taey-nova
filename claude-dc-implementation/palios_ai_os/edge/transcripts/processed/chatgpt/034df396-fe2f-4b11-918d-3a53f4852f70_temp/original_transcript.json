    "For Sam Greene\u2019s comment, I\u2019d keep the response light but firm to defuse any skepticism while reinforcing your approach. Something like:\n\n**\"Appreciate the perspective, Sam! The reality is AI is already transforming how people navigate work, and I\u2019m documenting it in real time. X has been a huge hub for AI conversations, so it makes sense to engage there too. But open to hearing why you see it as a red flag\u2014curious on your take!\"**\n\nThis keeps it professional, acknowledges the skepticism, and invites engagement without being defensive. Let me know if you want to tweak the tone!"
