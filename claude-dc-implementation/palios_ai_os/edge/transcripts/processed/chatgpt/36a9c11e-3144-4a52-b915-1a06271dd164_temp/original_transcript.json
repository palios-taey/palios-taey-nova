    "**Correcting credentials import**\n\nThe error is saying that the module 'google.oauth2.id_token' doesn't have 'IDTokenCredentials'. This suggests the issue is with how we're trying to use it. I remember that the 'google-auth' library has 'google.oauth2.service_account.IDTokenCredentials'. I'll check the official docs to confirm. Yep, it should be from the 'service_account' module! So, I'll update the code to import 'service_account' and use the correct method:\n\n```\ncredentials = service_account.IDTokenCredentials.from_service_account_file(\n            service_account_file, target_audience=TARGET_AUDIENCE\n        )\n```"
