    "Here\u2019s a more tailored cover letter focusing on the key skills you highlighted for the **Director, Business Strategy & Operations** role at True Classic:\n\n---\n\n**Cover Letter:**\n\nDear [Hiring Manager's Name],\n\nI am excited to apply for the Director of Business Strategy and Operations role at True Classic. With over a decade of experience leading cross-functional teams, driving operational efficiency, and implementing strategic initiatives, I am confident that my skill set aligns with the needs of your business.\n\nAt **Mirakl**, I spearheaded a major strategic initiative where I collaborated across sales, product, and operations teams to transform the company\u2019s drop-ship model. This initiative, a $100M business plan, involved defining strategic priorities with executive leadership, documenting processes for operational efficiency, and implementing scalable changes across the organization. I managed the onboarding of new partners and SaaS vendors, providing training and documentation to ensure seamless execution. This effort streamlined operations, increased process transparency, and drove revenue growth across the company.\n\nIn a **hyper-competitive environment at OJCommerce**, I led similar change management efforts focused on process design, automation, and documentation. I drafted hundreds of pages of new operational guidelines and KPIs that were vital in scaling the business from $30M to $100M in just three years. These processes helped foster cross-departmental collaboration, improved communication, and empowered teams to deliver measurable results. I also built and delivered training programs for both domestic and international teams, ensuring high adoption of new processes across all functions.\n\nWhat excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to further enhance True Classic\u2019s operational efficiency and help scale the business across multiple channels. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments and am driven by a desire to continuously improve processes and deliver business results. True Classic\u2019s values of moving fast and executing as a pro deeply resonate with me, and I am eager to contribute to your continued success.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with strategic planning, operational efficiency, and leadership can support True Classic\u2019s mission to drive growth and empower your team.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.\n\nBest regards,  \nJesse LaRose  \n[Your LinkedIn profile]  \n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nThis version highlights your leadership experience, change management, process documentation, and operational efficiency efforts. It uses specific examples from Mirakl and OJCommerce to demonstrate your cross-functional impact and strategic planning abilities, aligning with the requirements of the job."
