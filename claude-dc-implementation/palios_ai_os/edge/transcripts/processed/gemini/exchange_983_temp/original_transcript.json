    "User: I can't find it so did a new install, I am now configuring. Can you walk me through it? Welcome to the Google Cloud CLI! Run \"gcloud -h\" to get the list of available commands. --- Welcome! This command will take you through the configuration of gcloud. Settings from your current configuration [default] are: accessibility:   screen_reader: 'False' compute:   region: us-central1 core:   account: jesselarose@gmail.com   disable_usage_reporting: 'True'   project: ai-execution-system Pick configuration to use:  [1] Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings  [2] Create a new configuration Please enter your numeric choice:\n\nGemini: **Why choose option [1]?**\n\n*   **Simpler and Faster:** Re-initializing the default configuration is the quickest way to set up `gcloud` for your existing Google account and GCP project, which is likely what you want for this deployment.\n*   **Uses Existing Settings as a Base:** It will re-use your current settings as a starting point (account: jesselarose@gmail.com, project: ai-execution-system, region: us-central1), which are probably already correct.\n\n**Here's a step-by-step walkthrough after you choose [1]:**\n\n1.  **Enter `1` and press ENTER.**\n\n    The prompt will then likely proceed to the next step, which is to **select your Google account.**\n\n2.  **Account Selection Prompt:**  You will probably see a prompt like this:\n\n    ```\n    You are logged in as account [jesselarose@gmail.com].\n    Pick an account to use:\n     [1] jesselarose@gmail.com\n     [2] Create a new account\n    Please enter your numeric choice:\n    ```\n\n    *   **Choose option [1] to use your existing account: `jesselarose@gmail.com`.**\n    *   **Enter `1` and press ENTER.**\n\n    Using your existing `jesselarose@gmail.com` account is the correct choice because this is the account already associated with your GCP project `ai-execution-system`, as shown in the initial configuration summary.\n\n3.  **GCP Project Selection Prompt:** You might see a prompt to confirm or select your GCP project. It might look something like this:\n\n    ```\n    Your current Google Cloud Platform project is [ai-execution-system].\n    Do you want to change it? (Y/n)?\n    ```\n\n    *   **Answer `n` for NO.** You want to keep using your current project `ai-execution-system`.\n    *   **Type `n` and press ENTER.**\n\n    Keeping the project as `ai-execution-system` is essential because your Terraform deployment is designed to deploy resources within this specific GCP project.\n\n4.  **Default Compute Region and Zone (Optional Prompt):**  You *might* be prompted to set a default compute region and zone.  If you are prompted with something like this:\n\n    ```\n    What is your default Google Cloud Platform region?  [us-central1]:\n    ```\n\n    *   **Accept the default region `us-central1` by just pressing ENTER.**  `us-central1` is a common and generally good default region.  You can change this later if needed, but for MVP, `us-central1` is perfectly fine.\n    *   **If it asks for a default zone as well, you can also accept the default zone it suggests within `us-central1` or choose a zone within `us-central1` that is convenient for you.**  Zones are within regions (e.g., `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `us-central1-c` are zones within the `us-central1` region). For MVP, the specific zone is usually not critical.\n\n5.  **Confirmation and Completion:** After going through these prompts, the `gcloud` configuration should be complete. You should see a confirmation message like:\n\n    ```\n    Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!\n\n    * Account: jesselarose@gmail.com\n    * Project: ai-execution-system\n\n    ... (some more information might be displayed) ...\n    ```\n\n**After completing the `gcloud` configuration walkthrough:**\n\n*   **VERIFY `gcloud` Installation AGAIN:** Open a **NEW command prompt or Git Bash terminal** and run: `gcloud --version`\n    *   Ensure it now shows the `gcloud` version information **without any errors.**  This is crucial.\n\n*   **RE-RUN `bash deploy.sh` in Git Bash:**  Once `gcloud --version` is working correctly, go back to Git Bash, navigate to your Terraform directory, and run: `bash deploy.sh`\n\n**By following these steps to configure `gcloud`, and then re-running `bash deploy.sh`, you should now be able to get past the `gcloud` prerequisite check and proceed with the deployment process!**\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you get stuck at any point during the `gcloud` configuration!  We are very close to deployment! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
