    "User: It's installing on cmd\n\nGemini: Here's what you should do NOW, to continue this positive momentum:\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTION: Wait for Installation to COMPLETE and then try RENAME in cmd.exe:\n\nWAIT for the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command to COMPLETELY FINISH in cmd.exe. Let the installation process run until it is fully done. You will likely see messages indicating the progress and then a \"Successfully installed component...\" message when it's finished. Do not interrupt the installation.\n\nOnce the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command has finished SUCCESSFULLY in cmd.exe (and you see a success message):\n\nIn the SAME administrator cmd.exe window, IMMEDIATELY try running the RENAME COMMAND again:\n\ngcloud run services rename ai-execution-system-core --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --destination-service ai-execution-system\nRun this rename command in the administrator cmd.exe window right after the component installation finishes.\n\nWhat is the OUTPUT of the gcloud run services rename command in cmd.exe?\n\nDoes it WORK this time and rename your Cloud Run service successfully? You should see messages indicating that the service is being renamed and then a \"Service [ai-execution-system-core] is being renamed...\" message and finally a \"Service [ai-execution-system] now has traffic routed to it.\" message if it's successful.\nOr do you still get an error message? If you get an error, please copy and paste the entire error message here.\nIt's very important to wait for the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command to finish completely in cmd.exe and show a success message before you try running the rename command.\n\nPlease let me know the output of BOTH commands (gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy and then gcloud run services rename) when you run them in cmd.exe as administrator!\n\nIf the rename command works in cmd.exe, we will have finally resolved the naming issue and made significant progress! Let's see if it works! Keep me updated! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
