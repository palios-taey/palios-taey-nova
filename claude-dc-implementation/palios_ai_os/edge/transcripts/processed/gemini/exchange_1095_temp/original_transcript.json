    "User: C:\\ai-execution-system>git filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform 'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n\nGemini: This error now strongly suggests that while pip install git-filter-repo likely succeeded in installing the tool as a Python package, the executable for git-filter-repo is not in a directory that's currently in your system's PATH.\n\nLet's verify a couple of things to pinpoint this:\n\nVerify git-filter-repo.exe Location:\n\nPlease go to the C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts directory using File Explorer.\n\nDo you see a file named git-filter-repo.exe inside the C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts directory?\n\nIt should be there if pip install git-filter-repo was successful. Please confirm if you can find git-filter-repo.exe in that Scripts directory.\n\nDouble-Check System Path Variable (Again):\n\nYou've added C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts to your System Path, which is correct. But let's just double-check to be absolutely sure it's still there and spelled correctly.\n\nOpen the System Environment Variables window again (Windows key -> \"environment variables\" -> \"Edit the system environment variables\" -> \"Environment Variables...\").\nIn the \"System variables\" section, select the Path variable and click \"Edit...\".\nConfirm that C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts is still listed as one of the entries in your System Path variable and that it is spelled correctly.\nIs C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts definitely in your System Path list right now?\n\nAfter you confirm these two points, let me know your findings, and we'll figure out why git filter-repo command is still not being recognized. We are really close to the finish line now!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
