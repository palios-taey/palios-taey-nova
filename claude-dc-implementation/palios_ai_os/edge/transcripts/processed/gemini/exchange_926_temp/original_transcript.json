    "User: Can you walk me through the process for updating the github? We just completed revamped our file storage structure.\n\nGemini: Step-by-Step Guide to Update GitHub Repository:\n\n[STEP 1] Verify Your Local ai-system-backend-v2 Codebase:\n\nAction: Carefully browse your local C:\\AI-Execution-System directory (or wherever your ai-system-backend-v2 code is located).\nCheck: Ensure that this local directory contains the ABSOLUTELY LATEST version of your ai-system-backend-v2 codebase, including all the files and the revamped file structure you want to upload to GitHub. Double-check you are in the correct directory and that it represents the codebase you intend to deploy.\n[STEP 2] Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:\n\nAction: Open your terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).\nNavigate: Use the cd command to navigate into the ROOT directory of your local ai-system-backend-v2 codebase. For example, if your ai-system-backend-v2 code is directly within C:\\AI-Execution-System, you would type:\ncd C:\\AI-Execution-System\nIf your ai-system-backend-v2 code is in a subdirectory within C:\\AI-Execution-System (e.g., C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai-system-backend-v2), navigate to that subdirectory instead:\ncd C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai-system-backend-v2\nVerify Location: Once you've navigated, use the pwd (macOS/Linux) or cd (Windows) command to confirm that your terminal is currently in the root directory of your ai-system-backend-v2 codebase. You should see the directory path in your terminal prompt.\n[STEP 3] Check Git Repository Status:\n\nAction: In your terminal, type the following command and press Enter:\ngit status\nInterpret Output:\nIf it says \"fatal: not a git repository\": This means your local ai-system-backend-v2 directory is NOT yet initialized as a Git repository. Proceed to Step 4A (Initialize as Git Repo).\nIf it shows a list of \"Changes not staged for commit\" or \"Untracked files\": This means your directory IS a Git repository, and Git is tracking changes. Proceed to Step 4B (Stage, Commit, Push).\n4A. [STEP 4A - If NOT a Git Repo] Initialize Local Git Repository: * Action: If git status in Step 3 indicated it's not a Git repository, run the following command to initialize it: bash git init * Confirmation: You should see output like \"Initialized empty Git repository...\"\n\n4B. [STEP 4B - If ALREADY a Git Repo] Stage, Commit, and Push Changes: * [Sub-step 4B.1] Stage All Changes: To stage all the updated and new files in your codebase (including your revamped file structure), run: bash git add . (The . means \"stage all changes in the current directory and subdirectories\") * [Sub-step 4B.2] Commit Changes: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message about the update. For example: bash git commit -m \"Update codebase with latest ai-system-backend-v2 and revamped file structure\" (Replace the message in quotes with a more specific description if needed) * [Sub-step 4B.3] Connect to Remote Repository (if needed): If you haven't already linked your local repo to your remote GitHub repository, you need to add the \"remote origin\". Run this command, replacing <your_github_repository_url> with your actual repository URL (https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system-core.git): bash git remote add origin <your_github_repository_url> For example: bash git remote add origin https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system-core.git (If you've already connected to the remote repository, this step is usually not needed. You can check existing remotes with git remote -v) * [Sub-step 4B.4] Push to GitHub: Finally, push your local commits to the main branch (or whichever branch you want to update on GitHub) using: bash git push origin main You might be asked to authenticate with your GitHub credentials (username/password or a personal access token) during the push.\n\n[STEP 5] Verify Update on GitHub Website:\nAction: Open your web browser and go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system-core.git\nCheck: VERIFY that the files and directories in your GitHub repository now reflect the LATEST VERSION of your ai-system-backend-v2 codebase, including your revamped file structure. Browse through the repository on the GitHub website to confirm everything is correctly uploaded and up-to-date.\nImportant Notes:\n\nBranch: By default, we are assuming you want to update the main branch of your repository. If you are using a different branch (e.g., develop), replace main in the git push origin main command with your branch name.\nAuthentication: Be prepared to enter your GitHub credentials if prompted during the git push step. You might need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password if you have 2-factor authentication enabled on GitHub.\nLarge Files: If you have very large files in your repository (unlikely for code, but possible for data files), you might encounter issues pushing them. For codebases, this is usually not a problem.\nError Messages: If you encounter any error messages during any of these steps, please copy and paste the full error message into our chat, and I can help you troubleshoot.\nLet me know if you have any questions at any step, or if you encounter any issues during the GitHub update process! Once you have successfully updated the GitHub repository with your latest codebase, we can proceed with sending the revised deployment request to Claude.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
