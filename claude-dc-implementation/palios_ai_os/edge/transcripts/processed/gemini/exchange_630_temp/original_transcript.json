Let's try the single-line command first.\n\nPLEASE RUN THE SINGLE-LINE gcloud functions deploy COMMAND and REPORT BACK:\n\n\"SINGLE-LINE DEPLOY COMMAND RUNNING...\" (When you start the command).\nDoes it still give the \"unrecognized arguments\" error? (YES/NO).\nIf it runs without \"unrecognized arguments\" error, report progress as it deploys!\nLet's see if the single-line command fixes the syntax issue in cmd.exe! GO! GO!
