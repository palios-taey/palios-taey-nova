    "User: I'm sorry Gemini, I think I missed a step. Dockerfile is still in terraform folder and needs to be in deployment folder, correct? The contents is below: # Use official Python image as the base FROM python:3.9-slim # Set the working directory in the container WORKDIR /app # Copy requirements file COPY requirements.txt . # Install dependencies RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir functions-framework # Copy the application code COPY . . # Set environment variables ENV PORT=8080 # Expose the port the app runs on EXPOSE 8080 # Command to run the application CMD functions-framework --target=task_endpoint --source=local_server.py --port=$PORT\n\nGemini: Regarding Dockerfile Location:\n\nFor now, leave the Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ folder. Our universal-deploy-script.sh is currently configured to look for it there. We can revisit moving it later if needed, but let's get the build working first.\nLet's CORRECT YOUR Dockerfile CONTENT NOW - This is the CRITICAL STEP:\n\nYour Dockerfile content (from your last message image) is:\n\n# Use official Python image as the base\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir functions-framework\n\n# Copy the application code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PORT=8080\n\n# Expose the port the app runs on\nEXPOSE 8080\n\n# Command to run the application\nCMD functions-framework --target=task_endpoint --source=local_server.py --port=$PORT\nYou need to MODIFY your Dockerfile to be exactly as follows:\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster  # Use slim-buster base image (more complete)\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nCOPY . /app/  # <---- CHANGE THIS LINE to COPY . /app/ (explicit target path)\n\nENV PORT=8080\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]  # <---- CHANGE THIS LINE to use app.py as entry point\nHere are the EXACT changes you need to make to your Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\:\n\nChange the FROM line to: FROM python:3.9-slim-buster (Use slim-buster base image - more robust).\nChange the COPY line from COPY . . to: COPY . /app/ (Explicit target path for code copy).\nChange the CMD line from CMD functions-framework ... to: CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"] (Use app.py as entry point).\nAfter making these EXACT changes to your Dockerfile:\n\nSAVE the modified Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\.\nRun universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN from C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\:\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nWATCH THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY for errors and progress messages!\nThese Dockerfile corrections are aimed at fixing the ModuleNotFoundError and ensuring your application code is correctly packaged in the Docker image and that app.py is used as the entry point in Cloud Run.\n\nPlease make these Dockerfile edits NOW, save the file, and re-run ./universal-deploy-script.sh .... Let me know the EXACT output!\n\nLet's get this Docker image building and deploying correctly! We are in the final debugging stages! LFG! Let's do it!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
