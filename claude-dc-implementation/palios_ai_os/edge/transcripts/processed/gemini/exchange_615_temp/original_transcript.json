    "User: YES, I FOUND A RECENT COLLABORATIVE TASK DOCUMENT!\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_b28c18.png\n\nGemini: 1. CONFIRM type: collaborative: You already said \"YES\", but just double-check that the type field is indeed set to 'collaborative' (with quotes).\n\n2. INSPECT the subtasks ARRAY:\n\n*   **SCROLL DOWN** in the collaborative task document in Firestore until you find the field named  `subtasks`.\n*   **CLICK on the *ARROW or TRIANGLE*** next to the `subtasks` field to **EXPAND** the `subtasks` ARRAY.  This will show you the list of subtask objects *inside* the array.\n*   **LOOK at the *NUMBER OF ITEMS* in the `subtasks` array.**  Is it more than just one or two?  (e.g., Is it around 5, 10, or more subtasks listed there?)\n*   **OPEN UP (EXPAND) *ONE or TWO* of the *INDIVIDUAL SUBTASK OBJECTS*** inside the `subtasks` array.  To expand a subtask object, click the *ARROW or TRIANGLE* next to a subtask's index number (like `0:`, `1:`, etc.).\n*   **FOR EACH *EXPANDED SUBTASK OBJECT*, VERIFY that you see these FIELDS:**\n    *   `subtask_id`  (a unique ID for the subtask)\n    *   `objective`  (describing what this subtask is supposed to do - e.g., \"Generate ideas for robot character\")\n    *   `assigned_model` (e.g.,  `\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\"`)\n    *   `status` (likely  `\"completed\"`, `\"pending\"`, or `\"running\"`)\n    *   `capabilities` (an array of capabilities)\n    *   `output_format` (e.g., `\"text\"`)\n    *   `result`  (might be `null` or contain some text - don't worry about the content of `result` *yet*, just check if the field exists)\nPLEASE REPORT BACK ONCE YOU HAVE INSPECTED THE subtasks ARRAY in your RECENT COLLABORATIVE TASK DOCUMENT!\n\nTell me:\n\nConfirm again: \"YES, it's a COLLABORATIVE TASK DOCUMENT!\"\nThe DOCUMENT ID of this collaborative task (again, just to be sure we're talking about the same one).\n\"YES, I see the type: collaborative field.\"\n\"YES, I see the subtasks ARRAY.\"\n\"The subtasks ARRAY contains approximately [NUMBER] subtasks.\" (e.g., \"approximately 10 subtasks\")\n\"YES, each subtask object I checked has fields like subtask_id, objective, assigned_model, status, etc.\"\nOnce we confirm the subtasks array structure in Firestore, we'll move on to check the RESULTS COLLECTION for the corresponding result document! ALMOST THERE! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
