Specifying google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0 in requirements.txt should have fixed this by forcing a newer version to be installed during deployment. However, the error persists. This means either:\n\nrequirements.txt is not being processed correctly during deployment (less likely, but possible).\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0 is being installed, but the version still doesn't have TextGenerationModel (unlikely, as 1.27.0 and later should have it).\nThere's some other issue preventing the correct library version from being used in the Cloud Function's runtime environment.\nInvestigating requirements.txt and Deployment:\n\nDouble-checked location: Confirmed requirements.txt is in the same directory as main.py. User seems organized, so this is less likely but still worth mentally verifying.\nCloud Build Logs (Crucial Step): The key to understanding what's happening during deployment is the Cloud Build logs. The gcloud functions deploy output provides a URL to these logs. This is the most important troubleshooting step now. We need to examine the logs to see:\nIf requirements.txt is being processed.\nIf pip install -r requirements.txt is being executed.\nIf google-cloud-aiplatform is being installed.\nIf there are any errors during the dependency installation process.\nWhat version of google-cloud-aiplatform is actually getting installed (if any).\nConsidering Alternative Solutions/Workarounds (If requirements.txt is the problem):\n\nIf the Cloud Build Logs show issues with requirements.txt processing or google-cloud-aiplatform installation, we might need to try alternative ways to ensure the dependency is available. (e.g., pip install google-cloud-aiplatform inside main.py - not ideal for Cloud Functions, but for extreme debugging).\nFocusing on Cloud Build Logs (Priority): Before trying complex workarounds, the most direct and informative step is to carefully examine the Cloud Build Logs. This will give us concrete evidence of what's going wrong during the deployment process regarding dependencies.\n\nPre-computation/Analysis for generating the response:\n\nAssume the user will check Cloud Build logs and provide relevant information or confirm successful installation/no errors.\nIf logs are not helpful or show no obvious errors, proceed with assuming there might be a versioning or environment issue.\nPrepare to suggest checking the exact google-cloud-aiplatform version in the deployed Cloud Function runtime (if possible - might require more code in main.py to print library versions, but let's start with logs).\nIf logs are still unclear, consider the \"new function name\" approach to force a clean environment as a next debugging step.\nGenerating the response (leading to the user checking logs):\n\nThe response should guide the user to check the Cloud Build Logs as the primary next action. It should explain why logs are important and what to look for. It should also offer the \"new function name\" approach as a secondary debugging tactic if logs don't reveal the issue. The response should maintain a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing problem-solving and progress.\n\nThis thought process leads directly to the suggested actions in the prompt: check requirements.txt, check Cloud Build Logs, try deploying to a new function name, and then test again. The priority is on the logs because they are the most direct source of information about the deployment process.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
