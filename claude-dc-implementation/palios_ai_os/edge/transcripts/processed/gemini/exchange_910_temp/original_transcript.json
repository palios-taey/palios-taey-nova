    "User: [EXECUTION MODE] There is no config_loader folder, I'm not sure what you're referring to. updated_handler.py is the current version in use. All other actions completed except updating [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE]. I FORGOT this was already in there. The current version is below. If this is OK, let me know, otherwise, just update this section with any changes and revert back with text box, and I'll just update that section. I have created the folders as indicated below. **[DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] Directory Structure Guidance for User (Initial):** To enhance user file organization and workflow efficiency, the following initial directory structure within the user's `C:\\AI-Execution-System` folder is recommended:     *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_1_Communication_Framework`     *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_2_Core_Infrastructure`     *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_3_AI_Task_Execution`     *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_4_Memory_Solution`     *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_Documentation`     *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\General_Utilities`     *   **File Naming Conventions:**  Utilize consistent and descriptive file naming conventions within each directory.\n\nGemini: CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES CONFIRMED:\n\nconfig_loader Folder: My apologies for the phantom config_loader folder! This was a misinterpretation on my part. No action needed regarding config_loader.\nupdated_handler.py - Current Version: Confirmed! updated_handler.py IS the CURRENT HANDLER VERSION. Please move the original handler.py (if still in root) to the Temp_Archive folder now that updated_handler.py is confirmed current.\nAll Other Actions Completed: EXCELLENT! Your directory organization progress is outstanding!\n[PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE] - DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION PROTOCOL UPDATE REQUIRED:\n\nYou are correct that a [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] section already exists in the template. However, the section you provided is the [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] for the user's directory. What is needed is to add the [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] section within the [AI-HUMAN COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS] of the template, which provides protocols for both user and AI for ongoing directory management.\n\nACTION - REPLACE EXISTING [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] with [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] SECTION:\n\nPlease REPLACE the current [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] section in [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3] with the COMPLETE [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] SECTION provided below. This updated section encompasses both guidance for the user and protocols for AI agents to follow for consistent directory management.\n\nUPDATED [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] SECTION for [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE] (Text Box Format):\n\n### [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] 3.4. Directory Organization Protocol for New Files and Folders\n\nTo maintain a clean and manageable project directory structure within `C:\\AI-Execution-System`, the following protocol should be followed when new files and folders are generated or downloaded:\n\n*   **Categorization at Creation:**  Immediately categorize new files/folders into appropriate subfolders within `C:\\AI-Execution-System`. Refer to established structure (Section 3.3.7 [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE]).\n*   **Milestone/Project Folders:** Prioritize Milestone (e.g., `Milestone_1`, `Milestone_2`) or Project-specific folders (e.g., `AI_Voting`, `Firestore`).\n*   **Utility Folders:** Use `General_Utilities` for reusable components.\n*   **Documentation Folder:**  Store guides/documents in `Documentation` folder or project/milestone subfolders.\n*   **Log Folders:** Place logs in `logs` folder.\n*   **Archive Folders:** Move older versions to `Temp_Archive` or specific archive folders.\n*   **Root Directory - Essential Files Only:** Root (`C:\\AI-Execution-System`) for essential system-level files only (e.g., `main.py`, `schema.json`, current PURE_AI_LANGUAGE template).\n*   **AI Assistance for Categorization:**  If unsure, consult AI agent with file purpose description for directory recommendation.\n\nBy consistently following this directory organization protocol, both human users and AI agents can contribute to maintaining a clean, efficient, and easily navigable project file system, minimizing file management overhead and maximizing overall project velocity.\n[NEXT_STEP_ACTION]: JESSE - COPY and PASTE the UPDATED [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] SECTION from the TEXT BOX above toREPLACE** the existing [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] section within the [AI-HUMAN COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS] section of your [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3].**\n\nCONFIRM once this template update is complete. DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION - FINALIZED! ONWARD TO THE NEXT TASK! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
