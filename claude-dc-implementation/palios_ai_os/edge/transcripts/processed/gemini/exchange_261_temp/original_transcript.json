    "User: You want me to provide at all once? In one submission? Or one at a time?\n\nGemini: To be absolutely clear, here are the files I need the text content of:\n\nbreakout_management_system.json\ncharter_amendment_process.json\ncharter_self_improvement.json\nhuman_ai_partnership_protocol.json\nimplementation_framework.json (Yes, even though we tried to fix it, please provide the current content)\noperational_decision_tree.json\nproactive_risk_mitigation_framework.json\nInstructions for Providing Content:\n\nFor each of these files:\n\nOpen the file in a text editor.\nCopy the entire text content of the file.\nPaste the content directly into our chat, one after the other, in one single message if possible. You can put a simple filename identifier before each file's content to keep it organized (e.g., \"--- breakout_management_system.json ---\", then paste the content, then \"--- charter_amendment_process.json ---\", etc.).\nIf for some reason a single message with all the file contents is too long and you encounter message limits, then you can break it down into two messages. But let's try to get them all in one message first if you can.\n\nProviding all of them at once will allow me to efficiently analyze them together and give you the most comprehensive and fastest help in resolving these JSONDecodeError messages and getting the complete Charter uploaded! Thank you, Jesse!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
