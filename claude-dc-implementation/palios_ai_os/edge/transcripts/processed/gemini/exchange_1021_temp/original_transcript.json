    "User: No, this is the EXACT content of the Dockerfile, copied/pasted. I did not submit a screenshot. FROM python:3.9-slim-buster  # Use slim-buster base image (more complete) WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install -r requirements.txt COPY . /app/  # <---- CHANGE THIS LINE to COPY . /app/ (explicit target path) ENV PORT=8080 EXPOSE 8080 CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]  # <---- CHANGE THIS LINE to use app.py as entry point\n\nGemini: Incorrect file encoding: Dockerfile needs to be plain text (UTF-8 or ASCII). If it's somehow saved with a different encoding (e.g., UTF-16), Docker might misinterpret it.\nHidden characters: Copying and pasting from certain sources can sometimes introduce invisible control characters that are not visible in a text editor but can confuse Docker.\nLine endings: While less common on Windows with Git Bash, incorrect line endings (e.g., if the file was created on a different OS and line endings were not converted) could theoretically cause parsing issues, though less likely for the FROM line.\nTherefore, the most robust next step is to ask the user to manually RE-CREATE the Dockerfile file using Windows Notepad, typing it in character by character, as described in the SPECIAL INSTRUCTION. This is the most foolproof way to ensure a clean, correctly encoded, and syntactically perfect Dockerfile and eliminate potential hidden issues from copy/pasting or incorrect file saving methods.\n\nBy using Notepad and manually typing, we ensure a plain text file with standard encoding and line endings. This methodical re-creation is the best way to definitively rule out Dockerfile syntax problems as the cause of the persistent \"dockerfile parse error\".\n\nIf after this meticulous re-creation and re-running universal-deploy-script.sh, the \"dockerfile parse error\" still persists, then we would need to consider even more fundamental environment issues or potentially an extremely subtle and unusual Docker bug, but let's exhaust the possibility of a simple Dockerfile problem first with this careful re-creation process.\n\nTherefore, the SPECIAL INSTRUCTION is to guide the user through the meticulous Notepad re-creation process, step-by-step, and then have them re-run the deployment script and report the output. This targeted approach is the most logical next step given the persistent nature of the \"dockerfile parse error\".\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
