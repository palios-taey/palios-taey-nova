    "User: Yes, let's go forward! I want to test this and keep moving!\n\nGemini: Let's get the /task endpoint working NOW!\n\nHere are the IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS to implement and test the /task endpoint in your minimal Flask app:\n\nMODIFY your app.py file in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ to include the /task endpoint. Use the following code snippet as a starting point. Copy and paste this code into your app.py, replacing the existing content of app.py:\n\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])  # Keep the Hello World route for now\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World from Flask!'\n\n@app.route('/task', methods=['POST'])  #  Basic /task endpoint\ndef task_endpoint():\n    task_data = request.get_json()  # Get JSON data from the request\n    print(\"Task data received:\", task_data) # Log the received task data (for debugging - you can remove this later if needed)\n    return jsonify({\"message\": \"Task received!\"}), 200 # Return a JSON response\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False)\nEXACT CHANGES in app.py (compared to the minimal \"Hello, World\" app):\n\nAdded a new @app.route('/task', methods=['POST']) route and the task_endpoint() function.\nThis task_endpoint() function:\nRetrieves JSON data sent in the POST request using request.get_json().\nPrints the received task_data to the console (for debugging - you can remove this later).\nReturns a JSON response {\"message\": \"Task received!\"} with an HTTP status code 200 (OK).\nSAVE the modified app.py file in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\.\n\nDEPLOY your updated app.py to Cloud Run using universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nRun this command in your MINGW64 terminal from the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\ directory.\n\nWait for the deployment to complete. You will see the deployment logs in the terminal, and eventually a \"Deployment complete!\" message and the Service URL.\n\nTEST the /task endpoint using curl from your MINGW64 terminal:\n\nCOPY the \"Service URL\" that universal-deploy-script.sh prints out after deployment (it will be for ai-execution-system-core).\n\nConstruct a curl command to send a POST request to the /task endpoint of your deployed service, including a simple JSON payload. Replace YOUR_SERVICE_URL with the actual Service URL you copied:\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task\": \"This is a test task\"}' YOUR_SERVICE_URL/task\nExample (replace YOUR_SERVICE_URL with your actual URL):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task\": \"This is a test task\"}' https://ai-execution-system-core-abcdefg-uc.a.run.app/task\nRun this curl command in your MINGW64 terminal.\n\nVERIFY the RESPONSE from the /task endpoint in your MINGW64 terminal.\n\nYou should see a JSON response like this in your terminal output:\n\n{\"message\": \"Task received!\"}\nIf you see this JSON response, it means your /task endpoint is WORKING CORRECTLY! \ud83e\udd73\n\nLet's get the /task endpoint implemented, deployed, and tested NOW!\n\nPlease modify your app.py, deploy using universal-deploy-script.sh, test with curl, and let me know the results!\n\nThis is the first step towards building out the core API functionality of your AI Execution System! LFG! We are making real progress now!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
