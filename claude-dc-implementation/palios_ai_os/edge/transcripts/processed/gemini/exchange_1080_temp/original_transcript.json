Git is no longer tracking those files in the staging area.\n\nLet's confirm and proceed with the push:\n\nRun git status one more time:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git status\nWhat does git status say now? Ideally, it should tell you something like \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\" or it might show .gitignore as being changed (if you added and committed it just now). It should not list any files in deployment/terraform/.terraform.\n\nLet me know the output of git status.\n\nIf git status looks clean (or only shows .gitignore), try the git push command again:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git push\nHopefully, this time, the git push will be successful because the large files should no longer be in your Git repository or staging area.\n\nLet's see the output of git status and then try the push again. We are getting closer!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
