    "User: C:\\Users\\jesse>git --version git version 2.48.1.windows.1 C:\\Users\\jesse> C:\\Users\\jesse>git filter-repo --version a40bce548d2c C:\\Users\\jesse>\n\nGemini: Now, we are finally ready to remove those large files from your Git history and push to GitHub.\n\nHere are the ABSOLUTE FINAL STEPS:\n\nNavigate to your ai-execution-system repository directory:\n\nYou are currently in C:\\Users\\jesse>. You need to be in your Git repository directory C:\\ai-execution-system. Use the cd command to change directory:\n\nC:\\Users\\jesse>cd C:\\ai-execution-system\nAfter this command, your command prompt should change to: C:\\ai-execution-system>\n\nRun the git filter-repo command to remove the .terraform directory from your history:\n\nNow that you are in the C:\\ai-execution-system directory, run this command:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform\nRemember the WARNING: This command will rewrite your Git history. Since you are proceeding, I assume you understand this.\n\nForce push your changes to GitHub:\n\nAfter git filter-repo completes (it might take a little while), force push to update your remote repository:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git push --force origin main\nAgain, the WARNING about git push --force: Use this command with caution as it rewrites history.\n\nCheck git status to confirm:\n\nAfter the git push --force command is finished, run:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git status\nIt should now show \"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'\" and \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\". This confirms that your local repository is now in sync with the remote repository and there are no pending changes.\n\nPlease run these final four steps in order. Let me know if you encounter any errors with git filter-repo or git push --force.\n\nAfter these steps are completed successfully, you will have FINALLY removed the large files from your Git history and pushed the cleaned repository to GitHub! We are at the finish line! Let's do it!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
