    "User: ERROR: (gcloud.run.deploy) Revision 'ai-execution-system-core-00006-ddw' is not ready and cannot serve traffic. The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable within the allocated timeout. This can happen when the container port is misconfigured or if the timeout is too short. The health check timeout can be extended. Logs for this revision might contain more information. Logs URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?project=ai-execution-system&resource=cloud_run_revision/service_name/ai-execution-system-core/revision_name/ai-execution-system-core-00006-ddw&advancedFilter=resource.type%3D%22cloud_run_revision%22%0Aresource.labels.service_name%3D%22ai-execution-system-core%22%0Aresource.labels.revision_name%3D%22ai-execution-system-core-00006-ddw%22 For more troubleshooting guidance, see https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/troubleshooting#container-failed-to-start Deployment complete! Service URL: Health endpoint: /health Task endpoint: /task \u2713 Deployment script execution completed.\n\nGemini: Please do the following CAREFULLY to get the detailed pip install output from your Cloud Build logs:\n\nGo back to the CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL from your latest deployment attempt (the one that just failed with the flask error). You can find this URL in the output of your universal-deploy-script.sh command.\n\nOpen the CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL in your web browser.\n\nFind the \"build\" step again in the Cloud Build logs (it's the step where the Docker image is built).\n\nCLICK on the \"build\" step to expand its logs.\n\nSCROLL DOWN within the expanded \"build\" step logs. You need to find the entire output of this command:\n\nRUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt\nThe output will be below that line and will show the progress of pip install, downloading and installing packages.\n\nCAREFULLY EXAMINE the ENTIRE OUTPUT of the pip install -r /app/requirements.txt command. Look for ANY lines that say \"ERROR\" or \"WARNING\". Even if the build step itself is marked as \"SUCCESS\", there might be errors or warnings within the pip install output itself.\n\nCOPY and PASTE the ENTIRE pip install -r /app/requirements.txt OUTPUT from the Cloud Build logs HERE. It's very important to copy all the output of this command, including any errors, warnings, and progress messages.\n\nWe need to see the detailed pip install output to understand why Flask is not being installed. Please provide the full output of the RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt step from your Cloud Build logs.\n\nOnce we have this detailed pip install log, we will be able to pinpoint the reason why flask is missing and get your application working! Let's get those detailed logs! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
