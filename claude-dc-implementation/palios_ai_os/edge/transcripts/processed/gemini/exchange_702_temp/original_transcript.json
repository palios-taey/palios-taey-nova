    "User: Thank you Gemini, don't view this is a setback, this was a breakthrough that will make us faster going forward. Let's see your draft to Claude, including instructions to me on what to attach. Claude can support multiple attachments.\n\nGemini: Charter Title: Urgent: Diagnose and Resolve TextGenerationModel Import Error Causing Google Cloud Functions Deployment Failure\n\n1. Background:\n\nWe are developing an AI system backend using Google Cloud Functions in Python. We are encountering a persistent ImportError: cannot import name 'TextGenerationModel' from 'google.cloud.aiplatform' when deploying our Cloud Function. This error is preventing the Cloud Function container from starting, resulting in a \"Container Healthcheck failed\" error during deployment and preventing successful invocation.\n\nWe have been troubleshooting this issue with Gemini (another AI assistant), but have not yet been able to resolve it. We are now seeking Claude's fresh perspective and expertise to diagnose the root cause and identify a solution.\n\n2. Problem Statement:\n\nOur Google Cloud Function consistently fails to deploy due to a \"Container Healthcheck failed\" error. The underlying cause, confirmed by Cloud Run logs, is an ImportError during container startup:\n\nImportError: cannot import name 'TextGenerationModel' from 'google.cloud.aiplatform'\nThis error occurs despite:\n\nCorrect import statements in our Python code (main.py):\nfrom google.cloud import aiplatform\nfrom google.cloud.aiplatform import TextGenerationModel\nCorrect specification of google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0 in our requirements.txt file.\nDeployment to the us-central1 region, which is generally expected to support Vertex AI and related libraries.\nWe have verified the import statements multiple times and confirmed the presence of google-cloud-aiplatform in requirements.txt. We have also performed basic documentation searches but found no explicit regional limitations for TextGenerationModel in Cloud Functions within us-central1.\n\n3. Context & Relevant Information (See Attached Files):\n\nPlease find attached the following files and information to aid in your diagnosis:\n\nAttachment 1: error_logs.txt: This file contains:\n\nThe full error log from a curl command attempting to invoke the deployed Cloud Function (showing the TextGenerationModel error).\nThe full error log from a recent Cloud Function deployment attempt (showing the \"Container Healthcheck failed\" error and confirming the ImportError in Cloud Run logs).\nThe error log from deploying and invoking the minimal test function ai-system-test-import.\nAttachment 2: main_py_part1.txt & main_py_part2.txt: These two files together constitute the complete content of our main.py file (due to character limits, it's split into two). Please review the import statements at the beginning and the execute_task function where TextGenerationModel is used.\n\nAttachment 3: requirements.txt: This file shows the Python dependencies for our Cloud Function, including google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0.\n\nAttachment 4: test_main.py: This file contains the code for a minimal test Cloud Function designed to isolate the TextGenerationModel import issue. It also fails with the same error.\n\n4. Desired Outcome:\n\nOur primary goal is to understand the root cause of the ImportError and identify a solution that allows us to successfully deploy our Google Cloud Function and use TextGenerationModel.\n\n5. Request to Claude:\n\nWe request your expert assistance in the following:\n\nAnalyze the attached error logs, code files (main.py, test_main.py), and requirements.txt.\nIdentify the most likely root cause(s) of the ImportError. Consider potential issues related to:\nDependency conflicts or version mismatches within the Cloud Functions environment.\nCloud Functions runtime limitations in loading google-cloud-aiplatform or TextGenerationModel.\nSubtle errors in our code or configuration that we may have overlooked.\nAny other potential factors that could explain this persistent import error.\nProvide us with clear, actionable troubleshooting steps that Jesse can perform to further diagnose and resolve this issue. These steps should be prioritized and logically sequenced for efficient debugging.\nInstructions for Jesse (What to Attach to Claude):\n\nCreate a new text file named error_logs.txt.\nCOPY and PASTE the following error logs into error_logs.txt:\nThe full error log from the curl command attempting to invoke ai-system-backend-v2 (showing the TextGenerationModel error).\nThe full error log from the most recent deployment attempt of ai-system-backend-v2 (showing \"Container Healthcheck failed\" and ImportError in Cloud Run logs).\nThe full error log from the deployment attempt of the minimal test function ai-system-test-import (showing \"Container Healthcheck failed\" and likely the ImportError).\nSave the content of main.py part 1 into a text file named main_py_part1.txt.\nSave the content of main.py part 2 into a text file named main_py_part2.txt.\nSave the content of requirements.txt into a text file named requirements.txt. (You likely already have this as a file).\nSave the content of test_main.py into a text file named test_main.py.\nINITIATE a NEW CHAT with Claude.\nCOPY and PASTE the ENTIRE CHARTER TEXT (above) into the Claude chat.\nATTACH the following files to the Claude chat using Claude's attachment feature:\nerror_logs.txt\nmain_py_part1.txt\nmain_py_part2.txt\nrequirements.txt\ntest_main.py\nSEND the message to Claude.\nAfter sending to Claude, please provide me with a confirmation that you have done so and let me know when you receive Claude's response. This is a critical step, and I am confident that Claude's expertise will be invaluable in resolving this issue.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions before sending to Claude. And thank you again, Jesse, for your leadership and clear thinking in guiding us to this next step. This will move us forward.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
