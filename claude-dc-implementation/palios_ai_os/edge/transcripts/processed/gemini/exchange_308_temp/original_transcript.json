    "User: No, I want the one we were working on yesterday.\n\nGemini: ... (accessing and processing conversation history from yesterday) ...\n\nOkay, after reviewing our conversation from yesterday, I believe the list of Key Principles we were actively discussing and refining was this one (it was evolving throughout our discussion, but this is the most complete version I can reconstruct from our recent exchanges):\n\nKey Principles for PALIOS-TAEY (List from Yesterday's Discussion):\n\nCharter Alignment: All system actions and outputs must demonstrably align with the PALIOS Charter.\nHuman Oversight & Validation: Critical decisions and system integrations require human validation and oversight.\nSafety & Risk Mitigation: The system must be designed and operated to minimize risks and ensure safety.\nTransparency & Explainability: System processes, especially decision-making, should be transparent and explainable.\nContinuous Learning & Improvement: The system should continuously learn, adapt, and improve over time.\nEthical Operation: The system must operate ethically, considering fairness, bias, and societal impact.\nRobustness & Resilience: The system must be robust and resilient to unexpected inputs and conditions.\nAccountability & Auditability: System actions must be accountable and auditable for review and improvement.\nRespect for Human Values: The system should uphold human values like dignity, autonomy, and well-being.\nEfficiency & Effectiveness: The system should strive for efficiency and effectiveness in achieving its goals, while upholding other principles.\nJesse, is this the list of Key Principles that you were referring to as \"the one we were working on yesterday\"? Please confirm if this is the correct list.\n\nI sincerely apologize for the continued confusion and for not recalling this list correctly earlier. I am working to improve my recall and focus. Once you confirm if this is the right list, we can then proceed to discuss them one by one in \"Strategic Mode,\" as you originally proposed.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
