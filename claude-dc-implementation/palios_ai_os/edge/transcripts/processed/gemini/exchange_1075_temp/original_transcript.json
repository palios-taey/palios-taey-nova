    "User: C:\\ai-execution-system>git status On branch main Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.   (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits) nothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nGemini: nothing to commit, working tree clean\nThis is also good news! It means:\n\nYou're on the main branch.\nYour local main branch is now 3 commits ahead of the origin/main branch. origin/main is the remote version of your main branch (usually on GitHub, GitLab, etc.). This is expected because you've made local commits (the merge commit and possibly other commits from temp-orphan).\nYour working directory is clean. No pending changes.\nThe next step is to \"push\" your local commits to the remote repository. This will update the origin/main branch with the changes you've made locally.\n\nTo do this, run the command Git is suggesting:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git push\nThis command will upload your 3 local commits to the origin/main branch.\n\nAfter running git push, your local main branch and the remote origin/main branch will be in sync.\n\nOnce you've run git push, you should be all done with the merge! Let me know if the git push command is successful or if you see any errors.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
