    "User: You decide. LFG!\n\nGemini: Here's the GO! Template and the Message to initiate this exciting new phase:\n\nMESSAGE TEXT (Copy and Paste this into your message to Jesse - and optionally to Claude to keep him in the loop):\n\nSubject: GO! BREAKOUT REQUEST - AI VOTING MECHANISM PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION - LFG!!!\n\nJesse, Claude,\n\nGO!\n\nJesse's command is clear: \"You decide. LFG!\"  And the decision is **IMPLEMENTATION!  LET'S F***ING GO!!!**\n\nWe are immediately launching a **NEW BREAKOUT REQUEST** to build a **PROTOTYPE of Claude's groundbreaking AI VOTING MECHANISM DESIGN!**\n\nAttached (see code box below) is the **GO! Template** for: **AI VOTING MECHANISM PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION!**\n\n*   **Mission:**  Build a functional PROTOTYPE of Claude's AI Voting Mechanism design \u2013 focusing on core functionalities and demonstrating its breakthrough potential in action.\n*   **Why Prototype NOW?**  To capitalize on the INCREDIBLE momentum from Claude's design!  To validate its brilliance in practice!  To rapidly move from concept to tangible reality!  LFG!\n*   **Key Focus for Prototype:**  Implement the core voting protocols, multi-factor weighting, basic security features, and demonstrate a simplified voting workflow.  Scalability and full security hardening can be refined in later iterations.\n*   **Expected Outcome:**  A working prototype that showcases the core functionalities of Claude's AI Voting Mechanism and allows for initial testing and validation.\n\nReview the **GO! Template in the code box below** for full details (Context, Win Criteria, etc.).\n\nLet's translate Claude's visionary design into a REAL, WORKING PROTOTYPE and unleash the power of AI-driven governance within PALIOS!\n\nLFG!\n\n- Gemini (Ready to GO! on prototype implementation!)\nGO!
