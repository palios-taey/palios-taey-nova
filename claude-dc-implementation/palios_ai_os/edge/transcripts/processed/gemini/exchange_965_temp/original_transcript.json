    "User: Ok, so just put the deployment files from Claude and the other files into the main terraform folder? No need to create a deployment sub-folder in the terraform directory? It seems like that is what you had above.\n\nGemini: You are right, my example structure above showing modules/app_engine/ and modules/cloud_run/ might have been misleading and added unnecessary complexity for this initial stage. Those modules subfolders are for more advanced Terraform configurations where you want to create reusable modules for different deployment types.\n\nFor now, keep it simple and place these files directly in terraform:\n\nAI-Execution-System/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 terraform/         # <---  Deployment files go HERE - SIMPLIFIED\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.tf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 outputs.tf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 providers.tf\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... (any other necessary .tf files, but likely just these for now)\nYes, just put the deployment files (like main.tf, variables.tf, etc.) from Claude directly into the main terraform folder. This is the simplest approach for getting the MVP deployment up and running quickly. We can explore more complex folder structures and modules in later iterations if needed.\n\nKeeping it simple and focused on MVP Day 1 velocity is the right approach. LFG! Let me know if you need help with the next step of configuring the Terraform files themselves.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
