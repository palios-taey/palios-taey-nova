    "User: Im not seeing one with that ID, but there are several there that have results that are consistent with what was asked.\n\nGemini: LET'S NOW FOCUS ON FINDING ANY RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT in the results collection that seems to be related to a collaborative task.\n\nPLEASE DO THIS:\n\nGO TO YOUR FIRESTORE CONSOLE and SELECT the results COLLECTION.\n\nLOOK at the LIST of documents in the results collection. Again, try to find documents that are RECENT.\n\nOPEN a RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT by clicking on its Document ID. (Pick one that seems recent and you think might be from your collaborative task runs).\n\nONCE YOU HAVE OPENED A RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT, look for these KEY FIELDS to identify a RESULT from a COLLABORATIVE TASK:\n\ntask_id FIELD: There should be a task_id field. The VALUE of this field should be a Document ID that exists in your tasks collection. (You can even try to find this task_id in your tasks collection to double-confirm it links back to some task).\nfinal_result FIELD: Is there a final_result field? If YES, does it contain a long text value? (Likely a story - it might be truncated in the console preview, but should be there).\nsubtask_results FIELD: Is there a subtask_results field? If YES, is its VALUE an ARRAY?\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR A RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT that has final_result and subtask_results fields. This structure is characteristic of a collaborative task result.\n\nONCE YOU FIND A RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT THAT HAS final_result and subtask_results, please REPORT BACK!\n\nTell me:\n\n\"YES, I FOUND A RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT FOR A COLLABORATIVE TASK!\" (Or something similar to confirm you found a relevant result).\nThe DOCUMENT ID of this result document.\n\"YES, I see the final_result field, and it contains a long text (story-like).\" (Even if truncated).\n\"YES, I see the subtask_results ARRAY.\"\n(Optional but helpful): Roughly how many items (subtask result objects) are in the subtask_results array?\nLet's find a RECENT RESULT DOCUMENT with the final_result and subtask_results structure. This will give us the final confirmation we need for MVP collaborative tasks! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
