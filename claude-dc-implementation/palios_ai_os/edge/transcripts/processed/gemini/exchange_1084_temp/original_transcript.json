    "User: C:\\ai-execution-system>python --version Python 3.12.8 C:\\ai-execution-system>pip --version 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. C:\\ai-execution-system>\n\nGemini: python -m ensurepip\nand press Enter.\n\nExplanation:\n\npython : This runs your Python interpreter.\n-m ensurepip: This tells Python to run the ensurepip module as a script. ensurepip's job is to install pip if it's not already installed, or upgrade it to the latest version.\nAfter running python -m ensurepip, please try again to check pip's version:\n\npip --version\nTell me if pip --version now works and shows you the pip version information. If it works, we can then use pip to install git-filter-repo.\n\nIf python -m ensurepip doesn't work or if pip --version still fails after running it, let me know the output, and we'll explore other ways to get pip working.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
