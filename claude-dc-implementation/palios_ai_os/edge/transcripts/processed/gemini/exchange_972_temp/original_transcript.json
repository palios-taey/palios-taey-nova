    "User: and gemini key value starts with \\n, do I include that?\n\nGemini: Here's why and how to handle it:\n\nNewline Character in Key Representation: It's possible that when you obtained your Gemini API key (e.g., from a credentials file or cloud console), it was presented in a format that visually appears to start with a newline. This is sometimes done for formatting or readability, especially in files that might contain multiple lines of configuration. However, the actual key value itself should not start with a newline character.\n\nTerraform Variable Value is a String: In sensitive.auto.tfvars, you are defining the gemini_api_key as a string variable. String values in programming languages and configuration files (like Terraform) are meant to contain the actual text content, not leading or trailing whitespace characters like newlines, unless those newlines are intentionally part of the data itself (which is NOT the case for API keys).\n\nPotential for Authentication Errors: Including a leading newline character in your API key value would likely cause authentication errors when your application tries to use the key to access the Gemini API. The API expects the exact key string, without extra whitespace.\n\nHow to Correctly Copy and Paste Your Gemini API Key:\n\nLocate your Gemini API key value. Go to the source where you obtained your Gemini API key (e.g., Google Cloud Console, credentials file).\nCarefully copy the actual key value text. Select and copy the text characters that constitute the key itself. Do NOT include any leading or trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) that might be present around the key value in its original source.\nPaste the copied key value directly between the double quotes in your sensitive.auto.tfvars file.\nExample - Correct sensitive.auto.tfvars format (assuming your key looks like it starts with \\n in its source):\n\nLet's say when you look at your Gemini API key, it visually looks like this in the source (this is just an example, the actual format might vary):\n\nGemini API Key:\n\\nAIzaSyDfg...your-actual-key-value-here...xyz123\nIn this example, the \\n is just a representation of a newline character before the actual key. When you copy and paste into sensitive.auto.tfvars, you should ONLY copy and paste the characters starting from A in AIzaSyDfg... to the end, EXCLUDING the \\n and any other leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nCorrect sensitive.auto.tfvars Content:\n\nopenai_api_key = \"sk-your-openai-api-key-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\ngemini_api_key = \"AIzaSyDfg...your-actual-key-value-here...xyz123\"\nNotice in the example above:\n\nThere is NO newline character \\n at the beginning of the gemini_api_key value in sensitive.auto.tfvars.\nThe API key value starts immediately after the opening double quote \".\nThe API key value ends immediately before the closing double quote \".\nAction Plan:\n\nCarefully re-examine your Gemini API key source. Identify the actual key value text itself, excluding any formatting characters like leading/trailing whitespace or newlines that are not part of the key.\nUpdate sensitive.auto.tfvars: Open sensitive.auto.tfvars and replace the gemini_api_key value with the correctly copied key value, ensuring it is enclosed in double quotes and does NOT include a leading newline character.\nRun terraform plan again. After updating sensitive.auto.tfvars, run terraform plan in your terraform directory to see if Terraform configuration now works correctly with the API keys. Check for any errors related to authentication or API key format.\nLet me know if this clarifies how to handle the Gemini API key and the newline character. We are getting closer to deploying!
