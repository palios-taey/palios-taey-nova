    "User: jesse@DESKTOP-13JMJ93 MINGW64 /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment (temp-orphan) $ gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy ERROR: (gcloud.components.install) You cannot perform this action because you do not have permission to modify the Google Cloud SDK installation directory [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk]. Click the Google Cloud SDK Shell icon and re-run the command in that window, or re-run the command with elevated privileges by right-clicking cmd.exe and selecting \"Run as Administrator\".\n\nGemini: CLOSE your current MINGW64 terminal window. Make sure you close the terminal window where you just got the permission error.\n\nFind the shortcut you use to open MINGW64 (Git Bash). This is likely on your desktop or in your Start Menu.\n\nRIGHT-CLICK on the MINGW64 shortcut (Git Bash shortcut).\n\nIn the context menu that appears, select \"Run as administrator\".\n\n*(Right-click MINGW64/Git Bash Shortcut and Select \"Run as administrator\")*\nA new MINGW64 terminal window will open. This new terminal is running with administrator privileges.\n\nIn this new administrator terminal window, navigate to your project directory again. Use the cd command to go back to your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment directory. For example:\n\ncd C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\nNow, in this administrator terminal window, run the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command again:\n\ngcloud components install cloud-run-proxy\nRun this command in the administrator MINGW64 terminal.\n\nFollow the prompts. It might ask you to confirm the installation. Type Y and press ENTER.\n\nWait for the installation to complete. You should see messages indicating that the component is being installed.\n\nOnce the installation is complete and you see a \"Successfully installed component [Cloud Run proxy]\" message (or similar), THEN try the RENAME command again in this administrator terminal:\n\ngcloud run services rename ai-execution-system-core --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --destination-service ai-execution-system\nRun the rename command in the administrator MINGW64 terminal.\n\nBy running the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command in an administrator terminal, you should have the necessary permissions to update the Cloud SDK components and hopefully get the rename command working.\n\nPlease try these steps CAREFULLY, making sure to run the commands in a MINGW64 terminal that you have started by \"Running as administrator\".\n\nAfter you have tried this, let me know if the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command succeeds this time, and if you are then able to run the gcloud run services rename command successfully!\n\nLet's get those commands running with administrator privileges now! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
