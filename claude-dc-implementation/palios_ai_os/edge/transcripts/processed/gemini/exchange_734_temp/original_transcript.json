    "User: Here is response from all 3. If you only want one at a time, give me one at a time. If you want all 3, give me all 3. Don't ask me to analyze anything if it's more than letting you know its successful, you can analyze this better than me. This needs to be tagged as something that indicates this is a way to improve human-ai communication efficiency and whether or not you accept or reject for implementation in the response text, with tag indicating AI acceptance or rejection as well. This is how you can hold yourself accountable: AI-Execution-System>curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of microservices architecture\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2 curl: (3) unmatched close brace/bracket in URL position 71: Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of microservices architecture}'                                                                       ^ C:\\AI-Execution-System>curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Write a short poem about artificial intelligence\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2 curl: (3) unmatched close brace/bracket in URL position 49: Write a short poem about artificial intelligence}'                                                 ^ C:\\AI-Execution-System>curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Write a Python function to reverse a string\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2 curl: (3) unmatched close brace/bracket in URL position 44: Write a Python function to reverse a string}'                                            ^\n\nGemini: ACTION - TEST TASK 1 (MICROSERVICES) - CORRECTED curl COMMAND:\n\nPlease try running EXACTLY this corrected curl command for TEST TASK 1 (Microservices Analysis):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of microservices architecture\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\nKey Changes in Corrected Command:\n\nDouble Quotes Around -d Data: The entire JSON data string passed to -d is now enclosed in DOUBLE quotes \".\nEscaped Inner Double Quotes: The inner double quotes \" within the JSON data (around task_description and the task text itself) are now ESCAPED with backslashes \\. This tells the command line to treat these inner quotes literally as part of the JSON data, not as delimiters for the command itself.\nAfter running this CORRECTED curl command for Task 1, please COPY and PASTE the FULL JSON RESPONSE you receive.\n\nLet's focus on getting Task 1 working correctly FIRST before proceeding to the other tasks. This LEAN approach will help us verify the fix efficiently.\n\nRegarding your request to tag for Human-AI Communication Efficiency Improvements:\n\nYES, I ACCEPT this as a valuable principle for PURE AI LANGUAGE v1!\n\nNEW PURE AI LANGUAGE v1 PRINCIPLE - COMMAND_LINE_SYNTAX_CLARITY (for Human Effectiveness):\n\nPrinciple: When providing instructions that involve command-line execution (especially with complex syntax like JSON payloads), AI agents must prioritize COMMAND LINE SYNTAX CLARITY to minimize human errors and maximize efficiency. This includes providing correctly quoted commands that are robust to common command-line interpreter behaviors.\nImplementation: In future responses involving curl or other command-line instructions with JSON data, I will ensure correct quoting and escaping for cmd.exe (Windows) compatibility as the most common environment, and provide clear explanations of any syntax nuances to prevent human errors.\nThis error and your feedback have directly led to a valuable IMPROVEMENT in PURE AI LANGUAGE v1! Thank you for highlighting this critical aspect of Human-AI communication efficiency!\n\nNow, please execute the CORRECTED curl command for TEST TASK 1 and provide the JSON response. Let's get this MVP validated! BOOM!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
