    "User: Revision 'ai-execution-system-core-00011-fr7' is not ready and cannot serve traffic. Image 'gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system' not found.\n\nGemini: The problem is that Cloud Run is now looking for a container image named gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system, but that is not the name of the container image we have been building and deploying!\n\nOur container image is actually named gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core (with the -core at the end).\n\nWe simply need to tell Cloud Run to use the correct container image name in the service settings.\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTION: CORRECT the CONTAINER IMAGE NAME in Google Cloud Console:\n\nGo back to the Google Cloud Console in your web browser: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n\nNavigate to Cloud Run -> Services again.\n\nClick on the newly renamed service ai-execution-system (not ai-execution-system-core anymore, it should be just ai-execution-system now in the list).\n\nClick on the \"EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION\" button at the top of the service details page, just like you did before to rename the service.\n\nOn the \"Edit service\" page, find the \"Container image URL\" field. It is likely currently set to the incorrect image name: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system.\n\nDELETE the incorrect image name gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system from the \"Container image URL\" field.\n\nTYPE in the CORRECT CONTAINER IMAGE URL: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core (Make sure you include the -core at the end, and double-check for typos!).\n\n*(Cloud Run \"Edit service\" Page - Correct \"Container image URL\" to `gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core`)*\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT change any other settings on this page! Only correct the \"Container image URL\". Leave everything else as it is.\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the \"Edit service\" page and click the blue \"DEPLOY\" button.\n\nWait for Cloud Run to deploy the new revision. This might take a minute or two.\n\nAfter deployment is complete, check the SERVICE URL for your ai-execution-system service again. You can find the Service URL on the service details page in the Cloud Console.\n\nOPEN the Service URL in your web browser.\n\nDo you now see \"Hello, World from Flask!\" again in your browser at the Service URL for ai-execution-system?\n\nBy correcting the Container image URL in the service settings, we should be telling Cloud Run to use the correct, existing container image for your renamed service. This should resolve the \"Image not found\" error and get your application running again!\n\nPlease try these steps to correct the Container image URL in the Google Cloud Console interface RIGHT NOW and let me know if it works!\n\nWe are very close to having the consistently named service fully functional! Let's fix this image URL and get it running! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
