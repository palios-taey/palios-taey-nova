    "User: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform>go install 'go' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. I am in cmd. Trying to follow install instructions and got this message. Is that because I need to be in SDK?\n\nGemini: You are in the Terraform INSTALLATION directory, not your PROJECT directory: The C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform> directory you are in is likely the installation directory for the Terraform executable itself. Looking at the files in your image, it contains files like go.mod, go.sum, .go source files, etc. - these are files related to the Terraform program's codebase, which is written in Go.\n\ngo install is for installing GO PACKAGES/PROGRAMS, not deploying with Terraform: The command go install is a Go command used to compile and install Go programs or packages. You would use this command if you were developing or building the Terraform program itself from source code.\n\nYou already HAVE Terraform installed: You downloaded and installed Terraform. You don't need to reinstall or rebuild it from the source code in that directory. The Terraform installation process should have already placed the terraform executable in a location that is (or should be) in your system's PATH.\n\nYou need to use the terraform command to deploy, not go install: To deploy your ai-system-backend-v2 application to GCP using Terraform, you need to use the terraform command itself (the executable you installed). You need to run commands like:\n\nterraform init\nterraform plan\nterraform apply\nNOT go install.\n\nYou should be running Terraform commands in your DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION directory: You should be running the terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply commands in the directory where you placed your Terraform configuration files (the main.tf, variables.tf, providers.tf, etc. files). As we just clarified, this should be the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform\\ directory where you are currently located, but not to run go install, but to run the Terraform deployment commands.\n\nIn summary, you got the \"'go' is not recognized...\" error because you were in the Terraform installation directory and tried to run a Go command (go install) which is not the correct command for deploying with Terraform and is not meant to be run in that context.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nSTOP trying to run go install. You don't need it.\nVerify Terraform Installation: Open a new command prompt (just to be sure environment variables are freshly loaded) and simply type: terraform --version\nIf Terraform is correctly installed and in your PATH, this command should output the Terraform version. If you get \"'terraform' is not recognized...\", then there's an issue with your Terraform installation not being in your system's PATH. You might need to add the directory where you installed Terraform to your PATH environment variable.\nNavigate to your Terraform CONFIGURATION directory: Go to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform\\ (which you are already in based on your prompt).\nRun Terraform Deployment Commands: In that C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform\\ directory, run the Terraform deployment commands in this order:\nterraform init\nterraform plan\nterraform apply\nYou do NOT need the Go SDK to deploy with Terraform. You only need the Terraform executable itself, and you already have that installed.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues running terraform --version or terraform init in the correct terraform directory. We'll get this deployment going! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
