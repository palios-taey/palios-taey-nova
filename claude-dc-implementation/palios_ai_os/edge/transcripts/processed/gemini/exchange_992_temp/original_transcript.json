    "User: Ok, it looks like the API keys didn't work either. Should we address that too? Or should I just paste them in during setup?\n\nGemini: \u2577\n\u2502 Error: Unsupported argument\n\u2502\n\u2502    on main.tf line 33, in resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\":\n\u2502    33:         automatic = true\n\u2502\n\u2502 An argument named \"automatic\" is not expected here.\n\u2575\n\u2577\n\u2502 Error: Unsupported argument\n\u2502\n\u2502    on main.tf line 41, in resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\":\n\u2502    41:         automatic = true\n\u2502\n\u2502 An argument named \"automatic\" is not expected here.\n\u2575\nProblem: The error message clearly says \"An argument named 'automatic' is not expected here.\" This means that in your main.tf file, within the resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\" and resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\" blocks, you have lines that say automatic = true, but the google_secret_manager_secret resource in Terraform does NOT support an argument called automatic.\n\nSolution: REMOVE the lines automatic = true from main.tf\n\nYou need to edit your main.tf file and delete or comment out these two lines:\n\nautomatic = true (in the google_secret_manager_secret \"openai_api_key\" block, likely around line 33)\nautomatic = true (in the google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\" block, likely around line 41)\nHere's how to edit main.tf:\n\nOpen main.tf in a text editor. Navigate to your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform (or C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform) directory and open main.tf in a plain text editor (like Notepad++, VS Code, Notepad).\nFind lines 33 and 41 (or thereabouts). Look for the resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\" and resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\" blocks.\nDELETE or COMMENT OUT the line automatic = true in EACH of these blocks.\nTo DELETE: Simply remove the entire line automatic = true.\nTo COMMENT OUT: Add a # at the beginning of the line to make it a comment, like this: # automatic = true. Commenting out keeps the line in the file but tells Terraform to ignore it. Commenting is often safer in case you need to refer back to it later, but deleting is also fine in this case.\nSave the main.tf file.\nAfter editing main.tf to remove the automatic = true lines:\n\nRe-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash.\n\nObserve if the \"Unsupported argument\" errors during terraform plan are GONE. If you have correctly removed the lines, terraform plan should now proceed without these errors.\n\nIf terraform plan is successful this time (no \"Unsupported argument\" errors), then proceed with the deployment by typing yes when prompted by terraform apply.\n\nRegarding API Keys and sensitive.auto.tfvars:\n\nYes, sensitive.auto.tfvars should still work to provide your API keys. By fixing the main.tf configuration error, we are now addressing the configuration issue that was preventing Terraform from even planning correctly.\nYou can continue to SKIP entering API keys at the prompts in deploy.sh (just press ENTER twice). Terraform should load the keys from sensitive.auto.tfvars automatically.\nIf, after fixing main.tf and proceeding with terraform apply, you encounter any authentication errors related to API keys, THEN we can investigate if there's an issue with how sensitive.auto.tfvars is being loaded or if the key values themselves are incorrect. But let's address the \"Unsupported argument\" errors in main.tf first.\nAction for you NOW:\n\nEDIT main.tf and REMOVE or COMMENT OUT the automatic = true lines in the google_secret_manager_secret resources.\nSave main.tf.\nRe-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash.\nReport if the \"Unsupported argument\" errors are gone and if terraform plan is now successful.\nLet's get these Terraform configuration errors fixed and move forward with the deployment! LFG! You are doing fantastic work troubleshooting and persevering through these challenges!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
