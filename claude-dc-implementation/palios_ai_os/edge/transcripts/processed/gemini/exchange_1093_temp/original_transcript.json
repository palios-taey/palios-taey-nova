    "User: python.exe is present. Screenshot of paths. Do I need it in my variables as well?\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_bf13c7.png\n\nGemini: Here's exactly what you need to do:\n\nEdit the System Path Variable again:\n\nGo back to the \"Edit System Environment Variable\" window (like you did before).\nSelect the Path variable in \"System variables\" and click \"Edit...\".\nAdd a New Entry for the Python Installation Directory:\n\nClick \"New\" in the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\n\nEnter this path exactly:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\nImportant: Make sure you are adding C:\\Program Files\\Python313 (without \\Scripts at the end).\n\nVerify Both Paths are Now Present:\n\nYour \"Edit Environment Variable\" window for Path should now have at least two Python-related entries:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313 (this is the new one you are adding now)\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts (this one was already there, keep it)\nIt's OK if there are other paths in your Path variable as well; just ensure these two Python paths are present.\n\nClick \"OK\" on all Environment Variables windows to save.\n\nRestart your Command Prompt (or Restart Computer):\n\nIdeally, restart your computer completely to ensure the environment variables are fully refreshed system-wide. If you don't want to restart the computer right now, at least close all open command prompt windows and open a new one.\nTest python --version again in a new command prompt:\n\npython --version\nAfter making these changes and restarting (or opening a new command prompt), python --version should now work correctly and show you the Python version!\n\nPlease perform these steps carefully, making sure to add C:\\Program Files\\Python313 to your System Path (and keeping the Scripts path). Then, restart (or open a new command prompt) and test python --version. Let me know if it finally works!\n\nThis should be the final piece to get Python and pip working correctly!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
