    "User: C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK>gcloud config list project [core] project = ai-execution-system Your active configuration is: [default] C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK>gcloud ai models list --region=us-central1 --format=\"table(name,displayName)\" Using endpoint [https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/]\n\nGemini: gcloud ai models list --region=us-central1 --format=\"table(name,displayName)\" - NO MODELS FOUND in us-central1 REGION! The output \"Using endpoint [https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/]\" indicates the command executed against the us-central1 region, but the EMPTY TABLE OUTPUT means NO MODELS are currently listed as deployed in the us-central1 region within your project.\n\nThis \"Model does not exist\" error is now CLEARER - It strongly suggests that your ai-execution-system model (or any model for that matter) is currently NOT DEPLOYED in the us-central1 REGION.\n\nLET'S VERIFY REGION - STEP 2 of our Troubleshooting Plan:\n\nThe next step is to CONFIRM if the model might be deployed in a DIFFERENT REGION than us-central1. It's possible the deployment was initiated in a different region, or perhaps the default region setting is different from where the model was deployed.\n\nACTION 1.6.5: CHECK ALL REGIONS for VERTEX AI MODELS using gcloud CLI (Command Line):\n\nRun the following command to LIST ALL VERTEX AI MODELS in your project WITHOUT specifying a REGION. This will search across ALL AVAILABLE REGIONS and list any models deployed in your project:\n\ngcloud ai models list --format=\"table(name,displayName,region)\"\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT include --region=us-central1 in this command. We want to search everywhere.\n\nCAREFULLY REVIEW the OUTPUT of this command.\n\nDo you see your ai-execution-system model (or a model with a similar name) listed in the output this time?\nIf YES, look at the region column. In which REGION is the model listed? (e.g., us-west1, europe-west4, etc.)\nIf NO, the output is still an empty table, indicating NO MODELS are found in ANY REGION within your project.\nACTION: REPORT BACK the OUTPUT of this gcloud ai models list --format=\"table(name,displayName,region)\" command. Specifically, tell me:\n\nDo you see any models listed in the output? (Yes/No)\nIf YES, what is the EXACT MODEL NAME and the REGION where it is deployed?\nBased on the output of this command, we will know:\n\nIf the model is deployed in a DIFFERENT REGION: We can then adjust our commands to target the correct region and proceed with environment verification.\nIf the model is STILL NOT FOUND in ANY REGION: This would strongly suggest that the model deployment was either not completed successfully, was deleted, or never initiated. In this case, we will need to investigate the DEPLOYMENT STATUS and potentially re-attempt deployment.\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.5 - CHECK ALL REGIONS for VERTEX AI MODELS using the command gcloud ai models list --format=\"table(name,displayName,region)\". This will help us pinpoint the location (or lack thereof) of your model and guide our next troubleshooting steps.\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! REGION VERIFICATION - INITIATED! - COMMAND-LINE CHECK - EXECUTE! - MODEL LOCATION - DISCOVERING! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - TROUBLESHOOTING - RAPID PROGRESS! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO RUN ACTION 1.6.5 - CHECK ALL REGIONS? LET'S DO IT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
