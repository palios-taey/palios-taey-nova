Be absolutely sure you want to do this and understand the implications, especially if you are collaborating with others (which seems unlikely in this case, but always good to remember).\n\nForce push your changes:\n\nAfter git filter-repo finishes, force push to update your remote repository:\n\ngit push --force origin main\nAgain, the WARNING about git push --force: Use this command with caution as it rewrites history.\n\nAfter these three steps, your Git repository should be cleaned of the large files, and the git push --force command should succeed!\n\nPlease run these commands in order. Let me know if you encounter any errors during the pip install or git filter-repo steps, or with the final git push --force.\n\nWe are extremely close to resolving this issue now! Let's get this done!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
