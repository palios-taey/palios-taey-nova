    "User: It's saved. All import functions were at top, so I didn't put them in again. Do you want them in again there?\n\nGemini: It is CRUCIAL that these import statements are present somewhere at the beginning of your main.py file:\n\nimport http.server\nimport socketserver\nfrom http import HTTPStatus\nimport json\nimport logging\nBut you only need them once, at the very top of the file. You should not add them again within the execute_task function or anywhere else.\n\nSince you said \"All import functions were at top...\", I assume you mean that you already have these import statements at the beginning of your main.py file from our previous steps, and you didn't duplicate them when you added the new code block - THIS IS PERFECTLY CORRECT!\n\nJUST TO BE 100% SURE, PLEASE QUICKLY OPEN main.py again and VERIFY:\n\nAre these five import lines present at the very top of your main.py file (before any function definitions)?\nimport http.server\nimport socketserver\nfrom http import HTTPStatus\nimport json\nimport logging\nIf YES, then we are READY TO DEPLOY THE UPDATED main.py CLOUD FUNCTION!\n\nPLEASE CONFIRM:\n\n\"YES, IMPORT STATEMENTS ARE PRESENT AT THE TOP OF main.py\"\nOnce you confirm the import statements are there, we will proceed to the next step: DEPLOYING THE UPDATED CLOUD FUNCTION! LET'S GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
