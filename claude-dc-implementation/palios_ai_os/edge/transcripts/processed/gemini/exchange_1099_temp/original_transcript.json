C:\\Users\\jesse>\n\nGemini: Let's go through these verification steps very carefully:\n\nVerify git-filter-repo.exe in Scripts Directory (Again):\n\nPlease, one more time, double-check using File Explorer that the file git-filter-repo.exe is definitely located in this directory:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\nIt's crucial to be 100% certain it's there and that the filename is exactly git-filter-repo.exe (not misspelled, no extra spaces, etc.). Please confirm this exists.\n\nTest Running git-filter-repo.exe with Full Path:\n\nIn your command prompt, try running git-filter-repo by typing its full path, including the .exe extension and using double quotes:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\\git-filter-repo.exe\" --version\nWhat is the output of this command?\n\nIf this command works and shows the version of git-filter-repo: This means git-filter-repo.exe is functional, but there's still an issue with your PATH environment variable not being fully recognized by the command prompt for just the short command name git filter-repo. This is strange, but we can work around it if needed.\n\nIf this command still fails with the same \"'git' is not recognized...\" error: This would be very unexpected, but we need to know if this is the case.\n\nPlease run the full path command and tell me the exact output.\n\nVerify Scripts Directory in System Path (Again):\n\nLet's re-examine your System Path environment variable one more time using the text-based method we used last time to be absolutely sure C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts is in there correctly and there are no typos.\n\nOpen the Edit System Environment Variable window.\nEdit the Path variable.\nCarefully verify that C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts is present as a separate line in the list of paths. Double-check for any typos in the spelling or capitalization.\nIs C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts definitely in the System Path list, spelled correctly?\n\nRestart Computer (Again - Just to be absolutely sure):\n\nIf you haven't restarted since the last Path changes, please restart your Windows computer again. This is sometimes necessary to ensure all environment variable changes are fully loaded by all processes. After restarting, test git filter-repo --version again in a new command prompt.\n\nAfter you have meticulously performed and verified these 4 points, please provide me with the results for points 2, 3 and 1 (confirmation that git-filter-repo.exe exists). Based on this information, we will determine the next step. We are so close to resolving this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
