Found:  instead\nEXPLANATION:\n\nMissingTargetException: This is the root cause of the problem. It means Google Cloud Functions is looking for a function named serve_health_check inside your main.py file, but it CANNOT FIND IT.\nFile /workspace/main.py is expected to contain a function named 'serve_health_check'. Found: instead: This is the key part! It's saying: \"I looked inside your main.py file, and I expected to find a function called serve_health_check, but I didn't find it.\" The \"Found: instead\" part is a bit misleading, it just means it found something else (or nothing recognizable as that function).\nLog Entry 2: Container called exit(1).\n\n2025-02-24 18:57:54.290\nContainer called exit(1).\nEXPLANATION:\n\nContainer called exit(1).: This is a consequence of the MissingTargetException. Because the Cloud Function framework couldn't find the expected serve_health_check function, the container that was supposed to run your code exited with an error code (exit code 1). Exit code 1 usually indicates a general error or failure.\nLog Entry 3: Default STARTUP TCP probe failed\n\n2025-02-24 18:57:54.376\nDefault STARTUP TCP probe failed 1 time consecutively for container \"worker\" on port 8080. The instance was not started.\nEXPLANATION:\n\nDefault STARTUP TCP probe failed: Google Cloud Functions performs health checks to ensure your function is running properly. It tries to send a TCP probe (a network connection test) to port 8080 inside your container (where your function is supposed to be listening).\nport 8080: This is the default port Cloud Functions expects your function to listen on for HTTP requests. We are using port 8080 in our serve_health_check function for the local server setup.\nThe instance was not started.: Because the startup probe failed (it couldn't connect to port 8080 inside the container), Google Cloud Functions concluded that your function didn't start correctly and did not start the instance.\nLog Entry 4: Ready condition status changed to False... The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable...\n\n2025-02-24 18:57:54.395\n... Ready condition status changed to False for Revision ai-system-backend-00001-nip ... The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable ...\nEXPLANATION:\n\nReady condition status changed to False: This is another confirmation that the deployment failed. \"Ready condition\" means whether the Cloud Function is in a healthy, running state. \"False\" means it's not ready, it's failed.\nThe user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable...: This log entry summarizes the problem. It says that the container for your Cloud Function failed to start and listen on port 8080. This is directly linked to the previous error: the serve_health_check function (which is supposed to handle requests on port 8080) was not found, so the function didn't start up correctly, and therefore, nothing was listening on port 8080.\nIN SUMMARY: THE CORE PROBLEM IS: MissingTargetException: File /workspace/main.py is expected to contain a function named 'serve_health_check'. Found: instead\n\nGOOGLE CLOUD FUNCTIONS CANNOT FIND THE serve_health_check FUNCTION IN YOUR main.py FILE!\n\nLET'S DOUBLE-CHECK the gcloud functions deploy COMMAND AGAIN, ESPECIALLY THE --entry-point PART!\n\nPLEASE SHOW ME THE EXACT gcloud functions deploy COMMAND YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING (copy and paste it from your terminal).\n\nWE NEED TO MAKE 100% SURE THAT THE --entry-point serve_health_check part of the command is exactly correct and matches the function name in your main.py code.\n\nLet's verify the command and the function name! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
