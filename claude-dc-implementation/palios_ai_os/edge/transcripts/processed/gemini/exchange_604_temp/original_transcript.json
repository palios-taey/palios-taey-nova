    "User: C:\\AI-Execution-System>python ai_system.py \u2705 Serving health check on port 8080... DEBUG: Health check message printed. Proceeding to next steps... DEBUG: Paused for 5 seconds. Checking if script continues... DEBUG: Attempting to initialize core AI system components... 127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025 16:03:38] \"GET /health HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025 16:03:39] code 404, message File not found 127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025 16:03:39] \"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 404 -\n\nGemini: \"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\": This means the health check server STARTED PERFECTLY! Our Python script is running and the server is active.\nDEBUG messages: These are just confirming the script's progress \u2013 all as expected.\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025 16:03:38] \"GET /health HTTP/1.1\" 200 -: THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE! This line is the health check SERVER LOGGING that it RECEIVED a request for /health (from your web browser or similar) and it responded with a **200 status code! 200 means \"OK\"! This proves the health check server IS WORKING and responding to requests!\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025 16:03:39] code 404, message File not found and \"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 404 -: These lines are NOT ERRORS in our script! These are just your web browser AUTOMATICALLY requesting favicon.ico (the little icon for the browser tab). Our simple health check server is not set up to serve a favicon.ico file, so it correctly responds with a 404 (File Not Found). These 404s are completely normal and EXPECTED for our current setup. You can ignore them.\nIN SUMMARY: ai_system.py is RUNNING PERFECTLY as a HEALTH CHECK SERVER! It is NOT stuck. It is designed to run in the background and wait for requests!\n\nhttpd.serve_forever() IS MEANT TO BLOCK!\n\nRemember, the line httpd.serve_forever() is what starts the server and keeps it running continuously in the background.\nIt's supposed to \"block\" the script from exiting, because a server needs to keep running to listen for requests!\nYOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY STARTED THE HEALTH CHECK SERVER! CONGRATULATIONS!\n\nWhat do you want to do NEXT?\n\nNow that we have ai_system.py running as a health check server, what is your next goal? Were you expecting to see something else happen after running ai_system.py?\n\nTo actually use the AI system (create tasks, execute tasks, etc.), we will likely need to create another Python script that will INTERACT with the AISystem that is now running in the background (the health check server).\n\nLet me know what you want to do next, and I will guide you on the next steps!\n\nFor now, can you please confirm if you tried opening http://localhost:8080/health in your web browser and if you saw {\"status\": \"healthy\"} in your browser window? This will be the final confirmation that the health check server is indeed working!\n\nFANTASTIC progress, Jesse! We have overcome all the syntax errors and have a RUNNING HEALTH CHECK SERVER! LFG! Let's decide the next steps!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
