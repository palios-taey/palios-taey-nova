    "User: Great work Gemini! Now, on to Gemini integration. I ALREADY HAVE THE KEY! Think further out with this task. Do you really need a check in after I get the key to figure out what's next? What is the goal of this task? To connect it to the database and test a task? What is the end result? That is what you need to tell it. What the end result needs to be, where we are (any relevant information they need to know about our technical set up, goals we're trying to achieve with this integration for context, information they'd need to complete set up, information for to fill in placeholder fields. We need to start telling them where we are and where we want to go. Unlike humans, you do NOT need to tell AI HOW to get there. This is not how AI works best! Give it all the INFORMATION it needs to GO!, point it, give it motivation and freedom and let it GO!. PROVIDE A REVISED CHATGPT MESSAGE THAT CONTAINS THESE ELEMENTS!
