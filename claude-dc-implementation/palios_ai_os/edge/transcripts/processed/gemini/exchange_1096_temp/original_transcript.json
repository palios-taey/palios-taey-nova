    "User: Gemini, I don't know what is going on. Every time I add a Path, it deletes the old one. I'm clicking \"New\" but it overwrites whatever is there. I don't understand! It keeps trying to put it in my local drive under my user name. How do I deal with this?\n\nGemini: Here's the crucial thing to understand: In the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window, the Path variable is treated as a list of separate paths, even though it's displayed in a single text box in the older style interface (like in your screenshot). You need to add new paths as separate entries in this list, not by directly editing the whole text value.\n\nLet's go through the steps again, very carefully, to ADD the Python Scripts directory to your System Path without deleting anything else:\n\nOpen the \"Edit System Environment Variable\" window just like you did before (Windows key -> \"environment variables\" -> \"Edit the system environment variables\" -> \"Environment Variables...\").\n\nSelect the Path variable in the \"System variables\" section (bottom half of the window).\n\nClick the \"Edit...\" button. This opens the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window. This is where it's important to do it correctly:\n\nDO NOT directly edit the large text box that contains all the paths. This is where you might be going wrong. If you try to type directly in this box, you will likely overwrite the existing paths.\n\nInstead, look for the \"New\" button in the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window. It should be on the right side of the list of paths (see your screenshot - \"New...\", \"Edit...\", \"Delete\" buttons are there).\n\nClick the \"New\" button. When you click \"New\", a new empty line will appear at the bottom of the list of paths.\n\nIn this new empty line, type or paste the Python Scripts directory path:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\nAfter typing the path, press Enter or click outside the line to confirm the entry. You should see C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts added as a separate entry in the list.\n\nRepeat Step 3 to Add the Main Python Directory (if needed):\n\nIf you also need to add the main Python installation directory (C:\\Program Files\\Python313), click \"New\" again and add:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\nand press Enter.\n\nVerify the Paths are Correctly Added:\n\nCarefully scroll through the list of paths in the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\nConfirm that you see BOTH of these paths as separate entries in the list:\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\nAlso, check that your other existing paths are still in the list as well. Adding new paths using \"New\" should not delete your existing paths. They should all be in the list.\nClick \"OK\" on all Environment Variables windows to save.\n\nRestart your Command Prompt (or Restart Computer):\n\nClose your current command prompt window.\nOpen a new command prompt window.\nTest git filter-repo command again:\n\nIn the new command prompt, type:\n\ngit filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform\nand press Enter.\n\nPlease follow these steps exactly, especially making sure to use the \"New\" button to add paths, not directly edit the main text box. Then, let me know if the git filter-repo command is now recognized!\n\nTake your time and be precise with each step. We will get this working!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
