    "User: What about extending the health check?\n\nGemini: Here's why:\n\nThe ERROR we are seeing is still ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'. This error happens VERY EARLY in the application startup process, before the Flask application even gets to the point of starting its web server and listening on port 8080.\nHealth checks happen later in the startup process, after the container has started and is supposed to be listening on the port. Cloud Run checks if your application is healthy by trying to connect to it on port 8080.\nBecause app.py is crashing with ModuleNotFoundError: flask right at the beginning, your application is never actually starting properly and listening on port 8080 in the first place. Therefore, extending the health check timeout won't help, because the problem is happening before the health check even begins to matter.\n\nThink of it like this: Imagine you are trying to start a car, but the engine won't even turn over because there's no fuel. Extending the time you wait for the car to start won't magically create fuel! In our case, ModuleNotFoundError: flask is like \"no fuel\" for your Flask application.\n\nExtending the health check timeout is more useful in situations where:\n\nYour application does eventually start and listen on the port, but it takes a long time to initialize or become ready to serve traffic.\nYou are seeing errors that specifically mention \"health check failed because timeout was too short\".\nFor our current ModuleNotFoundError: flask error, the problem is more fundamental: Python cannot even find the flask library.\n\nBefore we try extending health check timeouts (which we can do later if needed), let's FIRST focus on ensuring that flask is actually correctly installed and available in your Docker image.\n\nHave you made the two critical changes I asked you to make in the last SPECIAL INSTRUCTION?\n\nCorrected app.py: Made sure it is the minimal Flask app with debug=False and port from os.environ.get('PORT', 8080).\nUpdated Dockerfile CMD: Changed CMD to CMD [\"flask\", \"run\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\", \"--port=$PORT\"].\nIf you have made those changes, please re-run universal-deploy-script.sh and let's see if we get a different error message this time, or if the ModuleNotFoundError: flask persists. We need to tackle the flask error first, and then we can consider health check timeouts if the problem persists.\n\nLet's make sure those two critical code changes are in place and re-deploy. What is the output after re-deploying with the corrected app.py and Dockerfile? Let's focus on that for now! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
