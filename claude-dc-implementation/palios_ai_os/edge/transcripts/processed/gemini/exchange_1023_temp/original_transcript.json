OK Setting IAM Policy... Deployment failed ERROR: (gcloud.run.deploy) Revision 'ai-execution-system-core-00004-w6l' is not ready and cannot serve traffic. The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable within the allocated timeout. This can happen when the container port is misconfigured or if the timeout is too short. The health check timeout can be extended. Logs for this revision might contain more information.

Service URL: Health endpoint: /health Task endpoint: /task \u2713 Deployment script execution completed.\n\nGemini: SPECIAL INSTRUCTION:\n\nMODIFY Dockerfile AGAIN:\n\nOpen your Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ in a text editor.\n\nADD this line to your Dockerfile IMMEDIATELY AFTER the line COPY . /app/:\n\nRUN ls -l /app/\nYour Dockerfile (in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\) should now look like this:\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster  # Use slim-buster base image (more complete)\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nCOPY . /app/  # <---- CHANGE THIS LINE to COPY . /app/ (explicit target path)\nRUN ls -l /app/  # <---- ADD THIS LINE - DEBUGGING: LIST FILES IN /app/\n\nENV PORT=8080\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]  # <---- CHANGE THIS LINE to use app.py as entry point\n(Make sure you add RUN ls -l /app/ exactly as shown, after COPY . /app/).\n\nSAVE the modified Dockerfile.\n\nRun universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN:\n\nIn Git Bash, in the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\ directory, run:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nGO TO the CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL:\n\nAfter running universal-deploy-script.sh, look in the output for the Cloud Build Logs URL. It will be something like https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds/....\nOPEN THIS URL in your web browser.\nFIND the ls -l /app/ OUTPUT in CLOUD BUILD LOGS:\n\nIn the Cloud Build logs page, look for the \"build\" step (it might be step 0 or step 1, look for step names like \"build\", \"docker-build\", etc.).\nWithin the logs of the \"build\" step, SCROLL DOWN until you find the output of the RUN ls -l /app/ command. It will look like a file listing, starting with lines like total ... and then lines showing file permissions, sizes, dates, and filenames (e.g., -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... app.py).\nCOPY and PASTE the ENTIRE ls -l /app/ OUTPUT from the Cloud Build logs HERE. This is crucial! We need to see this file listing to diagnose the ModuleNotFoundError.\n\nAfter you have added RUN ls -l /app/ to your Dockerfile, re-run the deployment, and found the ls -l /app/ output in the Cloud Build logs, please COPY and PASTE the ls -l /app/ output here.\n\nThis file listing will give us the definitive answer to why config_loader is not being found! Let's get that log output! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
