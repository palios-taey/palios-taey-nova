    "User: It was previously this, you had me comment it out: # automatic = true\n\nGemini: The Situation:\n\nPrevious Error: \"Unsupported argument: automatic\": This error, which we resolved by commenting out # automatic = true, indicated that the Terraform version or provider version we were using at that time did not recognize or accept the automatic argument directly at the top level of the google_secret_manager_secret resource block. It was as if automatic was not a valid top-level argument.\n\nCurrent Error: \"Invalid combination of arguments... one of replication.0.auto,replication.0.user_managed must be specified\": This NEW error, which we are seeing now, is telling us something different. It is specifically related to the replication {} block within the google_secret_manager_secret resource. It's saying that inside the replication {} block, we must specify EITHER auto OR user_managed. It's no longer complaining about the automatic argument itself being invalid, but rather about the lack of a required argument within the replication block.\n\nWhat Changed? Why the different errors?\n\nIt's possible that:\n\nTerraform Provider Version Update: When you ran terraform init again (which you've done multiple times throughout this process), Terraform might have updated the google provider to a newer version. Newer versions of Terraform providers can sometimes have slightly different argument requirements or introduce new features and deprecate old ones.\nSlight Misunderstanding Earlier: It's also possible that there was a slight misunderstanding earlier about where the automatic = true line was supposed to be placed. Perhaps I initially had you comment it out in the wrong place, or maybe the error message was initially misleading.\nThe Correct Solution NOW (based on the current error):\n\nBased on the current error message \"Invalid combination of arguments... replication.0.auto or replication.0.user_managed must be specified\", and based on my understanding of the google_secret_manager_secret resource in Terraform, the correct configuration NOW is to have auto = true; inside the replication {} block.\n\nTherefore, YES, please UNCOMMENT or RE-ADD the line auto = true; INSIDE the replication {} blocks in your main.tf file, as I instructed in the previous response.\n\nTo be absolutely clear, your main.tf should look like this AGAIN:\n\nresource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\" {\n  secret_id = \"openai-api-key\"\n  replication {\n    auto = true;  # UNCOMMENT or RE-ADD this line\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\" {\n  secret_id = \"gemini-api-key\"\n  replication {\n    auto = true;  # UNCOMMENT or RE-ADD this line\n  }\n}\nMy apologies for any confusion caused by the previous instructions! Debugging complex systems like this often involves iterative steps and adapting to new error messages as we progress. You are doing a great job by carefully observing the errors and questioning instructions when things seem inconsistent!\n\nPlease UNCOMMENT or RE-ADD auto = true in main.tf NOW, and then re-run bash deploy.sh and enter your API keys interactively. Let's see if this resolves the \"Invalid combination of arguments\" error and allows Terraform plan and apply to succeed! LFG! We are learning and making progress with every step!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
