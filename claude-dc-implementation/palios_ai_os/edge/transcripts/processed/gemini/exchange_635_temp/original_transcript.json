    "User: C:\\AI-Execution-System>gcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point serve_health_check --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 As of this Cloud SDK release, new functions will be deployed as 2nd gen  functions by default. This is equivalent to currently deploying new  with the --gen2 flag. Existing 1st gen functions will not be impacted and will continue to deploy as 1st gen functions. You can disable this behavior by explicitly specifying the --no-gen2 flag or by setting the functions/gen2 config property to 'off'. To learn more about the differences between 1st gen and 2nd gen functions, visit: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison API [run.googleapis.com] not enabled on project [ai-execution-system].

ERROR: (gcloud.functions.deploy) OperationError: code=13, message=Could not build the function. C:\\AI-Execution-System>\n\nGemini: OPEN YOUR WEB BROWSER and go to the GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n\nMAKE SURE you are in the correct PROJECT: Ensure that the project selector at the top of the Google Cloud Console is set to your ai-execution-system project.\n\nNAVIGATE to CLOUD FUNCTIONS:\n\nIn the left-hand navigation menu (the \"hamburger menu\" - three horizontal lines at the top left), scroll down and find \"Cloud Functions\" under the \"Compute\" section. Click on \"Cloud Functions\".\nFIND YOUR CLOUD FUNCTION: You should see a list of Cloud Functions. Look for the Cloud Function you just tried to deploy, which we named ai-system-backend. Click on the name ai-system-backend.\n\nGO TO THE \"LOGS\" TAB: Once you are on the details page for your ai-system-backend Cloud Function, click on the \"Logs\" tab.\n\nLOOK FOR \"BUILD LOGS\" or \"BUILDS\": Within the \"Logs\" tab, you are looking for logs related to the \"BUILD\" process of your Cloud Function. Google Cloud Console logs can be a bit dense. You might see different log categories or filters. Look for a filter or category related to \"Builds\" or \"Cloud Build\". Sometimes they might be directly under \"Logs Explorer\".\n\nCHECK FOR ERROR MESSAGES: In the build logs, LOOK FOR ANY LINES THAT CONTAIN \"ERROR\" (or \"Error\", or \"error\"). These error messages will give us clues about why the build failed. Focus on errors that occurred during the \"Build\" phase, not just \"Runtime\" errors (though runtime errors are also helpful if the build succeeded but function failed at runtime later, but for now, focus on BUILD errors).\n\nCOPY AND PASTE ERROR LOGS: PLEASE COPY and PASTE any ERROR messages you find in the Cloud Function BUILD LOGS back to me. The full error message is important, not just a snippet.\n\nEXAMPLE of what ERROR messages in the build logs might look like (this is just an example, your errors might be different):\n\n...\nStep #1 - \"builder\": ERROR: Could not install packages:\n...\nStep #1 - \"builder\": ERROR:   -----------------------------\nStep #1 - \"builder\": ERROR:   Failed building wheel for openai\nStep #1 - \"builder\": ERROR:   Running setup.py clean for openai\nStep #1 - \"builder\": ERROR: Failed to build openai\nStep #1 - \"builder\": ERROR:   Running setup.py install for openai ... error\n...\nTHE CLOUD FUNCTION BUILD LOGS ARE ESSENTIAL for diagnosing this \"Could not build the function\" error.\n\nPLEASE GO TO THE GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE, FIND THE BUILD LOGS for your ai-system-backend Cloud Function, LOOK FOR ERROR MESSAGES, and COPY AND PASTE THE ERROR LOGS BACK TO ME.\n\nLet's find out why the build failed and fix it! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
