    "User: of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend {\"error\": \"Exception in execute_task: module 'google.cloud.aiplatform' has no attribute 'TextModel'\"} C:\\AI-Execution-System> I copied and pasted your code\n\nGemini: I suspect the issue might be related to the VERSION of the google-cloud-aiplatform library that is being used in the Cloud Function environment. It's possible the environment is using an older version where TextGenerationModel (or TextModel) might not be available as we are trying to use it.\n\nLET'S TRY THIS: WE WILL EXPLICITLY SPECIFY THE google-cloud-aiplatform LIBRARY VERSION in our requirements.txt file! This will ensure that Cloud Functions uses a more recent version that does include TextGenerationModel.\n\nSTEP 1: REVERT main.py - CHANGE BACK TO TextGenerationModel\n\nPlease OPEN main.py in your CODE EDITOR again.\n\nFIND THIS LINE in your execute_task function (if you changed it in the last step):\n\ngeneration_model = aiplatform.TextModel.from_pretrained(\"text-bison@001\")\nCHANGE it BACK to:\n\ngeneration_model = aiplatform.TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained(\"text-bison@001\")\nREVERT IT BACK to TextGenerationModel!\n\nAFTER MAKING THIS CHANGE, PLEASE SAVE main.py.\n\nSTEP 2: MODIFY requirements.txt - SPECIFY google-cloud-aiplatform VERSION\n\nPlease OPEN requirements.txt in your CODE EDITOR.\n\nADD this line to the requirements.txt file:\n\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0: This line explicitly tells pip (the Python package installer) to install google-cloud-aiplatform version 1.27.0 or any later version (>=). 1.27.0 is a relatively recent version of the library. (We can adjust the version later if needed).\nSAVE requirements.txt after adding this line.\n\nSTEP 3: RE-DEPLOY the Cloud Function with UPDATED main.py and requirements.txt\n\nEXECUTE the SAME gcloud functions deploy COMMAND again in your terminal:\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point execute_task --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\nIMPORTANT: We are using the same deployment command, but now we are deploying with the corrected main.py (back to TextGenerationModel) and the updated requirements.txt (specifying the library version).\nSTEP 4: RE-TEST the ECHO TASK (now AI Task) using the SAME curl command as before:\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend\nWE ARE HOPING that by specifying the library version in requirements.txt, the Cloud Function environment will use a version of google-cloud-aiplatform that does have the TextGenerationModel class, and this time the test will be successful!\n\nPLEASE MAKE the CODE CHANGES in main.py (revert to TextGenerationModel), MODIFY requirements.txt (add version specifier), SAVE BOTH FILES, RE-DEPLOY, and then RUN THE curl TEST COMMAND AGAIN!\n\nREPORT BACK IMMEDIATELY after running the curl command with the TERMINAL OUTPUT and whether you see the EXPECTED JSON RESPONSE with the AI-generated summary!\n\nLET'S GET THIS WORKING! THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM! GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT! WE ARE REALLY CLOSE THIS TIME!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
