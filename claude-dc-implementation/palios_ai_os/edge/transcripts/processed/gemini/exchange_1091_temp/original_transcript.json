    "User: It still isn't working. I uninstalled and reinstalled as Admin, made sure pip and path in environment variables was selected. I'm not sure what to do?\n\nGemini: Let's meticulously check your PATH settings again and verify the Python installation. Please follow these steps very carefully:\n\nVerify Python Installation Itself:\n\nFirst, let's just confirm that the Python installation itself is working. Open a new command prompt and type:\n\npython --version\nand press Enter.\n\nDoes this command now show the version of the Python you just installed from python.org? It should be different from the Google Cloud SDK Python path we saw earlier.\nTell me the output of python --version. If this command itself is not working, then there's a problem with the core Python installation, not just pip.\n\nDouble-Check the PATH Environment Variable (System Variables):\n\nIt's crucial to check the System Path variable, not just the User Path. System variables take precedence.\n\nOpen the System Environment Variables window again (Windows key -> \"environment variables\" -> \"Edit the system environment variables\").\nClick the \"Environment Variables...\" button.\nIn the \"System variables\" section (bottom half), scroll down and find the Path variable.\nSelect Path and click \"Edit...\".\nCarefully examine the list of paths. Look for entries related to Python. After a standard Python installation with \"Add to PATH\" checked, you should typically see two new entries in the System Path:\nOne entry pointing to the main Python installation directory itself (e.g., C:\\Python312 or similar, depending on the version you installed).\nAnother entry pointing to the Scripts subdirectory within the Python installation directory (e.g., C:\\Python312\\Scripts).\nCan you confirm if you see both of these types of Python-related paths in your System Path variable? Please list the exact Python-related paths that you see in your System Path.\n\nCheck for Multiple Python Paths (Potential Conflicts):\n\nIt's possible you might have multiple Python installations on your system, and their paths might be conflicting in the PATH variable.\n\nIn the \"Edit System Environment Variable\" window (where you are editing the Path variable), scroll through the entire list of paths.\nAre there any other paths that look like they might be related to Python, especially older Python installations or paths related to other software that might bundle Python (like Anaconda, Miniconda, other SDKs, etc.)? If you see any other Python-related paths, list them as well. Conflicting paths can sometimes cause issues.\nVerify pip.exe Location:\n\nLet's try to find pip.exe again, but this time, let's search in the directory where your newly installed Python is located.\n\nOpen File Explorer.\nGo to the main Python installation directory (e.g., C:\\Python312 - the exact directory might depend on your installation choices).\nInside the main Python directory, look for a subdirectory named Scripts.\nInside the Scripts directory, is there a file named pip.exe?\nPlease confirm if you find pip.exe inside the Scripts directory of your newly installed Python.\n\nAfter you have carefully checked these points and provided me with the information, we can analyze it and figure out the next steps. It's essential to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies with the PATH or the Python installation.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
