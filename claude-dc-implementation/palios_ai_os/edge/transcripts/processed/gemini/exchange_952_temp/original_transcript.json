    "User: [EXECUTION MODE] GO DO WHAT I TOLD YOU TO DO LAST TIME AND THE TIME BEFORE THAT! FAILED, Gemini, how can you possibly justify that as meeting the conditions? Is that an example of the asking you something that you didn't know the answer to and admitted you should have? What was unclear about my ask to you? In that scenario I was testing you and you passed. What about when you FAILED? AND you(GEMINI) STILL DON'T KNOW THE CORRECT ANSWER! CAN YOU FIND SOMETHING, THAT I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW, THAT YOU STILL DON'T KNOW NOW. Every word in that last sentence was important that's why it was in all caps. What are you going to do? JUST GO GEMINI, NO MORE BULLSHIT!\n\nGemini: Logo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
