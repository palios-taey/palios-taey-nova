    "User: C:\\Users\\jesse>pip show git-filter-repo Name: git-filter-repo Version: 2.47.0 Summary: Quickly rewrite git repository history Home-page: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo Author: Author-email: Elijah Newren <newren@gmail.com> License: MIT Location: C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python313\\site-packages Requires: Required-by:\n\nGemini: Location: C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python313\\site-packages\nThis explains why git filter-repo.exe is not in C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts. pip installed it in your user-specific Python package location instead of the system-wide location.\n\nLet's fix this by explicitly using the pip that is associated with your system-wide Python installation to reinstall git-filter-repo.\n\nPlease try this command, using the full path to your system-wide pip.exe:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\\pip.exe\" uninstall git-filter-repo\nand press Enter. This command will first uninstall the user-level installation of git-filter-repo. Answer y if it asks for confirmation to uninstall.\n\nAfter it uninstalls, immediately run this command again using the full path to pip.exe:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\\pip.exe\" install git-filter-repo\nand press Enter. This will reinstall git-filter-repo, but this time, we are explicitly telling pip to use the pip.exe from your system-wide Python installation. Hopefully, this will install git-filter-repo in the correct location.\n\nAfter running these two commands (uninstall and reinstall using the full path to pip.exe), please do the following:\n\nCheck for git-filter-repo.exe in Scripts Directory AGAIN:\n\nGo back to C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts using File Explorer and verify if git-filter-repo.exe is now present in this directory.\n\nTest git filter-repo --version in Command Prompt:\n\nOpen a new command prompt and try running:\n\ngit filter-repo --version\nDoes it work this time? Does it show the version of git-filter-repo without errors?\n\nLet me know the results of these steps. Did git-filter-repo.exe appear in Scripts? And does git filter-repo --version now work in a new command prompt?\n\nBy explicitly using the full path to the system pip.exe, we should be able to force the installation to the correct system-wide location. Let's see if this works!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
