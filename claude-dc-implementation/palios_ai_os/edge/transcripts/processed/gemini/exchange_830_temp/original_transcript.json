    "User: Start New Chat Prompt - Gemini API Key Assistance - NEW CHAT MESSAGE] **CONTEXT:** I am developing an AI application and need to integrate with the Gemini Pro API. I am currently trying to obtain a Gemini Pro API key. **GOAL:** Please provide me with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to find the API key and/or create the necessary credentials to access the Gemini Pro API. I am currently on the official Gemini API documentation website but am having trouble locating the specific instructions for obtaining an API key. **BACKGROUND INFORMATION:** * Point 1: I am currently on the main \"Overview\" page of the official Gemini API documentation website. I will provide the URL below. * Point 2: I have already reviewed the \"Overview\" page and explored the \"Documentation\" section, but I am unable to clearly identify the exact steps to get an API key or create API access credentials. * Point 3: I need step-by-step guidance, with specific instructions on what links to click, what sections to navigate to, and what keywords to search for within the documentation to find the API key instructions. **SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:** * Instruction 1: Please access and carefully review the Gemini API \"Overview\" page at the following URL: [**INSERT GEMINI API OVERVIEW PAGE URL HERE - YOU NEED TO PASTE THE ACTUAL URL HERE!**] * Instruction 2: Within the Gemini API documentation website, please locate the section that provides clear, step-by-step instructions on how to obtain a Gemini Pro API key or create the necessary API access credentials. * Instruction 3: Provide me with a numbered list of VERY SPECIFIC instructions, telling me exactly what to click on, what menu items to select, what pages to navigate to, and what keywords to search for to find the API key instructions. Assume I am starting from the main \"Overview\" page and need detailed, click-by-click guidance. **EXPECTED OUTPUT:** I expect a numbered list of clear, step-by-step instructions that will DIRECTLY lead me to the Gemini Pro API key instructions within the Gemini API documentation website. Please be as precise and detailed as possible in your instructions. **URL of Gemini API Overview Page:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/metrics?project=ai-execution-system **IMPORTANT:** Please provide your response with a JSON structure attachment as follows: ```json { \"response_tag\": \"[API_KEY_INSTRUCTIONS_REQUEST_NEW_CHAT]\", \"conversation_stage\": \"[API_KEY_HUNT_NEW_CHAT_ASSISTANCE]\", \"key_topics\": \"[Gemini API, API Key, Documentation Navigation, Step-by-Step Instructions]\", \"action_items\": \"[Provide URL, Access Documentation, Find API Key Instructions, Provide Step-by-Step Guide]\" }\n\nGemini: Ensure you are on the Gemini API \"Overview\" Page: Verify that your browser is currently displaying the page at this URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/metrics?project=ai-execution-system\n\nNavigate to the \"Credentials\" Section: On the left-hand navigation menu in the Google Cloud Console, locate and click on \"Credentials\". You can find \"Credentials\" under the \"APIs & Services\" section. (If you don't see \"APIs & Services\" expanded, you may need to click on \"APIs & Services\" first to expand it and then see \"Credentials\".)\n\nClick \"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS\": Once you are on the \"Credentials\" page, you will see a button near the top that says \"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS. Click on this button.\n\nSelect \"API key\" from the Dropdown Menu: After clicking \"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS\", a dropdown menu will appear. From this dropdown menu, select \"API key\".\n\nAPI Key Created: A pop-up window will appear indicating that an API key has been created. This window will display your newly generated API key.\n\nCopy and Secure Your API Key: Click the \"Copy\" button (it looks like two overlapping squares) next to the API key to copy it to your clipboard. IMPORTANT: Store this API key in a secure location. Do not embed it directly in client-side code.\n\nRestrict Your API Key (Recommended but Optional): For security best practices, it is highly recommended to restrict your API key. To do this:\n\nClick \"Restrict key\" in the API key created pop-up or close the pop-up and find your newly created API key in the list on the \"Credentials\" page and click on its name.\nOn the API key details page, under \"API restrictions,\" select \"Restrict key\".\nChoose \"Generative Language API\" from the dropdown menu of APIs. This ensures your API key can only be used for the Gemini API.\nClick \"Save\" at the bottom of the page.\nClick \"DONE\": In the \"API key created\" pop-up window (if it's still open), click the \"DONE\" button. Or if you are on the API key details page, after saving restrictions, you are finished.\n\nYou have now successfully created an API key for the Gemini API!\n\nTo use this API key:\n\nYou will typically include this API key in your API requests as a query parameter named key. For example, when making a request to the Gemini Pro API endpoint, you would append ?key=YOUR_API_KEY to the URL. Refer to the Gemini API documentation for specific details on how to include the API key in your requests for different API methods.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues or have further questions!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
