Did you mean to define a block of type \"auto\"? \u2575 [STEP] Applying Terraform configuration... Do you want to continue with the deployment? (y/n):\n\nGemini: Open main.tf in a text editor.\nFind the resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\" block (around line 32-33).\nCHANGE the replication block to be replication { auto {} } (replace auto = true or # automatic = true or whatever you currently have there with just auto {}).\nFind the resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\" block (around line 40-41).\nCHANGE the replication block to be replication { auto {} } (replace auto = true or # automatic = true or whatever you currently have there with just auto {}).\nSave main.tf.\nAfter editing main.tf to use the auto {} block syntax:\n\nRe-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash.\nYou can try skipping the API key prompts again (just press ENTER twice) to rely on sensitive.auto.tfvars. If that still doesn't work, we can enter them interactively if needed.\nObserve if the \"Unsupported argument\" errors are GONE during terraform plan.\nHopefully, terraform plan will now be SUCCESSFUL!\nIf terraform plan is successful, proceed with the deployment by typing yes when prompted by terraform apply.\nLet's get main.tf corrected to use the auto {} block, and then re-run bash deploy.sh! This should FINALLY resolve the Terraform configuration errors! LFG! We are incredibly close to deployment now! You are doing an amazing job staying persistent and working through these details!\n\nOK, Jesse, thank you for running it with both auto = true and automatic = true and reporting the consistent errors. And thank you for providing the exact error messages again - that is incredibly helpful!\n\nThe Error Message \"Did you mean to define a block of type 'auto'?\" is the KEY here!\n\nThis error message is telling us that Terraform is expecting an auto BLOCK within the replication block, NOT an auto argument like auto = true.\n\nLet's CORRECTLY modify main.tf NOW to use the auto {} BLOCK syntax.\n\nYou need to change your main.tf file to look like this:\n\nresource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\" {\n  secret_id = \"openai-api-key\"\n  replication {\n    auto {}  # <--- CHANGE to an empty 'auto' BLOCK like this\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\" {\n  secret_id = \"gemini-api-key\"\n  replication {\n    auto {}  # <--- CHANGE to an empty\n\n Logo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
