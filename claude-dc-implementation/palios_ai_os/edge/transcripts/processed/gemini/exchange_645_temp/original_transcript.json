    "User: I copy/pasted from you: C:\\AI-Execution-System>gcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point serve_health_check --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\n\nGemini: LET'S DO A SUPER-DETAILED, LETTER-BY-LETTER CHECK OF THE serve_health_check FUNCTION DEFINITION IN YOUR main.py FILE.\n\nPLEASE OPEN main.py in your CODE EDITOR and CAREFULLY COMPARE YOUR serve_health_check FUNCTION DEFINITION to this EXACT CODE BLOCK:\n\ndef serve_health_check(request):\n    \"\"\"HTTP Cloud Function for health check.\"\"\"\n    PORT = 8080  # Port is not actually used in Cloud Functions, but keep for consistency\n\n    class HealthCheckHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler): # Keep HealthCheckHandler definition inside the function scope\n        def do_GET(self):\n            if self.path == '/health':\n                self.send_response(HTTPStatus.OK)\n                self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')\n                self.end_headers()\n                response_content = json.dumps({\"status\": \"healthy\"})\n                self.wfile.write(response_content.encode())\n            else:\n                super().do_GET()\n\n    # We don't actually start a server in Cloud Functions like we do locally.\n    # Just return a health status directly for the HTTP trigger.\n    return {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"} # Modified health check response for Cloud Functions\nPLEASE CHECK THESE THINGS VERY, VERY CAREFULLY, LETTER-BY-LETTER and LINE-BY-LINE:\n\nFUNCTION NAME SPELLING: Is the function name exactly serve_health_check (all lowercase, underscore _ in the middle, no typos)?\nFUNCTION DEFINITION def serve_health_check(request):: Is it exactly def serve_health_check(request): with the parentheses and request parameter?\nINDENTATION: Is the indentation of all lines inside the serve_health_check function exactly as shown above? Python indentation is crucial. Make sure there are no extra spaces or tabs where they shouldn't be, and that lines are indented correctly within the function and within the HealthCheckHandler class.\nCLASS HealthCheckHandler DEFINITION: Is the class HealthCheckHandler defined inside the serve_health_check function, exactly as shown? Check the class name spelling, parentheses, inheritance (http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler), and indentation of the class definition.\ndo_GET(self): METHOD within HealthCheckHandler: Is the do_GET(self): method defined inside the HealthCheckHandler class with the correct spelling and self parameter? Check indentation.\nCODE WITHIN do_GET: Compare the code inside the do_GET method line-by-line. Check for correct spelling of self.path, self.send_response, self.send_header, self.end_headers, json.dumps, self.wfile.write, and super().do_GET(). Check indentation.\nreturn {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"}: Is this return statement outside the HealthCheckHandler class but inside the serve_health_check function, and is it spelled exactly as shown? Check indentation.\nPLEASE GO THROUGH YOUR main.py FILE and COMPARE IT VERY METICULOUSLY TO THE CODE BLOCK ABOVE, CHECKING EVERY LETTER, SYMBOL, AND INDENTATION.\n\nREPORT BACK:\n\n\"VERIFIED serve_health_check FUNCTION - EXACT MATCH!\" If you have carefully compared and confirmed that your serve_health_check function in main.py is an exact match (including spelling, indentation, parameters, and code within).\n\"FOUND and CORRECTED ERROR in serve_health_check function.\" If you found any difference or error, please describe what you corrected (e.g., \"typo in function name\", \"incorrect indentation in do_GET\", etc.).\nLet's eliminate any possible errors in the serve_health_check function definition itself! This very precise check is crucial! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
