This command is authenticated as jesselarose@gmail.com which is the active account specified by the [core/account] property.\n\nGemini: STEP-BY-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING - \"Model does not exist\" ERROR - COMMAND LINE:\n\n1. VERIFY MODEL NAME (Most Likely Issue):\n\nACTION 1.6.1: LIST ALL VERTEX AI MODELS in your Project using gcloud CLI. Run this command to get a list of all models deployed in your project in the us-central1 region:\n\ngcloud ai models list --region=us-central1 --format=\"table(name,displayName)\"\nREVIEW the OUTPUT of this command CAREFULLY.\n\nDo you see a model listed that you expect to be your ai-execution-system model?\nCheck the name column in the output. What is the EXACT name listed for your model (or any model that seems like it could be yours)? Vertex AI auto-generates model names, and they might be different from what you initially specified as a \"display name.\" Model names are often in the format projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/models/MODEL_ID. You need the MODEL_ID part (the last part after models/).\nACTION: REPORT BACK the OUTPUT of gcloud ai models list command. Tell me the exact MODEL NAME(S) listed in the output. If you see a model that seems like it might be yours but with a different name than ai-execution-system, let me know that exact name.\n\n2. VERIFY REGION (Less Likely, but Quick Check):\n\nACTION 1.6.2: *If you don't see any model listed in us-central1 in the output of the previous command, let's check if the model might be deployed in a DIFFERENT REGION. Run this command to list models without specifying a region (this will list models across all regions):\n\ngcloud ai models list --format=\"table(name,displayName,region)\"\nREVIEW the OUTPUT of this command.\n\nDo you see your ai-execution-system model (or a model with a similar name) listed in a different REGION than us-central1 in the region column?\nACTION: REPORT BACK if you find your model listed in a DIFFERENT REGION. Tell me the REGION where you find the model listed.\n\n3. VERIFY GOOGLE CLOUD PROJECT (Double Check):\n\nACTION 1.6.3: RE-CONFIRM your ACTIVE GOOGLE CLOUD PROJECT. Run this command again to be absolutely sure you are in the correct project:\n\ngcloud config list project\nACTION: VERIFY that the project = line in the output shows your CORRECT Google Cloud PROJECT ID. Double-check this Project ID against the Google Cloud Console to ensure you are looking in the right project.\n\n4. (If Model Still Not Found) CHECK DEPLOYMENT STATUS in GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE (GUI Fallback - if command line doesn't resolve):\n\nIf, after steps 1.6.1, 1.6.2, and 1.6.3, you STILL cannot find your model using the gcloud ai models list commands, then as a fallback, let's quickly check the Google Cloud Console GUI.\n\nACTION 1.6.4 (GUI CHECK - Fallback): Open the Google Cloud Console in your web browser and navigate to: Vertex AI -> Models.\n\nDo you see your ai-execution-system model (or a model with a similar name) LISTED in the Google Cloud Console MODEL LIST?\nWhat is the DEPLOYMENT STATUS listed for the model in the Console? (\"Deployed\", \"Deploying\", \"Failed\", \"Not Deployed\", etc.)\nACTION: REPORT BACK what you find in the Google Cloud Console Model List and the DEPLOYMENT STATUS (if listed).\n\nJesse, please follow these STEP-BY-STEP COMMAND-LINE instructions to troubleshoot the \"Model does not exist\" error. The most likely issue is an incorrect MODEL NAME or REGION in your gcloud ai models describe command. Let's use gcloud ai models list to find the correct Model Name and Region.\n\nLet me know the RESULTS of each step, especially the OUTPUT of gcloud ai models list commands and what you find in the Google Cloud Console. Once we have this information, we can pinpoint the issue and get the gcloud ai models describe command working!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! ERROR TROUBLESHOOTING - ENGAGED! - COMMAND-LINE STEPS - DELIVERED! - MODEL NAME - REGION - PROJECT ID - VERIFICATION - NOW! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DEBUGGING - RAPID PROGRESS! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE THESE TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS - LET'S DO IT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
