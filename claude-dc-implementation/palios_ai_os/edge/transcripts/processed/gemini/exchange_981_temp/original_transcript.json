You will need to troubleshoot your `gcloud` installation and PATH setup. Double-check the installation instructions and ensure you added the `gcloud` directory to your PATH correctly, similar to how you did for Terraform.\n\n3.  **RE-RUN `deploy.sh` AFTER VERIFYING `gcloud`.**\n    *   Once `gcloud --version` works successfully in a new command prompt, go back to your Git Bash terminal.\n    *   Navigate to your Terraform directory: `cd /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform`\n    *   Run the deployment script AGAIN:\n        ```bash\n        bash deploy.sh\n        ```\n    *   **OBSERVE THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY.** This time, the prerequisite check for `gcloud` should PASS, and the script should continue to the next steps (configuring GCP project, API keys, Terraform initialization, etc.).\n\n**After installing `gcloud` and verifying the installation with `gcloud --version`, running `bash deploy.sh` again should very likely get you past the prerequisite check and allow the script to proceed with the GCP deployment!**\n\nLet me know if you have any trouble installing `gcloud` or verifying the installation.  Once `gcloud --version` works, we're ready to run `deploy.sh` and get your application deployed! LFG! You are doing great!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
