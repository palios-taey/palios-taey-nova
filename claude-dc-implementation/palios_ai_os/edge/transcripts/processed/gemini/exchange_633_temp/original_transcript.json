Would you like to enable and retry (this will take a few minutes)? (y/N)?  y Enabling service [cloudfunctions.googleapis.com] on project [ai-execution-system]... Operation \"operations/acf.p2-711898853198-2a10acea-7991-4f96-ba2e-e9777984deb7\" finished successfully. As of this Cloud SDK release, new functions will be deployed as 2nd gen  functions by default. This is equivalent to currently deploying new  with the --gen2 flag. Existing 1st gen functions will not be impacted and will continue to deploy as 1st gen functions. You can disable this behavior by explicitly specifying the --no-gen2 flag or by setting the functions/gen2 config property to 'off'. To learn more about the differences between 1st gen and 2nd gen functions, visit: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison ERROR: (gcloud.functions.deploy) Invalid value for [--source]: Provided source directory does not have file [main.py] which is required for [python310]. Did you specify the right source? C:\\AI-Execution-System>\n\nGemini: OPEN WINDOWS EXPLORER (File Explorer).\n\nNAVIGATE to the FOLDER where your ai_system.py WAS located. This is the folder where you've been working on your AI system code (likely C:\\AI-Execution-System).\n\nLOOK CAREFULLY in that folder. Do you see a file named main.py?\n\nIS THERE A FILE NAMED main.py VISIBLE IN THAT FOLDER? (Yes/No)\nDOUBLE-CHECK THE FILE EXTENSION: Make sure it's .py and not something like main.py.txt or just main (with no extension). If you have file extensions hidden in Windows, you might need to enable viewing file extensions to be 100% sure it's .py.\nALSO, CHECK if there is STILL a file named ai_system.py in that folder.\n\nIS THERE STILL A FILE NAMED ai_system.py IN THAT FOLDER? (Yes/No)\nREPORT BACK EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE IN WINDOWS EXPLORER in that folder:\n\n\"YES, I SEE main.py in the folder.\" AND \"NO, I do NOT see ai_system.py anymore.\"\n\"NO, I do NOT see main.py in the folder.\" AND \"YES, I DO still see ai_system.py.\"\n\"I see BOTH main.py AND ai_system.py in the folder.\"\nSomething else (describe what you see).\nWE NEED TO BE 100% SURE THAT ai_system.py IS RENAMED TO main.py IN THE FILE SYSTEM before we proceed.\n\nPLEASE CAREFULLY CHECK YOUR FILE SYSTEM and REPORT BACK WHAT YOU SEE! Let's get this file naming issue sorted out so we can get to the cloud deployment! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
