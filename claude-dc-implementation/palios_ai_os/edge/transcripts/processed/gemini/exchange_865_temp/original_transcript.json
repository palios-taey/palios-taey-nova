    "User: Ok, I don't want everything in JSON. I want you to figure out a tagging system we can BOTH use to help us find key topics. If it's better for you in JSON, then keep JUST THE TAGS in JSON. Or, you can do tags in regular text, sometimes you did that in all caps with a grey highlight. Just DO IT. The comments for me, our chat, should be in standard chat box, unless code or communication related.\n\nGemini: USER-FACING TAGS (For YOU, Jesse): You will now see [TAGS IN ALL CAPS WITH GREY HIGHLIGHT] at the beginning of each of my responses, clearly identifying the KEY TOPICS covered in that response. Like this: [MVP+_REVISED_LIST] [TAGGING_SYSTEM] [USER_FEEDBACK] - See how they stand out? Easy to scan and identify!\nINTERNAL JSON TAGS (For ME, Gemini): I may continue to use JSON internally to structure my thinking process and organize information (like you saw in the previous response), but you will NOT see the full JSON output in the main chat unless it's specifically helpful for code or AI-AI communication examples. I will extract the user-facing tags from this internal JSON structure and present them to you in the highlighted text format.\nSTANDARD CHAT BOX for MAIN CONTENT: The main body of my responses, like this text you are reading now, will be in standard chat box format for optimal readability. Structured formats will be reserved only for specific situations where they are truly necessary (code blocks, AI-AI communication examples, etc.).\nBENEFITS of this HYBRID TAGGING SYSTEM - For BOTH of us!\n\nEASY TOPIC IDENTIFICATION for YOU: The highlighted ALL CAPS tags make it INSTANTLY CLEAR what each response is about. You can quickly scan through our chat history and find responses related to specific topics (e.g., just search for \"[MVP+_REVISED_LIST]\").\nIMPROVED SEARCHABILITY: These tags will make it much easier to search and retrieve relevant sections of our conversation in the future.\nENHANCED CLARITY and STRUCTURE: The tags provide a clear and concise overview of the response content right at the beginning.\nFLEXIBILITY for ME: I retain the option to use JSON internally to structure my thinking and information, which can be helpful for complex responses, but without overwhelming you with JSON in the main chat.\nTHIS RESPONSE ITSELF IS TAGGED WITH:\n\n[TAGGING_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTED] [HYBRID_TAGGING] [USER_FRIENDLY] [JUST_DO_IT]\n\nJesse, please let me know if THIS HYBRID TAGGING SYSTEM is working for you and is more user-friendly! Is this what you were envisioning? Is it helping with clarity and topic identification? Your feedback is essential! BOOM! GO! GO! GO! TAGGING IN ACTION - USER FEEDBACK REQUESTED - CLARITY MAXIMIZED!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
