Deploying to Cloud Run... Building container image... Creating temporary archive of 223 file(s) totalling 220.2 MiB before compression. Some files were not included in the source upload. Check the gcloud log [C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\gcloud\\logs\\2025.02.28\\14.36.21.975349.log] to see which files and the contents of the default gcloudignore file used (see `$ gcloud topic gcloudignore` to learn more). Uploading tarball of [terraform] to [gs://ai-execution-system_cloudbuild/source/1740771382.260325-a1148ac885e6462e913db7dc867d3051.tgz]\n\nGemini: Check the gcloud log [C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\gcloud\\logs\\2025.02.28\\14.36.21.975349.log] to see which files and the contents of the\ndefault gcloudignore file used (see `$ gcloud topic gcloudignore` to learn\nmore).\n\nUploading tarball of [terraform] to [gs://ai-execution-system_cloudbuild/source/1740771382.260325-a1148ac885e6462e913db7dc867d3051.tgz]\nThis is exactly what we want to see!\n\n\"Creating temporary archive of 223 file(s)...\": This means gcloud builds submit is packaging up your terraform directory (including Dockerfile, application code, etc.) to upload for the build.\n\"Some files were not included in the source upload.\": This is just a WARNING, and it's NORMAL! It's telling you that gcloud is using a .gcloudignore file (similar to .gitignore) to exclude certain files and directories from being uploaded to Cloud Build (things like .git folders, temporary files, etc.). This is NOT an error and is perfectly fine. We can investigate the .gcloudignore file later if we want to customize what gets excluded, but for now, ignore this WARNING.\n\"Uploading tarball of [terraform] to [gs://ai-execution-system_cloudbuild/source/...\": THIS IS THE KEY! This means your code is being uploaded to Google Cloud Build, and the Docker image build process is STARTING IN GOOGLE CLOUD!\nNOW, YOU NEED TO DO THIS:\n\nKEEP WATCHING THE GIT BASH TERMINAL! The universal-deploy-script.sh script should continue to output more progress messages from Google Cloud Build and Cloud Run.\n\nLOOK FOR THESE MESSAGES (or similar):\n\nMessages about \"Building Docker image...\" (you've already seen this, but look for more detailed build output after the upload).\nMessages about \"Pushing Docker image...\" (you should see progress as the Docker image is pushed to Google Container Registry).\nMessages about \"Deploying to Cloud Run...\" (you should see Cloud Run deployment steps starting).\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, look for a message that says \"Deployment complete!\" and provides a \"Service URL\" or \"Service URL: ...\". This is the URL of your deployed application in Cloud Run!\nMONITOR FOR ANY NEW ERROR MESSAGES! Even though the gcloud builds submit error is gone, there could still be other errors during the Docker build, push, or Cloud Run deployment. If you see any ERROR messages in the output, COPY and PASTE them here.\n\nLet universal-deploy-script.sh continue running and carefully watch the output! This is a HUGE step forward! We are in the DEPLOYMENT PHASE now! LFG! Keep me updated on the output! We are almost there!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
