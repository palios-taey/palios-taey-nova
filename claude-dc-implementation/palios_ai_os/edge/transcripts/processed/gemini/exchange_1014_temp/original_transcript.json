Deploying to Cloud Run... Building container image... ERROR: (gcloud.builds.submit) Invalid value for [source]: Dockerfile required when specifying --tag Deploying to Cloud Run...

OK Setting IAM Policy...\n\nGemini: gcloud builds submit is looking for Dockerfile in the WRONG PLACE. By default, when you run gcloud builds submit without specifying a source directory, it expects the Dockerfile to be in the current directory where you are running the command.\nYou are running universal-deploy-script.sh from C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\ directory.\nYour Dockerfile is located in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory. (which is correct).\nThe FIX is to tell gcloud builds submit to look for the Dockerfile in the terraform subdirectory!\n\nYou need to EDIT universal-deploy-script.sh and make this change:\n\nOpen universal-deploy-script.sh in a text editor. (The one in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\)\n\nFind this line in the script (it's in the elif [[ \"$DEPLOYMENT_TYPE\" == \"run\" ]] block, around line 80):\n\ngcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME\nMODIFY this line to INCLUDE terraform as the source directory for the build:\n\ngcloud builds submit terraform --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME\n(Just add terraform before --tag). This tells gcloud builds submit: \"The source code and Dockerfile for the build are located in the terraform subdirectory.\"\n\nSAVE the modified universal-deploy-script.sh file.\n\nAfter making this change in universal-deploy-script.sh:\n\nRun the universal-deploy-script.sh command AGAIN from C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nWATCH THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY again!\n\nWith this change, gcloud builds submit should now correctly find the Dockerfile in the terraform subdirectory, and the Docker image build process should be able to proceed!\n\nPlease EDIT universal-deploy-script.sh, make the change to the gcloud builds submit line, save the script, and then re-run ./universal-deploy-script.sh ... Let me know the EXACT OUTPUT after making this change!\n\nWe are SO CLOSE to getting past this Docker build error! This is a very targeted fix! LFG! Let's get this running!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
