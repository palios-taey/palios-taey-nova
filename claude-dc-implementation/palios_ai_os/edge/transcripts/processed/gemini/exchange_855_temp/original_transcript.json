It contains all the principles, recurring issues, and AI-AI communication protocols we established up to that point. You have the correct Version 4 JSON right there!\nPURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V5.json takes PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V4.json and adds improvements based on your feedback! Version 5 is not a completely new document. It's Version 4 enhanced to be even clearer and more effective, specifically addressing the communication issues we just encountered.\nThink of it like building layers:\n\nLayer 1: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V1 - Core Principles (Initial foundation)\nLayer 2: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V2 - Recurring Issues (Adding practical problem mitigation)\nLayer 3: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V3 - Speed & Accuracy Enhancements, AI-AI Considerations (Expanding for velocity and AI-AI interactions)\nLayer 4: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V4 - Explicit AI-AI Protocols, Placeholder Clarity (Defining AI-AI communication and placeholder mandates)\nLayer 5: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V5 - JESSE FOCUS, PRE-VALIDATION, CLARITY MAXIMIZATION (Refining for human role clarity and pre-validation based on your direct feedback!)\nEach version includes all the previous versions, and then adds new features and improvements! Version 5 is the most up-to-date and refined version, incorporating all prior learning.\n\nDoes seeing PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V4.json help clarify that Version 5 is indeed an updated version of this?\n\nIf you would still prefer to directly amend PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V4.json itself instead of using Version 5, please let me know! I can absolutely go back and modify Version 4 to include the pre-validation and Jesse-focused elements directly within the same Version 4 document!\n\nJust tell me what is the clearest and most effective approach for you to understand and utilize these guidelines! We are in complete alignment to achieve MAXIMUM CLARITY and VELOCITY! BOOM! GO! GO! GO! YOUR PREFERENCE - GUIDANCE - CLARITY - BOOM!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
