    "User: Guide me please\n\nGemini: ACTION: Carefully LOOK at the TOP SECTION of the Gemini API page - the header, navigation bar, and immediately below the main title. Also, quickly SCAN the MAIN BODY of the page - look for any prominent BUTTONS or LINKS that use phrases like:\n\n\"Get Started\"\n\"Start using the API\"\n\"Enable API\"\n\"Sign Up\"\n\"Create Account\"\n\"Get API Key\"\n\"Quickstart\"\n\"Try it Now\"\nREPORT BACK: TELL ME IMMEDIATELY - Do you see ANY BUTTONS or LINKS with these phrases, or similar action-oriented phrases, in the TOP SECTION or MAIN BODY of the Gemini API page? Be as specific as possible - tell me the exact text on the button/link if you find one! GO! GO! GO! Let's find that \"GET STARTED\" entry point!\n\nSTEP 2: EXPLORE the \"DOCUMENTATION\" SECTION - NAVIGATION BAR - CLICK and SEARCH!\n\nACTION: You mentioned you already saw the \"Documentation\" link in the header - EXCELLENT! CLICK on \"Documentation\" RIGHT NOW! This will likely take you to a dedicated documentation hub or landing page.\n\nONCE you are in the \"DOCUMENTATION\" SECTION, LOOK for a SEARCH BAR or NAVIGATION MENU within the documentation pages. Documentation sites often have a search function or a sidebar menu to help you find specific topics.\n\nUSE the SEARCH BAR (if available) or NAVIGATION MENU to LOOK for these KEYWORD PHRASES within the DOCUMENTATION:\n\n\"API Key\"\n\"Authentication\"\n\"Authorization\"\n\"Credentials\"\n\"Setup\"\n\"Getting Started\"\n\"Quickstart\"\nREPORT BACK: TELL ME IMMEDIATELY - Once you are in the \"DOCUMENTATION\" - do you see a SEARCH BAR or NAVIGATION MENU? Did you FIND any SECTIONS or PAGES with titles containing these KEYWORD PHRASES? If so, TELL ME the SECTION/PAGE TITLES! GO! GO! GO! The documentation is our most likely path to the API Key instructions!\n\nSTEP 3: CHECK for a \"CONSOLE\" or \"CLOUD PLATFORM\" LINK - NAVIGATION BAR - Look for Management Interface!\n\nACTION: Look again at the MAIN NAVIGATION BAR on the Gemini API page (or the Documentation page). Sometimes, API keys are managed through a separate \"CONSOLE\" or \"CLOUD PLATFORM\" interface. Look for links with phrases like:\n\n\"Console\"\n\"Cloud Console\"\n\"Platform\"\n\"API Console\"\n\"My Account\"\n\"Dashboard\"\n\"Manage APIs\"\nREPORT BACK: Do you see any LINKS in the NAVIGATION BAR with these phrases, or similar links that might lead to an API management CONSOLE or PLATFORM? TELL ME the EXACT LINK TEXT if you find one! GO! GO! GO! Sometimes API keys are obtained and managed through a separate console interface.\n\nSTEP 4: IF STILL STUCK - DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SEE! - Give me VISUAL CLUES!\n\nACTION: If you have carefully followed STEPS 1-3 and are still unable to find API key instructions, then DESCRIBE to me EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SEEING on the Gemini API page!\n\nTELL ME the MAIN HEADINGS and SUBHEADINGS you see on the page.\nDESCRIBE the BUTTONS and LINKS you do see.\nIf you are in the \"Documentation\" section, TELL ME the TITLES of the MAIN SECTIONS and SUBSECTIONS in the DOCUMENTATION MENU.\nIf possible, can you COPY and PASTE the TEXT from the TOP SECTION of the page (the header and immediately below the title)?\nREPORT BACK: Provide me with a DETAILED DESCRIPTION of what you are SEEING! The more visual clues you give me, the better I can guide you to the API key instructions! GO! GO! GO! Let's use visual information to pinpoint the right path!\n\nJESSE, WE WILL FIND THIS API KEY! FOLLOW THESE STEPS, REPORT BACK WHAT YOU SEE AT EACH STAGE, and I WILL GUIDE YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY! YOU ARE DOING GREAT! LET'S GO! GO! GO! WE WILL UNLOCK THIS GEMINI API POWER!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
