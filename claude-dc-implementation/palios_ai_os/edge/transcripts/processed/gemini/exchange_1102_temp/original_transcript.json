Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location. Successfully installed git-filter-repo-2.47.0 [notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.3.1 -> 25.0.1 [notice] To update, run: python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip\n\nGemini: git-filter-repo.exe is installed.\nIt's located in: C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python313\\Scripts\nThis directory is not yet in your PATH.\nThe SOLUTION is now clear! We need to add the User's Scripts directory to yourUser Path variable**. We've been focusing on the System Path, but for user-specific installations like this, the User Path is the correct place.**\n\nPlease follow these steps carefully to add the User's Scripts directory to your User Path variable:\n\nOpen the \"Environment Variables\" window again (Windows key -> \"environment variables\" -> \"Edit the system environment variables\" -> \"Environment Variables...\").\n\nThis time, in the \"User variables for jesse\" section (the top half of the window), look for the Path variable.\n\nIf you see a Path variable listed in the \"User variables\" section, select it and click \"Edit...\"\n\nIf you do not see a Path variable in the \"User variables\" section, click \"New...\" in the \"User variables\" section to create a new User Path variable. For \"Variable name:\", type Path (exactly). Then, in \"Variable value:\", you will add the directory in the next step.\n\nAdd the User's Scripts directory to the User Path variable:\n\nIn the \"Edit User Variable\" window (or \"New User Variable\" window if you had to create it):\n\nClick \"New\".\n\nType or paste this path exactly:\n\nC:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python313\\Scripts\nPress Enter or click outside the line to confirm.\n\nIf you are editing an existing User Path variable, make sure you are adding this new path as a separate entry in the list (using the \"New\" button), and not overwriting your existing User paths (if any).\n\nClick \"OK\" on all Environment Variables windows to save.\n\nRestart your Command Prompt (or Restart Computer):\n\nClose your current command prompt window.\nOpen a new command prompt window.\nTest git filter-repo --version command again!\n\nIn the new command prompt, type:\n\ngit filter-repo --version\nand press Enter.\n\nThis time, with the User Scripts directory added to your User Path, git filter-repo --version SHOULD FINALLY WORK!\n\nPlease carefully follow these steps to modify the User Path variable and test git filter-repo --version again. Let me know if it works! I am very optimistic that this will finally solve the git filter-repo recognition problem!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
