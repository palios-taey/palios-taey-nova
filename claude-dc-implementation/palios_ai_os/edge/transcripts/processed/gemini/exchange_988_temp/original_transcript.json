[ERROR] terraform is required but not installed. Please install it and try again.\n\nGemini: Let's fix this NOW by explicitly adding the Terraform directory to Git Bash's PATH, just like we did for gcloud's Python.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nRemember the Terraform Executable Directory: You previously confirmed that you placed terraform.exe in C:\\terraform\\ directory.\n\nUpdate Git Bash PATH to include Terraform Directory:\n\nOpen Git Bash (if it's not already open).\n\nIn the Git Bash terminal, run the following command to add C:\\terraform\\ to the PATH within Git Bash:\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/c/terraform\"\nExplanation: This command is similar to what we did for gcloud's Python. It adds /c/terraform (which corresponds to C:\\terraform\\ on Windows) to the existing PATH environment variable specifically for the current Git Bash session.\nVERIFY Terraform Installation in Git Bash (AFTER updating PATH):\n\nIMMEDIATELY after running the export PATH=\"$PATH:/c/terraform\" command in Git Bash, run:\n\nterraform --version\nEXPECTED RESULT: This time, terraform --version MUST WORK in Git Bash! It should output the Terraform version information without any \"'terraform' is not recognized...\" error. This confirms that Git Bash can now find the terraform executable.\n\nImportant:\n\nRun export PATH and terraform --version in the SAME Git Bash terminal session. The export PATH command only affects the current Git Bash session.\nIf terraform --version still fails in Git Bash after export PATH: Double-check:\nYou typed the export PATH command correctly, especially the path /c/terraform.\nterraform.exe is definitely located in C:\\terraform\\ folder.\nYou are running terraform --version in the same Git Bash terminal where you ran export PATH.\nOnce terraform --version is working CORRECTLY in Git Bash, then you have successfully made Terraform accessible within the Git Bash environment!\n\nAfter verifying terraform --version in Git Bash, your NEXT step will be to run the deployment script AGAIN in Git Bash:\n\nbash deploy.sh\nLet me know as soon as you have updated the PATH for Terraform in Git Bash and verified terraform --version is working there! If terraform --version works in Git Bash, then running bash deploy.sh should now finally pass the Terraform prerequisite check and move forward with the deployment! LFG! We are incredibly close now!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
