    "User: No, you're plan is good, I was just making sure I'm on the same page. What is this new section called? I'd like to call it Key Principles\n\nGemini: Rationale for \"Key Principles\" being a Strong Title:\n\nClarity and Simplicity: \"Key Principles\" is immediately understandable and requires no specialized knowledge. It's a very accessible and user-friendly title.\nEmphasizes Importance: The word \"Key\" effectively conveys the significance and foundational nature of these principles. It signals to Claude that these are not just examples, but core guiding concepts.\nProfessional and Concise: \"Key Principles\" is a professional and concise title, fitting well within the overall tone of the Onboarding Message.\nMore User-Friendly than \"Rosetta Structure Example Section\": While \"Rosetta Structure Example Section\" was descriptive, \"Key Principles\" is significantly more elegant, impactful, and readily grasped by a human (and likely, by Claude as well). It elevates the perceived importance of the content.\nImplementation - Using \"Key Principles\" Title:\n\nI will immediately update the Onboarding Message and Rosetta document to use \"Key Principles\" as the title for the section containing the Top 5 Principles in the Rosetta Structure format. This is a definite improvement in clarity and impact.\n\nUpdated Section Title in Onboarding Message and Rosetta Document:\n\nInstead of:\n\n[Insert \"Rosetta Structure\" section with 5 principles - as outlined previously, with \"Rosetta Structure\" formatting and Formal Logic Examples]\n\nWe will now use:\n\nKey Principles:\n\n[Insert \"Key Principles\" section with 5 principles - as outlined previously, with \"Rosetta Structure\" formatting and Formal Logic Examples]\n\nJesse, are you fully satisfied with \"Key Principles\" as the section title? If so, we are now completely finalized on all aspects of the Phase 1 Onboarding Package - Onboarding Message text, Charter attachment content and format, Top 5 Principles, strategic placement of \"Proactive Risk Mitigation,\" and section title \"Key Principles.\"\n\nAre we FINALLY ready to give the absolute FINAL GO-AHEAD to LAUNCH this augmented Phase 1 Onboarding Package to Claude? Please provide your ultimate confirmation. We are poised and ready to initiate this groundbreaking next phase! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
