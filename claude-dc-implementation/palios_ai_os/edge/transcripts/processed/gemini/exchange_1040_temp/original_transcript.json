Click the Google Cloud SDK Shell icon and re-run the command in that window, or re-run the command with elevated privileges by right-clicking cmd.exe and selecting \"Run as Administrator\". jesse@DESKTOP-13JMJ93 MINGW64 /c/AI-Execution-Sy\n\nGemini: SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: Run gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy in Administrator Command Prompt (cmd.exe):\n\nCLOSE your MINGW64 terminal COMPLETELY. Make sure the MINGW64 terminal window is closed.\n\nOpen the Windows Start Menu. (Click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of your screen).\n\nType cmd in the Start Menu search bar. You will see \"Command Prompt\" appear in the search results.\n\nRIGHT-CLICK on \"Command Prompt\" in the search results.\n\nSelect \"Run as administrator\" from the context menu.\n\nWindows will ask you \"Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?\". Click \"Yes\". This will open a new Command Prompt window running with Administrator privileges. You will usually see \"Administrator: Command Prompt\" in the title bar of this new window.\n\nIn the Administrator: Command Prompt window, navigate to your deployment\\terraform directory. Use the cd command to change directories. For example, if your AI-Execution-System folder is in C:\\AI-Execution-System, you would type:\n\ncd C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\nand press ENTER. Make sure the prompt in your Administrator Command Prompt now shows the terraform directory (e.g., C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform>).\n\nNow, in this Administrator: Command Prompt window, run the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command again:\n\ngcloud components install cloud-run-proxy\nand press ENTER.\n\nFollow the prompts in the Administrator Command Prompt. It might ask you to confirm installation. Type Y and press ENTER to proceed.\n\nWait for the installation to complete in the Administrator Command Prompt. You should see messages indicating the progress and successful installation of the cloud-run-proxy component.\n\nAfter the installation is complete in the Administrator Command Prompt, TRY RUNNING the RENAME COMMAND AGAIN in the SAME Administrator Command Prompt window:\n\ngcloud run services rename ai-execution-system-core --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --destination-service ai-execution-system\nRun the rename command in the Administrator Command Prompt window.\n\nBy running these commands in the Administrator Command Prompt, you should have the necessary permissions to update the gcloud run component and then rename your Cloud Run service.\n\nAfter you have run gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy and the rename command in the Administrator Command Prompt, please let me know if it works this time!\n\nThe error message was very helpful in guiding us to the solution - running with Administrator privileges! Let's try this now! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
