    "User: Ok, it is stuck again. C:\\AI-Execution-System>python ai_system.py \u2705 Serving health check on port 8080... DEBUG: Health check message printed. Proceeding to next steps... DEBUG: Paused for 5 seconds. Checking if script continues... DEBUG: Attempting to initialize core AI system components...\n\nGemini: \"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\": This message confirms that the health check server has STARTED SUCCESSFULLY. This part is working perfectly!\n\"DEBUG: Health check message printed. Proceeding to next steps...\"\n\"DEBUG: Paused for 5 seconds. Checking if script continues...\"\n\"DEBUG: Attempting to initialize core AI system components...\": These debug messages are a bit misleading. They make it sound like more initialization is coming after this point, but that's not quite accurate.\nHERE'S THE CRITICAL POINT: httpd.serve_forever() IS A BLOCKING FUNCTION!\n\nWhen the script reaches the line httpd.serve_forever(), it does exactly what it says: it starts the server and then waits FOREVER for incoming health check requests.\nThe script is designed to PAUSE at httpd.serve_forever() and run in the BACKGROUND as a health check server. It's NOT supposed to proceed further in the same terminal session.\nIt's NOT stuck in an error. It's actually running CORRECTLY as a server!\nThink of it like this: You've started a web server. A web server doesn't just run once and finish. It starts, and then it waits in the background, listening for requests. That's exactly what ai_system.py is doing right now \u2013 it's running a very simple health check server and waiting for requests on port 8080.\n\nTO CONFIRM IT'S WORKING AS A HEALTH CHECK SERVER:\n\nLEAVE the ai_system.py script RUNNING in your terminal. Don't stop it.\nOPEN a NEW web browser window (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\nIn the browser's address bar, type in: http://localhost:8080/health and press ENTER.\nIf the health check server is running correctly (which it looks like it is), you should see this in your web browser:\n\n{\"status\": \"healthy\"}\nAnd, if you look back at the terminal where you ran python ai_system.py, you might see some output like this (though it might be very minimal): (This depends on how your system logs HTTP requests)\n\n127.0.0.1 - - [25/Feb/2025 16:30:00] \"GET /health HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nThis would confirm that the health check server is running, receiving requests, and responding correctly!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nNow that we know ai_system.py is running as a health check server (and likely initialized the core AI system components when it started), what do you want to do NEXT?\n\nWere you expecting ai_system.py to do something more than just run a health check server?\nWere you expecting to be able to create tasks and execute them directly from running ai_system.py?\nLet me know what you want to achieve next, and I can guide you on how to proceed. We might need to create another script to interact with the AISystem that's running in the background (the health check server).\n\nFor now, PLEASE TRY the HEALTH CHECK TEST in your web browser (http://localhost:8080/health) and let me know if you see {\"status\": \"healthy\"} in your browser! This will confirm that ai_system.py is indeed working as a health check server!\n\nEXCELLENT progress, Jesse! We got past all the syntax errors! Let's confirm the health check and then decide on the next steps! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
