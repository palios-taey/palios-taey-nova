This makes the script more robust regardless of the working directory from which it's run, as long as the charter_sections folder is indeed in the same directory as the script.\ntry...except FileNotFoundError block: Wrapped the os.listdir() call in a try...except block to gracefully handle the case where the charter_sections folder is not found at the expected path.\nLogging and Console Output for Folder Not Found: If FileNotFoundError occurs:\nA detailed ERROR log event is generated using PaliosLogger, including the full folder path that was not found.\nAn informative error message is printed to the console, also including the full folder path.\nThe upload_charter_sections() function returns, preventing the script from proceeding further if the folder is missing.\nNext Steps for You, Jesse (Immediate):\n\nReplace firestore_upload_script.py Content: Completely replace the content of your existing firestore_upload_script.py file with the entire code block of Version 7 provided above.\n\nVerify charter_sections Folder Location: Double-check that your charter_sections folder is indeed located in the same directory as your firestore_upload_script.py file. If it's not, you have two options:\n\nOption A (Recommended): Move the charter_sections folder to be in the same directory as firestore_upload_script.py. This is the simplest and default assumption of the script.\nOption B (Advanced): Modify the charter_folder variable in the script to point to the actual path of your charter_sections folder if it's located elsewhere. For example, if it's in C:/Data/CharterSections, you would change:\ncharter_folder = \"C:/Data/CharterSections\" #  <-  Full path to your charter_sections folder\nIf you choose Option B, use forward slashes / in the path, even on Windows, for consistency in Python paths.\nRun firestore_upload_script.py: Execute the updated firestore_upload_script.py script again: python firestore_upload_script.py\n\nCheck Console Output: Observe the console output. It should now:\n\nStart with \"Starting Firestore upload script...\"\nIf the charter_sections folder is found correctly, proceed to upload each section and print \"Uploaded section...\" messages.\nIf the charter_sections folder is not found, you should see the error message printed to the console indicating the folder path and instructing you to check the folder location.\nVerify Log Files in logs Folder: Check your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\logs folder, specifically the system_logger.log file. You should see:\n\nevent_type=\"STARTUP\"(Script start)\nIf successful upload: event_type=\"UPLOAD_SUCCESS\" for each section uploaded.\nIf folder not found: event_type=\"ERROR\" with a message indicating the folder was not found and the full path.\nevent_type=\"SHUTDOWN\" (Script completion - even if errors occurred, the script should attempt to log shutdown).\nReport Results - Let me know: Please report back the results after running Version 7. Tell me:\n\nDid it run without FileNotFoundError this time?\nDid it upload the Charter sections to Firestore successfully?\nDid you see log events in the system_logger.log file (especially the STARTUP, UPLOAD_SUCCESS, and SHUTDOWN events)?\nIf you still encounter any errors, please copy and paste the exact error message and console output.\nLet's get this working smoothly now! By correcting the paths and adding robust error handling for the folder, Version 7 should be much more reliable. Looking forward to your results!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
