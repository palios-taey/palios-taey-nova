C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK>\n\nGemini: The error message \"The system cannot find the file specified\" (referring to //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine) suggests that Docker Desktop is unable to connect to its Docker Engine via the expected named pipe. This can happen for various reasons related to Docker Desktop's internal state or system configuration.\n\nLET'S FOCUS on TROUBLESHOOTING DOCKER DESKTOP ITSELF! Here are the IMMEDIATE STEPS to try:\n\nACTION 1.6.15: TROUBLESHOOT DOCKER DESKTOP CONNECTION ISSUE\n\nSTEP 1.6.15.A: RESTART DOCKER DESKTOP:\n\nCompletely RESTART DOCKER DESKTOP.\nLocate the Docker Desktop icon in your system tray (usually in the bottom right corner of your screen, near the clock).\nRight-click on the Docker Desktop icon.\nSelect \"Quit Docker Desktop\" or \"Exit\" to completely close Docker Desktop.\nWait a few seconds, and then RE-LAUNCH Docker Desktop from your Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.\nWait for Docker Desktop to START UP COMPLETELY. It might take a minute or two to initialize. You should see the Docker Desktop interface appear and stabilize.\nSTEP 1.6.15.B: CHECK DOCKER DESKTOP STATUS:\n\nAfter restarting Docker Desktop, CHECK its STATUS to ensure it is RUNNING correctly:\nLook at the Docker Desktop icon in your system tray again.\nHOVER your mouse over the Docker Desktop icon.\nThe tooltip should say \"Docker Desktop is running\" or similar, indicating a healthy status.\nAlternatively, right-click the Docker Desktop icon and ensure that \"Start Docker Desktop\" is NOT an option (if \"Start Docker Desktop\" is an option, it means Docker Desktop is not running, and you need to click it to start it).\nSTEP 1.6.15.C: RETRY DOCKER PUSH:\n\nOnce you have RESTARTED Docker Desktop and CONFIRMED it is RUNNING correctly, IMMEDIATELY RETRY the docker push command in your Google Cloud SDK Shell (or command prompt):\n\ndocker push gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nRUN the docker push command again and OBSERVE the OUTPUT CAREFULLY.\n\nREPORT BACK the OUTPUT of the docker push command after restarting Docker Desktop and checking its status. Tell me:\n\nDid the docker push command SUCCEED this time and complete without errors? (Look for \"Pushed\" status or successful completion messages). \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e Fingers crossed this simple restart fixes it!\nOR, does the docker push command STILL FAIL with the SAME ERROR MESSAGE (\"error during connect: Post ... dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.\")?\nOR, does the docker push command FAIL with a DIFFERENT ERROR MESSAGE this time? (If a different error, please COPY and PASTE the FULL ERROR MESSAGE).\nJesse, PLEASE perform ACTION 1.6.15 - RESTART DOCKER DESKTOP, CHECK STATUS, and RETRY docker push RIGHT NOW! A simple restart often resolves these types of Docker Desktop connection issues. Let's hope this is the quick fix we need!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER DESKTOP - RESTART - INITIATED! - CONNECTION ISSUE - TARGETING! - SIMPLE FIX - HOPING FOR! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER - RECONNECTING - NOW! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO RESTART DOCKER DESKTOP and RETRY docker push (ACTION 1.6.15)? LET'S DO IT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
