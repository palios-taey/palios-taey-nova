    "User: Gemini, come on now. What's next?\n\nGemini: ACTION ITEM: EXECUTE THE curl COMMAND FOR TASK EXECUTION (again, but with a meaningful task description)!\n\nPlease, IMMEDIATELY:\n\nOPEN YOUR TERMINAL WINDOW (if it's not already open).\n\nCOPY AND PASTE this UPDATED curl command EXACTLY into your terminal:\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Research the key technological advancements in AI in the last 5 years and summarize their potential impact on society.\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend\nNotice the CHANGE in this curl command:\n\nThe -d data is now a more meaningful task_description: \"Research the key technological advancements in AI in the last 5 years and summarize their potential impact on society.\" This is a realistic example of a task we might want our AI system to perform in the future!\nThe FUNCTION URL remains the same: https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend (We are using the same endpoint, but sending a POST request with a JSON body to trigger the execute_task function logic within our Cloud Function).\nPRESS ENTER to execute the curl command.\n\nOBSERVE THE TERMINAL OUTPUT. Again, curl will send the HTTP POST request, and we'll see the HTTP response body in the terminal.\n\nWE ARE NOW EXPECTING THE TERMINAL OUTPUT (HTTP response body) to ECHO BACK OUR NEW TASK DESCRIPTION, like this (but with your exact task description):\n\n{\"echoed_task_description\": \"Research the key technological advancements in AI in the last 5 years and summarize their potential impact on society.\", \"status\": \"task_echoed\"}\nTHIS CONFIRMS that our execute_task function can now receive a meaningful task description and echo it back! This is a HUGE step towards actually executing tasks!\n\nPLEASE EXECUTE THIS UPDATED curl COMMAND EXACTLY AS SHOWN AND REPORT BACK WITH THE TERMINAL OUTPUT and whether you see the EXPECTED JSON RESPONSE with your TASK DESCRIPTION echoed back!\n\nLET'S TEST THE execute_task FUNCTION WITH A REAL TASK! GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
