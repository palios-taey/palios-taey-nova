Just like you did for the 'bdcs' folder, you can simply list the names (e.g., vision_section.json, mission_section.json, etc.). This will confirm that we have all the expected section files.\n\nContent of One Charter Section File: Could you please copy and paste the text content of one of the files from the charter subfolder? For example, you could choose the vision_section.json file or any other section file. Please just copy the text from inside the file and paste it directly here in our chat.\n\nTo be clear, I need the actual JSON code from inside one of these *.json files, not just the filename.\nOnce you provide me with the list of filenames from the 'charter' subfolder and the content of one of the Charter section files, I will be able to:\n\nConfirm that we have all the necessary Charter section files.\nUnderstand the exact JSON structure Claude used for the Charter data.\nUpdate the firestore_upload_script.py script to correctly process and upload this Charter data to Firestore.\nAfter we get the Charter data correctly uploaded, we will then move on to examining the 'bdcs' files and figuring out how to integrate them into our PALIOS-TAEY system.\n\nThank you again for your patience and excellent organization! Please provide the filenames for the 'charter' folder and the content of one of the Charter section files, and we will get the Charter data upload corrected right away!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
