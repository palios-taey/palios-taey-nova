    "User: Welcome to Node.js v22.14.0. Type \".help\" for more information. > node -v Uncaught ReferenceError: node is not defined >\n\nGemini: Jesse, I see the error! My apologies \u2013 my setup instructions were partially clear, but missed a CRITICAL detail! The node -v and npm -v commands should NOT be run within the Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).\n\nYou are currently inside the Node.js REPL. You entered the REPL by typing node in your command prompt/terminal \u2013 which is correct for starting the REPL, but not for running system commands like node -v.\n\nTo verify Node.js and npm versions, you need to run those commands in your REGULAR COMMAND PROMPT or TERMINAL - BEFORE you type node to enter the REPL.\n\nCorrected Instructions - Verifying Node.js and npm Installation:\n\nClose the Node.js REPL. You are currently inside the Node.js REPL, indicated by the > prompt. To exit the REPL, type .exit and press Enter. You should return to your regular command prompt or terminal prompt (e.g., C:\\Users\\YourName> on Windows, or username@computername:~$ on Mac/Linux).\n\nRun version verification commands in the COMMAND PROMPT/TERMINAL (OUTSIDE the REPL):\n\nIn your COMMAND PROMPT or TERMINAL (NOT the Node.js REPL prompt >), type the following commands and press Enter after each:\n\nnode -v\nnpm -v\nYou should see the version numbers printed directly in your command prompt/terminal, not within the Node.js REPL. For example:\n\nC:\\Users\\YourName>node -v\nv20.x.x  (or whatever version you installed)\n\nC:\\Users\\YourName>npm -v\n10.x.x (or whatever npm version is installed)\nTo Summarize - Run node -v and npm -v in your COMMAND PROMPT/TERMINAL - BEFORE you type node to start the REPL.\n\nApologies for the lack of clarity in my initial instructions! This is a crucial detail, and I will ensure future instructions are even more precise to prevent this confusion.\n\nPlease try these corrected steps, Jesse. Close the Node.js REPL (.exit), then run node -v and npm -v directly in your command prompt or terminal. This should correctly verify your Node.js and npm installations.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or encounter any issues! We will get this TypeScript environment BOOMING for you! LFG! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf89\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
