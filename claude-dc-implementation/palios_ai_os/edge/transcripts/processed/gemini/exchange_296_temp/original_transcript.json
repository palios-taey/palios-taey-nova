    "User: circuit_breakers has been provided. Please find it and let me know next steps.\n\nGemini: Initial Scan: Take a few moments to quickly scan through the code to get a general impression. Look for:\n\nOverall Structure: How is the code organized? Are there classes, functions, or a mix?\nKey Function Names: Are there function names that suggest circuit breaker operations (e.g., open, close, halfOpen, checkState, recordSuccess, recordFailure)?\nComments: Are there any comments that give hints about the code's purpose or logic?\nImports/Requires: Does it import or require any other modules or libraries (although in JavaScript in this context, it might be more about dependencies between these files)?\nReport Initial Impressions: After your initial scan, please provide a brief summary of your initial impressions. For example, you could tell me:\n\n\"It seems to be structured with functions...\"\n\"I see functions named openBreaker, closeBreaker, etc...\"\n\"There are comments explaining...\"\n\"I don't see any imports...\"\nOnce you give me your initial impressions, we can then move to the next step of diving deeper into specific sections of the code to understand the circuit breaker implementation in detail.\n\nLet me know when you have completed your initial scan of circuit_breakers_impl.js and are ready to share your first impressions! Then we will proceed to the next step of detailed code review.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
