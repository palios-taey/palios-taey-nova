    "User: The Google Cloud CLI is configured and ready to use! * Commands that require authentication will use jesselarose@gmail.com by default * Commands will reference project `ai-execution-system` by default * Compute Engine commands will use region `us-central1` by default * Compute Engine commands will use zone `us-central1-a` by default Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings This gcloud configuration is called [default]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects. Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more. Some things to try next: * Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command. * Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the CLI like arg files and output formatting * Run `gcloud cheat-sheet` to see a roster of go-to `gcloud` commands. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK> Now I do the PATH?\n\nGemini: Here's what to do NOW to update the PATH for gcloud:\n\nIdentify the gcloud Executable Directory:\n\nBased on your command prompt C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK>, it is HIGHLY LIKELY that the gcloud executable (gcloud.cmd) is located in this directory:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin\n\nDouble-check this: Open File Explorer and navigate to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin. Confirm that you see gcloud.cmd inside this bin folder.\n\nAdd the gcloud Directory to your PATH Environment Variable:\n\nFollow these EXACT steps again to edit your PATH:\nOpen the Start Menu and search for \"environment variables\".\n\nSelect \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n\nClick the \"Environment Variables...\" button in the System Properties window.\n\nIn the \"System variables\" section (bottom half), scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable.\n\nSelect \"Path\" and click \"Edit...\".\n\nClick \"New\" and PASTE the FULL DIRECTORY PATH to the gcloud.cmd directory that we identified above:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin\n\nClick \"OK\" on all open windows to save the changes.\n\nVERIFY gcloud Installation (AFTER updating PATH):\n\nCLOSE ALL command prompts and Git Bash terminals. This is important for the PATH changes to take effect.\nOpen a NEW command prompt (or Git Bash terminal).\nRun the command: gcloud --version\nYou MUST see the gcloud version information outputted WITHOUT any \"'gcloud' is not recognized...\" error. This confirms gcloud is now correctly in your PATH.\nOnce gcloud --version is working correctly, then you have successfully added gcloud to your PATH!\n\nAfter verifying gcloud --version, your NEXT step will be to go back to Git Bash, navigate to your Terraform directory, and run bash deploy.sh AGAIN.\n\nLet me know as soon as you have updated the PATH and verified gcloud --version in a new command prompt! We are REALLY close to running the deployment script successfully now! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
