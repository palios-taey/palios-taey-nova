Don't forget TAGS.\n\nGemini: Let's try these Docker Desktop troubleshooting steps:\n\nExplicitly Switch to desktop-linux Context (even though it's already marked as *):\n\nIn Git Bash, run the command:\ndocker context use desktop-linux\nThis command explicitly sets your Docker context to desktop-linux. Even though it's already marked with *, explicitly setting it again can sometimes refresh the connection.\nAfter running docker context use desktop-linux, try running bash deploy.sh again.\nCheck Docker Desktop Settings - \"Resources\" Tab (If Switching Context Doesn't Help):\n\nOpen Docker Desktop settings (usually by right-clicking the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray and choosing \"Settings\" or \"Preferences\").\nGo to the \"Resources\" tab (or similar tab related to resources like \"Advanced\", \"Memory\", \"CPU\").\nEnsure Docker Desktop has sufficient resources allocated:\nMemory: Make sure Docker Desktop is allowed to use a reasonable amount of RAM (e.g., at least 4GB, ideally more if you have it available). Insufficient memory can cause Docker to fail.\nCPU: Ensure Docker Desktop can use a reasonable number of CPUs.\nDisk Image Location/Size: Check the disk image settings and ensure there's enough free disk space on the drive where Docker Desktop stores its virtual disk image. If the disk is full, Docker operations will fail.\nDocker Desktop - \"Troubleshoot\" / \"Reset\" Options (Use with Caution):\n\nIn Docker Desktop Settings, look for a \"Troubleshoot\" or \"Diagnostics\" section. Docker Desktop often has built-in diagnostic tools that can help identify problems. Run these diagnostics if available.\n\"Reset\" Options (Use with CAUTION): Docker Desktop settings might have \"Reset\" options like \"Reset to factory defaults\" or \"Reset Kubernetes cluster\" or \"Reset disk image\". Be very careful with \"Reset\" options! \"Reset to factory defaults\" will reset all your Docker Desktop settings and might delete local Docker images and containers. Only use \"Reset\" options if you are comfortable with potentially losing local Docker data and configurations, and as a last resort if other troubleshooting steps fail. If you try a \"Reset\" option, note exactly which option you chose and what happened.\nCheck Windows Firewall/Antivirus (Less Likely, but Possible):\n\nIn rare cases, overly aggressive Windows Firewall or Antivirus software might interfere with Docker Desktop's network connections or inter-process communication.\nTemporarily try disabling your Windows Firewall or Antivirus (ONLY for testing and if you are comfortable doing so, and remember to re-enable them afterwards). Then re-run bash deploy.sh. If disabling Firewall/Antivirus makes a difference, you might need to configure exceptions in your Firewall/Antivirus for Docker Desktop. However, Firewall/Antivirus interference is less common with Docker Desktop than other issues.\nAfter trying these Docker Desktop troubleshooting steps, please re-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash and let me know if the Docker image build and push errors are resolved.\n\nRemember, we are still postponing addressing the Terraform \"Unsupported argument\" errors until AFTER we get past the Docker issues. Let's focus on getting Docker working first, as that seems to be the current blocker in the deploy.sh script.\n\nLet me know what you try and what the results are! We will get Docker working!
