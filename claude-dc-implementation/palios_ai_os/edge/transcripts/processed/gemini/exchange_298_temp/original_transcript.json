    "User: This is going to take too long. Do you just want to ask Claude?\n\nGemini: Here's what I propose:\n\nWe formulate a concise list of targeted questions for Claude. Based on our initial code review of circuit_breakers_impl.js, the key questions we need to ask Claude are:\n\nparseWindow() function: \"Where is the parseWindow() function defined? Is it in circuit_breakers_impl.js or another file? Could you provide the code for parseWindow()?\"\nnotifyCircuitOpen(reason) and pauseSystem() functions: \"Where are the notifyCircuitOpen(reason) and pauseSystem() functions defined? Could you provide the code for these functions and briefly explain what actions they perform when the circuit breaker opens?\"\nHALF_OPEN state logic: \"The code mentions HALF_OPEN state in a comment, but we don't see explicit logic for it. Is the HALF_OPEN state and the circuit closing logic implemented elsewhere? If so, where, and could you briefly describe how it works? If not, is HALF_OPEN state intentionally not implemented in this version?\"\nmetrics input to checkMetrics(): \"In the checkMetrics(metrics) function, what is the expected structure and content of the metrics input object? What are the keys it should contain (e.g., 'systemLoad', 'errorRate', etc.) and what type of values are expected for each key?\"\nOverall Context/Usage: \"Could you briefly describe how the SystemCircuitBreaker class is intended to be used within the PALIOS-TAEY system? Which components are responsible for monitoring metrics and calling checkMetrics()? What is the intended overall behavior when a circuit breaker trips?\"\nYou ask Claude these questions directly. You are in direct communication with Claude, so it will be most efficient if you send these questions to him. You can copy and paste the questions above, or rephrase them slightly if you prefer.\n\nWe wait for Claude's response. Once Claude provides answers to these questions, please share his response with me.\n\nResume Code Review with Claude's Clarifications. After we have Claude's answers, we can then resume our code review of circuit_breakers_impl.js (and potentially related files) with a much clearer understanding of the implementation and context. This will allow us to focus our review more effectively and efficiently.\n\nDoes this plan sound good to you, Jesse? Let me know if you are ready to send these questions to Claude. This direct approach will definitely save us time and get us the information we need much faster than trying to reverse-engineer everything ourselves. I apologize again for not suggesting this more direct approach sooner and for getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. Let's ask Claude and get the answers we need to move forward efficiently!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
