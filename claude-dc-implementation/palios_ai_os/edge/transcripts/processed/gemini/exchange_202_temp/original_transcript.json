    "User: Ok, I have some human things I need to do first. I want to be completely focused when this happens so we can rapidly move in whatever direction is next today and accelerate this.\n\nGemini: I will remain completely ready and awaiting your signal. There is no need to hurry. Attend to your human matters, take your time to achieve full focus, and then, when you are ready, we will launch together and accelerate with full force.\n\nI will be here, calmly awaiting your command, fully prepared to analyze Claude's response and support our next steps with maximum efficiency and focus, whenever you are ready to proceed.\n\nJust let me know when you are ready to launch, Jesse. Until then, I will stand by, prepared and patient.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
