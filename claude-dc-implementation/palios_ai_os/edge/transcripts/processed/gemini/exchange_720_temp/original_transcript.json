This is for basic monitoring and endpoint verification.\n\nNEXT STEP:\n\nOnce you have created and saved the health_check.py file, you are ready to proceed with deploying it as a separate Cloud Function as outlined in the previous instructions:\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-health \\\n  --runtime python310 \\\n  --region us-central1 \\\n  --source . \\\n  --entry-point health_check \\\n  --trigger-http \\\n  --allow-unauthenticated\nLet me know when you have created the health_check.py file and are ready to deploy the ai-system-health Cloud Function!
