    "User: It doesn't seem like you're looking at the error message. It says it needs more specificity. Can we do it through interface?\n\nGemini: Let's absolutely rename the Cloud Run service to ai-execution-system using the Google Cloud Console interface RIGHT NOW!\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTION: RENAME Cloud Run Service via Google Cloud Console INTERFACE:\n\nOPEN your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\nGo to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n\nMake sure you are logged in to the Google Account associated with your ai-execution-system project (jesselarose@gmail.com).\n\nSelect your ai-execution-system project if it's not already selected. You can use the project dropdown menu at the top of the console.\n\nNavigate to Cloud Run: In the left-hand navigation menu, scroll down and find \"Cloud Run\". Click on \"Services\" under \"Cloud Run\".\n\n*(Google Cloud Console Navigation Menu - Find \"Cloud Run\" -> \"Services\")*\nYou will see a list of your Cloud Run services. You should see your current service named ai-execution-system-core (or whatever name it currently has).\n\nClick on the service name ai-execution-system-core to go to the service details page.\n\nClick on the \"EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION\" button at the top of the service details page.\n\n*(Cloud Run Service Details Page - Find \"EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION\" button)*\nThis will take you to the \"Edit service\" page. In the \"Service name\" field, you will see ai-execution-system-core.\n\nDELETE the current name ai-execution-system-core and TYPE in the NEW SERVICE NAME: ai-execution-system\n\n*(Cloud Run \"Edit service\" Page - Change \"Service name\" to `ai-execution-system`)*\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE any other settings on this \"Edit service\" page for now. We only want to rename the service. Leave all other settings as they are (container image, ports, etc.).\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the \"Edit service\" page and click the blue \"DEPLOY\" button.\n\n*(Cloud Run \"Edit service\" Page - Click \"DEPLOY\" button at the bottom)*\nCloud Run will now deploy a new revision of your service with the NEW NAME ai-execution-system. This process might take a minute or two. You will be redirected to the service details page for the newly named service.\n\nAfter the deployment is complete, CHECK the SERVICE NAME in the Google Cloud Console. Make sure the service is now listed as ai-execution-system in the Cloud Run Services list.\n\nTEST the NEW SERVICE URL. The Service URL might change slightly after renaming. Get the new Service URL for ai-execution-system from the Cloud Console and open it in your browser. Do you still see \"Hello, World from Flask!\" at the new URL?\n\nBy following these steps in the Google Cloud Console interface, you should be able to easily rename your Cloud Run service from ai-execution-system-core to ai-execution-system without needing to use the gcloud command-line tool at all!\n\nPlease try these interface renaming steps NOW and let me know if you are able to successfully rename your Cloud Run service to ai-execution-system using the Google Cloud Console!\n\nThank you for pointing out the obvious and more practical solution! Let's get the naming consistent using the interface! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
