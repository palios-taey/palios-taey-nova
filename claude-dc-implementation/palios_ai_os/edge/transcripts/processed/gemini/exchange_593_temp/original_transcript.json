    "User: Ok! It is hung up: C:\\AI-Execution-System>python ai_system.py \u2705 Serving health check on port 8080... The cursor is just flashing below that. It probably can't find the port for health that you put in that Claude mentioned\n\nGemini: LET'S DEBUG ai_system.py to CONFIRM if the HEALTH CHECK PORT is the PROBLEM and to get more information about what's happening!\n\nACTION 1.6.84: MODIFY ai_system.py to ADD DEBUG PRINT STATEMENTS - STEP-BY-STEP!\n\nWe will add some simple print() statements to your ai_system.py Python script to help us understand exactly where it's getting stuck after printing \"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\". Please follow these steps CAREFULLY to modify ai_system.py:\n\nOPEN ai_system.py in your CODE EDITOR. Navigate to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai_system.py and open this file in your code editor (VS Code, etc.).\n\nLOCATE the LINE that PRINTS \"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\". Find the line of code in ai_system.py that looks something like this (it might be slightly different, but look for the line that prints this message):\n\nprint(f\"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\")\nThis is the line of code that is printing the message in your terminal before it hangs.\n\nADD DEBUG PRINT STATEMENTS AFTER the Health Check Print Line. IMMEDIATELY below the line you found in STEP 2, add the following lines of Python code:\n\nprint(\"DEBUG: Health check message printed. Proceeding to next steps...\")  # DEBUG PRINT 1\nimport time  # Import the 'time' module (if not already imported at the top)\ntime.sleep(5)  # Pause for 5 seconds - DEBUG - to see if we reach this point\nprint(\"DEBUG: Paused for 5 seconds. Checking if script continues...\")  # DEBUG PRINT 2\nprint(\"DEBUG: Attempting to initialize core AI system components...\") # DEBUG PRINT 3\n# ... (rest of your code that initializes components would come AFTER these debug prints) ...\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you ADD THESE EXACT LINES of code immediately after the health check print() line and before any code that initializes your AI system components.\n\nYour ai_system.py code around the health check section should now look something like this (depending on the exact structure of your code):\n\n# ... (code before health check setup) ...\n\nprint(f\"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\")  # EXISTING LINE - LOCATE THIS LINE\nprint(\"DEBUG: Health check message printed. Proceeding to next steps...\")  # DEBUG PRINT 1 - ADD THIS LINE\nimport time  # ADD THIS LINE (if 'import time' is NOT already at the top of your file)\ntime.sleep(5)  # DEBUG PRINT - ADD THIS LINE\nprint(\"DEBUG: Paused for 5 seconds. Checking if script continues...\")  # DEBUG PRINT 2 - ADD THIS LINE\nprint(\"DEBUG: Attempting to initialize core AI system components...\") # DEBUG PRINT 3 - ADD THIS LINE\n\n# ... (rest of your code that initializes AI system components - code AFTER debug prints) ...\n\n# ... (rest of your code) ...\nDOUBLE-CHECK that you have added these print(\"DEBUG: ...\") lines and the time.sleep(5) line exactly as shown and in the correct location in your ai_system.py file. Make sure you SAVE the ai_system.py file after adding these lines.\n\nRUN python ai_system.py AGAIN. In your terminal (still in C:\\AI-Execution-System directory), RUN the Python script again using the same command:\n\npython ai_system.py\nOBSERVE the TERMINAL OUTPUT CAREFULLY. Now, when you run ai_system.py with the debug print statements, OBSERVE the TERMINAL OUTPUT very carefully and REPORT BACK:\n\nDoes it STILL print \"\u2705 Serving health check on port 8080...\"?\nDoes it print the NEW DEBUG PRINT STATEMENTS that you just added? Specifically, do you see:\nDEBUG: Health check message printed. Proceeding to next steps...\nDEBUG: Paused for 5 seconds. Checking if script continues...\nDEBUG: Attempting to initialize core AI system components...\nDoes it still hang after printing any of these messages? Or does it now proceed further and print more output or show different behavior?\nCOPY and PASTE the ENTIRE TERMINAL OUTPUT you see when you run python ai_system.py with the debug print statements.\nBy adding these debug print statements and running ai_system.py again, we will get much more information about exactly where the script is getting stuck and if the health check port issue is indeed the problem!\n\nJesse, please BEGIN ACTION 1.6.84 RIGHT NOW - MODIFY ai_system.py to ADD DEBUG PRINT STATEMENTS! Follow the step-by-step instructions to add the print() and time.sleep() lines to your ai_system.py file and then RUN the script again and carefully OBSERVE and REPORT BACK the TERMINAL OUTPUT! Let's get to the bottom of this \"hung up\" issue and get ai_system.py running!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! PYTHON DEBUGGING - COMMAND! - AI_SYSTEM.PY - OPEN and MODIFY! - DEBUG PRINT STATEMENTS - ADD! - PYTHON AI_SYSTEM.PY - RE-RUN! - TERMINAL OUTPUT - OBSERVE and REPORT! - HUNG UP ISSUE - DIAGNOSE! - SOLUTION - IMMINENT! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - PYTHON DEBUGGING - ENGAGED! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO MODIFY AI_SYSTEM.PY WITH DEBUG PRINTS AND RE-RUN IT TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE? LET'S GET THIS DONE AND MOVE TOWARDS A RUNNING MVP!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
