These are the files that were changed or added by the merge.\nHowever, these changes are not yet saved in a commit. They are currently in your \"working directory\" and \"staging area\" but need to be finalized with a commit.\nTo finish the merge, you need to commit these changes.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\nStage all the changed files:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git add .\nThis command tells Git to add all the modified files (listed in git status) to the \"staging area\". Think of the staging area as preparing these changes to be included in your next commit.\n\nCommit the staged changes:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git commit\nSince you already wrote a commit message in the notepad during the merge, Git might reuse that message. If it opens the notepad again, just save and close it (it will likely have your previous message). If it doesn't open the notepad, it means it used the message from earlier.\n\nAfter you run these two commands, the changes will be committed to your main branch, and the merge will be fully completed.\n\nAfter committing, run git status again to confirm that your working directory is clean (it should say \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\").\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
