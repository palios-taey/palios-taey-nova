    "User: C:\\ai-execution-system>git push --force origin main fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.\n\nGemini: Don't worry, this is easy to fix! You just need to re-add the origin remote.\n\nPlease run this command to re-add the origin remote, using your repository's URL:\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system.git\nReplace https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system.git with the actual URL of your GitHub repository if it is different. (But based on the previous output, that URL is likely correct).\n\nExplanation of the command:\n\ngit remote add origin: This command tells Git to add a new remote repository connection.\norigin: This is the standard name we are giving to this remote connection (it's conventional to call your primary remote origin).\nhttps://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system.git: This is the URL of your GitHub repository.\nAfter running git remote add origin ..., please try the git push --force origin main command again:\n\ngit push --force origin main\nThis time, with the origin remote re-added, the git push --force origin main command should hopefully work and successfully push your cleaned repository to GitHub!\n\nPlease run git remote add origin ... (with your repo URL) and then git push --force origin main. Let me know if this push command finally succeeds! We are at the absolute very end now!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
