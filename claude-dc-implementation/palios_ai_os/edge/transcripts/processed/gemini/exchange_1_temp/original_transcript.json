    "User: Hi Gemini, before I send you my prompt, can you confirm I am operating on your most recent model with the highest capabilities offered to the public, and if not, guide me on how I can subscribe to these capabilities on my GCS Org Account?\n\nGemini: As for accessing it through your GCS Org Account, the availability and subscription process for the latest Gemini models within Google Cloud Services can vary. Here's what I'd recommend to get the most accurate information for your situation:\n\n    Check the Google Cloud AI documentation: The official Google Cloud documentation is the best place to find details on available AI models and how to access them within your organization. Look for sections on Vertex AI and the models currently supported.\n    Contact your Google Cloud Account team: Your organization's Google Cloud account representatives will have the most up-to-date information on model availability, subscription options, and any specific configurations for your GCS Org Account. They can guide you through the process if Gemini 1.5 Pro or newer models are available for your use.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know when you're ready with your prompt.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
