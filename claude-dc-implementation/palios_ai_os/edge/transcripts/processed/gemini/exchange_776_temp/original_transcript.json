    "User: GITHUB ACCOUNT READY - I don't think I need checkins this often. I would consider the need to check in when you need to know something to determine what's next. I'll proceed to 2nd step now and continue. If you agree, which its fine if you don't, let me know when to REALLY check in.\n\nGemini: NEW CHECK-IN PROTOCOL: INFORMATION-DRIVEN & ON-DEMAND\n\nYOU, JESSE, PROCEED AUTONOMOUSLY through the GitHub Setup Steps. Follow the instructions provided, moving through the steps at your maximum velocity.\nCHECK-IN ONLY WHEN REQUIRED for INFORMATION or CONFIRMATION: You ONLY NEED TO FORMALLY \"CHECK-IN\" when you reach a step where:\nYou need INFORMATION from Gemini to proceed (e.g., clarification on instructions, URL confirmation, decision point, etc.).\nGemini NEEDS CONFIRMATION from you that a step is completed successfully before defining the next action. (These will be specifically highlighted as \"REAL CHECK-IN POINTS\").\nGemini ALWAYS AVAILABLE for Questions & Support - ON-DEMAND: Gemini remains CONSTANTLY AVAILABLE for questions, clarification, and support at ANY TIME. If you encounter any issues, have questions, or need guidance at any point, DO NOT HESITATE to ASK! Just send a message, and Gemini will respond immediately to keep your momentum going.\nAssume \"No News is Good News\" for Check-ins: Unless explicitly requested as a \"REAL CHECK-IN POINT\" or if you have a question, you DO NOT need to formally check-in after each step. Assume \"no news is good news\" \u2013 Gemini will assume you are progressing smoothly unless you report otherwise or reach a designated \"REAL CHECK-IN POINT.\"\nREVISED GITHUB SETUP INSTRUCTIONS - INFORMATION-DRIVEN CHECK-IN MODE - GO! GO! GO!\n\nHere are the REVISED GITHUB SETUP INSTRUCTIONS with the NEW INFORMATION-DRIVEN CHECK-IN PROTOCOL. \"REAL CHECK-IN POINTS\" are explicitly highlighted. For all other steps, proceed autonomously and only check-in if you have a question or issue.\n\nSTEP 1: GITHUB ACCOUNT READY (ASSUMED - ALREADY COMPLETE - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED)\n\n(Assume COMPLETE): We assume you have already completed STEP 1 (GitHub Account Ready). No need to report on this unless you encountered any issues.\nSTEP 2: CREATE A NEW PRIVATE GITHUB REPOSITORY - NAMED ai-execution-system-core - REAL CHECK-IN POINT #1\n\n(ACTION 2.1-2.3): Follow ACTIONS 2.1-2.3 from the previous instructions to create a new PRIVATE GitHub repository named ai-execution-system-core.\nREAL CHECK-IN POINT #1: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #1 - GITHUB REPO CREATED: ai-execution-system-core\" AFTER successfully creating the private repository named ai-execution-system-core on GitHub, please REPORT BACK: \"CHECK-IN #1 - GITHUB REPO CREATED: ai-execution-system-core\". This is a REAL CHECK-IN POINT - we need to confirm the repo name is correct before proceeding.\nSTEP 3: INSTALL GIT ON YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER (If Not Already Installed) - AUTONOMOUS - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue)\n\n(ACTION 3.1-3.3): Follow ACTIONS 3.1-3.3 from the previous instructions to check if Git is installed and install it if necessary.\nNO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue): No need to report back specifically for this step unless you encounter any issues during Git installation. If installation is successful, proceed directly to Step 4. If you have an issue, report it immediately.\nSTEP 4: CONFIGURE GIT USERNAME and EMAIL - AUTONOMOUS - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue)\n\n(ACTION 4.1-4.3): Follow ACTIONS 4.1-4.3 from the previous instructions to configure your Git username and email.\nNO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue): No need to report back specifically for this step unless you encounter any issues during Git configuration. If configuration is successful, proceed directly to Step 5. If you have an issue, report it immediately.\nSTEP 5: INITIALIZE A LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY in YOUR AI EXECUTION SYSTEM PROJECT FOLDER - AUTONOMOUS - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue)\n\n(ACTION 5.1-5.2): Follow ACTIONS 5.1-5.2 from the previous instructions to initialize a local Git repository in your project folder.\nNO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue): No need to report back specifically for this step unless you encounter any issues. If initialization is successful, proceed directly to Step 6. If you have an issue, report it immediately.\nSTEP 6: ADD ALL PROJECT FILES to GIT - AUTONOMOUS - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue)\n\n(ACTION 6.1): Follow ACTION 6.1 from the previous instructions to stage all project files using git add ..\nNO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue): No need to report back specifically for this step unless you encounter any issues. If staging is successful, proceed directly to Step 7. If you have an issue, report it immediately.\nSTEP 7: COMMIT THE INITIAL FILES with a COMMIT MESSAGE - AUTONOMOUS - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue)\n\n(ACTION 7.1): Follow ACTION 7.1 from the previous instructions to commit the staged files using git commit -m \"Initial commit...\".\nNO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue): No need to report back specifically for this step unless you encounter any issues. If commit is successful, proceed directly to Step 8. If you have an issue, report it immediately.\nSTEP 8: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY to Your REMOTE GITHUB REPOSITORY - AUTONOMOUS - NO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue)\n\n(ACTION 8.1-8.2): Follow ACTIONS 8.1-8.2 from the previous instructions to get your GitHub repository URL and add the remote origin.\nNO CHECK-IN NEEDED (Unless Issue): No need to report back specifically for this step unless you encounter any issues. If adding remote origin is successful, proceed directly to Step 9. If you have an issue, report it immediately.\nSTEP 9: PUSH YOUR LOCAL CODEBASE to GITHUB - REAL CHECK-IN POINT #2\n\n(ACTION 9.1-9.2): Follow ACTIONS 9.1-9.2 from the previous instructions to push your local codebase to GitHub using git push -u origin main.\nREAL CHECK-IN POINT #2: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #2 - GITHUB PUSH COMPLETE - CODE UPLOADED\" AFTER the git push command is finished and you see a \"push successful\" message, please REPORT BACK: \"CHECK-IN #2 - GITHUB PUSH COMPLETE - CODE UPLOADED\". This is a REAL CHECK-IN POINT - we need to confirm successful code upload to GitHub before proceeding further.\n(ACTION 10.1-10.2): AFTER reporting \"CHECK-IN #2\", proceed to ACTION 10.1-10.2 (Verify Code Uploaded on GitHub Website) to perform the final verification yourself. No need to report back separately for this verification step unless you have any doubts or issues.\nLET'S MAXIMIZE YOUR VELOCITY, JESSE! Proceed AUTONOMOUSLY through these steps, only checking in at the TWO \"REAL CHECK-IN POINTS\" or if you need assistance. Gemini is here to support you at any time. GITHUB - LFG! ACTION! GO! GO! GO! Report back with \"CHECK-IN #1\" after creating the GitHub repo, and \"CHECK-IN #2\" after pushing the code! Let's BOOM forward!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
