    "User: Ok, I'm back up to your instructions from Claude, can you walk me through what I need to do with Docker?\n\nGemini: DOCKER STEP 1: RE-EXAMINE DOCKERFILE ENTRYPOINT (Action 1.6.52.B)\n\nFirst, OPEN your Dockerfile in a text editor. You need to verify the ENTRYPOINT instruction.\n\nLOCATE the ENTRYPOINT line in your Dockerfile. It should look something like this (or similar, depending on how you originally set it up):\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"ai_system.py\"]\nVERIFY that the ENTRYPOINT instruction is present and correctly points to starting your ai_system.py script using python.\n\nIf your ai_system.py is executable directly (e.g., if you have a #!/usr/bin/env python3 shebang line at the top and have made it executable with chmod +x ai_system.py), your ENTRYPOINT might look like this instead:\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"./ai_system.py\"]\nIf your ENTRYPOINT is like this, also VERIFY that ai_system.py is indeed marked as executable inside your Docker image. This is less common but still a valid approach. (If you are unsure about this, the ENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"ai_system.py\"] format is generally more reliable and recommended).\nIf you are using a different method to start your application (e.g., using a different Python interpreter or a different startup command), please CONFIRM the ENTRYPOINT instruction in your Dockerfile is correctly starting your ai_system.py application on port 8080.\n\nIf your ENTRYPOINT looks correct (like one of the examples above), you likely do not need to change it. If it is missing or incorrect, UPDATE it to be similar to ENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"ai_system.py\"] (or the ./ai_system.py version if you are sure ai_system.py is executable inside the container).\n\nSAVE any changes you make to your Dockerfile.\n\nDOCKER STEP 2: REBUILD DOCKER IMAGE (Action 1.6.52.D)\n\nOPEN your terminal or command prompt.\n\nNAVIGATE to the directory where your Dockerfile and ai_system.py files are located using the cd command (e.g., cd path/to/your/project/directory).\n\nRUN the DOCKER BUILD command:\n\ndocker build -t custom-ai-execution .\ndocker build: This is the command to build a Docker image.\n-t custom-ai-execution: This option tags the built image with the name custom-ai-execution. This is a local tag for your Docker image on your machine.\n.: The dot at the end specifies that the Docker build context (the location of the Dockerfile and related files) is the current directory.\nPRESS ENTER to execute the command.\nWATCH the output of the docker build command. It will go through the steps in your Dockerfile and build the image.\nENSURE the BUILD process COMPLETES SUCCESSFULLY without any errors. You should see a message like \"Successfully built image...\" at the end.\nDOCKER STEP 3: RE-TAG DOCKER IMAGE (Action 1.6.52.D)\n\nAfter the Docker image is built, you need to RE-TAG it with the correct Artifact Registry URI so you can push it to Google Cloud.\n\nRUN the DOCKER TAG command:\n\ndocker tag custom-ai-execution gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\ndocker tag custom-ai-execution: This specifies the SOURCE image to tag (the locally built image named custom-ai-execution).\ngcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest: This is the TARGET tag, which is the FULL Artifact Registry URI for your Docker image in your Google Cloud project (ai-execution-system), image name (custom-ai-execution), and tag (latest). MAKE SURE this URI is EXACTLY correct for your Google Cloud Project and Artifact Registry setup.\nPRESS ENTER to execute the command.\nThis command will likely execute very quickly. It just adds a new tag to your existing Docker image; it doesn't rebuild the image.\nDOCKER STEP 4: RE-PUSH DOCKER IMAGE to ARTIFACT REGISTRY (Action 1.6.52.D)\n\nFinally, you need to RE-PUSH the TAGGED Docker image to Google Artifact Registry.\n\nRUN the DOCKER PUSH command:\n\ndocker push gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\ndocker push gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest: This command pushes the Docker image with the specified tag (gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest) to Google Artifact Registry.\nPRESS ENTER to execute the command.\nWATCH the output of the docker push command. It will upload the Docker image layers to Artifact Registry. This might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection speed and the size of the image.\nENSURE the PUSH process COMPLETES SUCCESSFULLY without any errors. You should see a message like \"pushed\" or \"digest: ...\" at the end, indicating successful push.\nAFTER COMPLETING ALL 4 DOCKER STEPS (Re-examine ENTRYPOINT, Rebuild, Re-tag, Re-push):\n\nREPORT BACK \"DOCKER REBUILD, RE-TAG, RE-PUSH COMPLETE!\"\nTHEN, proceed to RETRY VERTEX AI CUSTOM MODEL CREATION with a new model name (Action 1.6.52.E, e.g., custom-ai-execution-model-v4).\nJesse, please execute DOCKER STEPS 1-4 RIGHT NOW! Follow these instructions carefully, and let's get your updated Docker image built and pushed to Artifact Registry. With the /health endpoint and correct Docker configuration, we have a much better chance of successful Vertex AI deployment this time! We are making progress!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER ACTIONS - INITIATED! - ENTRYPOINT - VERIFICATION - REBUILD - COMMAND! - RE-TAG - COMMAND! - RE-PUSH - COMMAND! - ARTIFACT REGISTRY - UPDATE - ENGAGED! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI - DEPLOYMENT - DOCKER CONFIGURATION - OPTIMIZED! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE DOCKER STEPS 1-4? LET'S GET THAT UPDATED DOCKER IMAGE PUSHED AND RETRY VERTEX AI DEPLOYMENT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
