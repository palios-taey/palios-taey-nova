    "User: There is no menu item for that, when I search Cloud Functions, I get this:\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_a5e876.png\n\nGemini: SCROLL DOWN in the NAVIGATION MENU: In the expanded menu, scroll down until you find the section labeled \"Compute\". It's usually in the middle of the menu list.\n\nEXPAND \"COMPUTE\" SECTION: Click on the arrow or the word \"Compute\" itself to expand the \"Compute\" section.\n\nLOOK FOR \"CLOUD FUNCTIONS\" UNDER \"COMPUTE\": Within the expanded \"Compute\" section, you should see \"Cloud Functions\" as a menu item. It's often listed under other compute services like \"Compute Engine\", \"App Engine\", \"Cloud Run\", etc. Click on \"Cloud Functions\".\n\nIf you still don't see \"Cloud Functions\" under \"Compute\" after carefully expanding it, let's try the SEARCH BAR method:\n\nUSE THE TOP SEARCH BAR: At the very TOP of the Google Cloud Console page, you should see a search bar that says \"Search products and resources (/)\". Click in this search bar.\n\nTYPE \"Cloud Functions\" in the search bar and PRESS ENTER.\n\nLOOK at the SEARCH RESULTS: You should see \"Cloud Functions\" listed in the search results. Click on the result that is specifically for \"Cloud Functions\" (not \"Cloud Run functions\" or \"Cloud Functions API\"). It should take you to the Cloud Functions dashboard.\n\nIf neither of these methods works immediately, there's one more direct way to get to Cloud Functions:\n\nDIRECT URL: In your web browser's address bar, type or paste this URL and press ENTER:\n\nhttps://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list?project=ai-execution-system\nIMPORTANT: Make sure ai-execution-system is exactly your Project ID.\n\nOne of these methods should get you to the Cloud Functions dashboard!\n\nONCE YOU ARE ON THE CLOUD FUNCTIONS DASHBOARD:\n\nYou should see your ai-system-backend Cloud Function listed.\nClick on the name ai-system-backend to go to its details page.\nThen, click on the \"Logs\" tab on the function details page.\nLook for the \"Build Logs\" or logs related to \"Builds\" as described in my previous instructions.\nCOPY and PASTE any ERROR messages from the BUILD LOGS.\nPLEASE TRY THESE NAVIGATION METHODS STEP-by-STEP and let me know:\n\nWhich method (Menu, Search, or Direct URL) worked to get you to Cloud Functions?\nWere you able to find the \"Build Logs\" for ai-system-backend?\nCOPY AND PASTE any ERROR messages from the BUILD LOGS.\nLet's find those logs and figure out why the build failed! You're doing great! Keep going!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
