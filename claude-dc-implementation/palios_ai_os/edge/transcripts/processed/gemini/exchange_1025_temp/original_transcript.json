    "User: I sent you all logs. Those are everything that is listed when I go to the link. Is there somewhere else I need to look?\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_a45029.jpg\n\nGemini: Go to your Git Bash terminal where you ran the ./universal-deploy-script.sh ... command.\nLook at the output from the last time you ran the script.\nIn that output, find the line that starts with \"Logs are available at: [ ...Cloud Build URL... ]\" It should be a URL that looks something like: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds/...\nIt's VERY IMPORTANT that you open this CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL in your browser, NOT the Cloud RUN logs URL.\n\nOnce you have opened the CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL in your browser:\n\nOn the Cloud Build logs page, you will see a list of \"Steps\" on the left side. Look for a step that is clearly related to \"build\" or \"docker-build\". It might be called just \"build\", or \"Build image\", or something similar.\nClick on the name of the \"build\" step. This will expand the logs for that specific step.\nSCROLL DOWN within the logs of the \"build\" step. Look for the lines that are the output of the command RUN ls -l /app/. It will look like a file listing, starting with total ... and then showing files and directories within the /app/ directory in your Docker image.\nCOPY and PASTE the ENTIRE ls -l /app/ OUTPUT from the CLOUD BUILD LOGS here. We need to see this file listing to understand what's inside your Docker image and why Flask might be missing.\n\nIt's crucial to get the ls -l /app/ output from the CLOUD BUILD logs, not Cloud RUN logs. Please find the correct URL in your Git Bash output and get that log information for me. This is the key to solving the flask problem! Let's do it!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
