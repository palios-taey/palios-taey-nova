    "User: Yes, I saw status:healthy, so its working! You tell me what's next according to your MVP plan. Still waiting on Vertex...\n\nGemini: HERE'S THE MVP PLAN, ADJUSTED FOR OUR CURRENT STATE (Vertex AI pending):\n\nMVP Core Functionality (Focus First): Let's prioritize building and testing the CORE FUNCTIONALITY of the AI Execution System using the currently available OpenAI models (gpt-4-turbo-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo). We can achieve a significant portion of the MVP with just OpenAI.\nVertex AI Integration (Secondary, but still important): We will keep the Vertex AI integration as a HIGH priority, but since we are \"still waiting,\" we will proceed in parallel by building functionality that doesn't depend on Vertex AI first. As soon as Vertex AI access is granted, we'll integrate and test those task types.\nMVP Task Types (Start with OpenAI): For the MVP, let's focus on these task types initially, leveraging OpenAI:\nopenai_completion Tasks: Simple text generation and basic queries using gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-turbo-preview. We can test both simple and complex reasoning task routing.\ncollaborative Tasks: Task decomposition and execution using gpt-4-turbo-preview to break down tasks and coordinate sub-tasks using OpenAI models.\nBasic Task Management (MVP Level): We can implement basic task creation, status tracking, and result retrieval. We don't need a complex UI for the MVP \u2013 simple Python scripts to interact with the system will be sufficient.\nHealth Check (Already Done!): We have the health check server running \u2013 excellent!\nNEXT STEP - CREATE A SCRIPT TO CREATE AND EXECUTE TASKS (OPENAI ONLY, FOR NOW):\n\nTo move forward and demonstrate the system's core functionality, let's create a new Python script that will:\n\nImport the AISystem class (from ai_system.py).\nInitialize an AISystem object. This will connect to Firestore and initialize the AI capabilities.\nCreate a simple openai_completion task. We can start with a very basic text generation task.\nExecute the task using the AISystem object.\nRetrieve and print the task result.\nThis new script will allow us to:\n\nTest the task creation pathway.\nTest the task execution pathway (using OpenAI).\nVerify that results are being stored and can be retrieved.\nMake tangible progress on the MVP while we wait for Vertex AI.\nWOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE PYTHON CODE FOR THIS NEW SCRIPT to create and execute a simple openai_completion task?\n\nIf yes, I will provide you with a new Python script (let's call it create_and_execute_task.py) that you can create in the C:\\AI-Execution-System directory. You can then run this script separately from the ai_system.py health check server (which should keep running in another terminal).\n\nLet me know if you want to proceed with creating this create_and_execute_task.py script, and I'll provide you with the code and instructions!\n\nGREAT JOB getting the health check server running! Now let's start building and testing the TASK EXECUTION functionality! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
