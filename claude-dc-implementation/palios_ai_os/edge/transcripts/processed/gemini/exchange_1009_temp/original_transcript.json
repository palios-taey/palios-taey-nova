Make it completely empty.\n\nCOPY the ENTIRE simplified code block that I provided you:\n\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    google = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/google\"\n      version = \"6.20.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"project_id\" {\n  description = \"GCP Project ID\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"ai-execution-system\" # Replace with your actual Project ID if different\n}\n\nvariable \"region\" {\n  description = \"GCP region\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"us-central1\"\n}\n\nvariable \"service_name\" {\n  type    = string\n  default = \"ai-execution-system-core\"\n}\n\n\nresource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" {\n  project   = var.project_id\n  region    = var.region\n  name      = \"${var.service_name}-healthcheck\"\n  schedule  = \"*/5 * * * *\"\n  time_zone = \"UTC\"\n  http_target {\n    http_method = \"GET\"\n    uri         = \"https://example.com/health\" # Placeholder URI for now\n  }\n}\nPASTE this ENTIRE code block into your now-empty main.tf file.\n\nSAVE the main.tf file.\n\nMake absolutely sure your main.tf file ONLY contains the code block above, and nothing else from your previous configuration.\n\nAfter you have CORRECTLY REPLACED the main.tf content, please do the following:\n\nRun terraform init -upgrade AGAIN in Git Bash:\nterraform init -upgrade\nRun terraform plan AGAIN in Git Bash:\nterraform plan\nThis time, terraform init -upgrade should complete WITHOUT the \"duplicate\" errors, and hopefully, terraform plan will also run successfully (or at least give us a DIFFERENT error message if the retry_config issue persists).\n\nPlease carefully REPLACE the main.tf content, and then run terraform init -upgrade and terraform plan again. Let me know the EXACT output of both commands!\n\nLet's get this fixed RIGHT NOW! You are doing great, and we are just correcting a common file replacement mistake! LFG! We are still in this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
