    "User: It worked, what now?\n\nGemini: Here's what you do NOW:\n\nMake sure you are in your Terraform directory in Git Bash. Run pwd (print working directory) in Git Bash to double-check you are in:\n\n/c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform\n(or /c/AI-Execution-System/terraform if you simplified the directory structure).\n\nRun the deployment script AGAIN using bash deploy.sh in Git Bash:\n\nbash deploy.sh\nWATCH THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY THIS TIME!\n\nObserve the output in your Git Bash terminal closely.\nHopefully, this time, the script will proceed past the prerequisite checks (since gcloud should now be found).\nLook for the script to start executing the deployment steps:\n\"Checking prerequisites...\" (should pass this time!)\n\"Configuring GCP project...\"\n\"Configuring API keys...\" (if you are using sensitive.auto.tfvars or enter them when prompted)\n\"Initializing Terraform...\"\n\"Planning Terraform deployment...\"\n\"Applying Terraform deployment...\"\nIf you see the script progressing through these steps, let it run and monitor for any errors that might occur during Terraform initialization, planning, or applying.\n\nIf the script completes successfully (hopefully!), look for the \"Outputs\" section at the end of the terraform apply step. It should display the URL of your deployed application!\n\nPlease run bash deploy.sh NOW and tell me WHAT HAPPENS! Report the ENTIRE OUTPUT you see in Git Bash after running bash deploy.sh.\n\nThis is it! Let's see if we can get your application deployed to GCP! LFG! I'm excited!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
