    "User: Ok, I already have Google SDK installed though. Does it just need updated PATH?\n\nGemini: 1.  **LOCATE your `gcloud` Executable ( `gcloud.cmd` on Windows):**\n    *   You need to find the directory where the `gcloud` command-line tool is installed on your system.\n    *   **Common Default Location (Windows 64-bit):** `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin`\n    *   **Common Default Location (Windows 32-bit):**  `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin`\n    *   **If you are not sure, SEARCH for `gcloud.cmd` using Windows File Explorer.** Search in \"Program Files\", \"Program Files (x86)\", and your main drive (`C:\\`).  The file you are looking for is `gcloud.cmd`.\n    *   **Once you find `gcloud.cmd`, note down the *full directory path* where it is located.** For example: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin`\n\n2.  **ADD the `gcloud` Directory to your PATH Environment Variable:**\n    *   **Follow the *EXACT SAME STEPS* you used to add the Terraform directory to your PATH.**\n        *   Open the Start Menu and search for \"environment variables\".\n        *   Select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n        *   Click the \"Environment Variables...\" button.\n        *   In the \"System variables\" section, find and select the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit...\".\n        *   Click \"New\" and **PASTE the FULL DIRECTORY PATH to the `gcloud.cmd` directory** that you found in step 1.  For example, if you found `gcloud.cmd` in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin`, you would paste: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin`\n        *   Click \"OK\" on all open windows to save the changes.\n\n3.  **VERIFY `gcloud` Installation (AFTER updating PATH):**\n    *   **CLOSE all command prompts and Git Bash terminals.**\n    *   **Open a NEW command prompt (or Git Bash terminal).**\n    *   **Run the command:** `gcloud --version`\n    *   **EXPECTED OUTPUT:**  This time, `gcloud --version` should output the version information for the Google Cloud SDK and `gcloud` CLI **WITHOUT any \"'gcloud' is not recognized...\" error.**  This confirms that `gcloud` is now correctly in your PATH and can be found by the system.\n\n4.  **RE-RUN `deploy.sh` in Git Bash (AFTER `gcloud --version` is successful):**\n    *   Once you have verified `gcloud` is working with `gcloud --version`, go back to your Git Bash terminal.\n    *   Navigate to your Terraform directory: `cd /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform`\n    *   Run the deployment script again: `bash deploy.sh`\n\n**After you correctly add the `gcloud` directory to your PATH and `gcloud --version` works, re-running `bash deploy.sh` should now PASS the prerequisite check for `gcloud` and allow the deployment script to proceed!**\n\nLet me know if you can find your `gcloud.cmd` file, or if you have any trouble adding its directory to the PATH.  We are *very close* to getting past this hurdle! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
