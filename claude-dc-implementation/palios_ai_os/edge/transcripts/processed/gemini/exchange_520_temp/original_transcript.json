    "User: Vertex was not deployed, I was still trying to configure it and ran into issue with docker i think: C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK>gcloud logging read \"resource.type=aiplatform.googleapis.com/Model\" --limit 20 --format=json []\n\nGemini: \"NO RESULTS\" from deployment logs now MAKES PERFECT SENSE! If the deployment process itself never successfully initiated due to a Docker issue during configuration, then there would be no deployment logs to retrieve. The failure is happening before the deployment process even reaches the stage where logs are generated for a deployment attempt.\n\nOur DEBUGGING FOCUS MUST IMMEDIATELY SHIFT to ADDRESSING the DOCKER ISSUES you encountered during Vertex AI configuration. This is now the MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE preventing Vertex AI deployment and therefore, preventing us from proceeding with database integration within Vertex AI.\n\nLET'S RE-ENGAGE with the \"\ud83d\udd25 Execution Blocker - Docker Not Installed & Invalid Docker String\" NOTES and SYSTEMATICALLY RESOLVE THESE DOCKER ISSUES.\n\nACTION 1.6.10: SYSTEMATICALLY TROUBLESHOOT DOCKER ISSUES based on \"Execution Blocker\" Notes:\n\nPlease go back to your \"\ud83d\udd25 Execution Blocker - Docker Not Installed & Invalid Docker String\" NOTES and carefully follow the FIX STEPS outlined there, step-by-step. Let's break down the troubleshooting based on those notes:\n\nISSUE 1: DOCKER NOT RECOGNIZED as a COMMAND:\n\nVERIFICATION STEP 1.6.10.A: CHECK if DOCKER DESKTOP is INSTALLED:\n\nAre you SURE Docker Desktop is installed on your system? Double-check that you have downloaded and installed Docker Desktop from the link provided in your notes: Download Docker.\nIf you are not sure, please GO AHEAD and DOWNLOAD and INSTALL Docker Desktop NOW. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\nVERIFICATION STEP 1.6.10.B: CHECK if DOCKER is in SYSTEM PATH:\n\nAfter installation, RESTART your SYSTEM. This is often necessary for Docker to be properly added to the system PATH.\nOpen a NEW COMMAND PROMPT (or Google Cloud SDK Shell).\nRun the command: docker --version\nEXPECTED OUTPUT: You should see a valid Docker version number printed in the command prompt, like: Docker version x.y.z, build ...\nREPORT BACK:\nDid docker --version command WORK? (Yes/No)\nIf YES, please report the DOCKER VERSION NUMBER displayed.\nIf NO, the error is likely still \"docker' is not recognized...\". This means Docker is still not correctly installed or in your PATH. If you get this \"NO,\" we need to revisit Docker Desktop installation and PATH configuration.\nISSUE 2: INVALID DOCKER STRING in ARTIFACT REGISTRY:\n\nOnce we have CONFIRMED DOCKER INSTALLATION and docker --version is working, we can then address the \"Invalid Docker String\" error, IF it still persists when you try to interact with Google Artifact Registry.\n\nVERIFICATION STEP 1.6.10.C: CHECK ARTIFACT REGISTRY REPOSITORY FORMAT:\n\nRun the command to list Artifact Registry repositories:\n\ngcloud artifacts repositories list --format=\"table(name, format)\"\nREVIEW the OUTPUT: Verify that the format listed for your Artifact Registry repository is DOCKER. This confirms you have a Docker repository in Artifact Registry.\n\nREPORT BACK:\n\nIs the format for your repository listed as DOCKER? (Yes/No)\nVERIFICATION STEP 1.6.10.D: CHECK CORRECT IMAGE FORMAT for ARTIFACT REGISTRY LISTING:\n\nRun the command to list Docker images in your Artifact Registry repository (replace LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID with your actual Artifact Registry path \u2013 you should have this from your notes or previous configurations):\n\ngcloud artifacts docker images list LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID --format=\"table(name)\"\nREPLACE LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY-ID with your CORRECT ARTIFACT REGISTRY PATH. Double-check this path for accuracy.\n\nREVIEW the OUTPUT:\n\nDo you see any Docker IMAGE NAMES listed in the output? (This would indicate that you have successfully pushed Docker images to your Artifact Registry repository previously).\nIf you DON'T see any images listed, it might mean you have not yet successfully PUSHED a Docker image to your repository, or the repository path is incorrect.\nVERIFICATION STEP 1.6.10.E: If NO IMAGES FOUND in Artifact Registry, TRY DOCKER PUSH:\n\nIf the previous command showed no images, let's try to PUSH a Docker image to your Artifact Registry. Use the docker push command from your notes:\n\ndocker push gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nNOTE: REPLACE gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest with your ACTUAL DOCKER IMAGE NAME and TAG if it is different. Ensure this image name matches what you are trying to push.\nRUN this docker push command.\nOBSERVE the OUTPUT:\nDoes the docker push command SUCCEED and complete without errors? (Look for \"Pushed\" status or successful completion messages).\nOR, does the docker push command FAIL with an ERROR? (If it fails, copy and paste the FULL ERROR MESSAGE).\nJesse, please systematically go through these VERIFICATION STEPS for DOCKER INSTALLATION and ARTIFACT REGISTRY based on your \"Execution Blocker\" notes. Let's resolve these Docker-related issues FIRST, as they are likely preventing your Vertex AI deployment from even starting.\n\nREPORT BACK the RESULTS of EACH VERIFICATION STEP (1.6.10.A through 1.6.10.E). The more detailed information you provide about the output of each command, the better I can assist you in diagnosing and fixing these Docker issues.\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER TROUBLESHOOTING - INITIATED! - STEP-BY-STEP VERIFICATION - EXECUTE! - CONTAINERIZATION ISSUES - RESOLVING! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER - MASTERING - NOW! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN ACTION 1.6.10 - DOCKER VERIFICATION? LET'S TACKLE THESE DOCKER ISSUES!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
