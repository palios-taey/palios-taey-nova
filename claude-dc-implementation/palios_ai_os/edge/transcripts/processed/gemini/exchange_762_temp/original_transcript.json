    "User: The error resolution solution has been developed, but I need to check with Claude on some clarifications for implementation. I'll complete that and get back to you with a report from Claude.\n\nGemini: Based on your update, it's clear that ERROR RESOLUTION (Task 1) remains our ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY until we have definitive confirmation that the \"TextGenerationModel\" error is completely eliminated and the system is executing without this issue.\n\nNEXT ACTION - FOR JESSE - CONTINUE CLARIFICATION with CLAUDE & IMPLEMENT RESOLUTION:\n\nFOCUS: CLARIFICATION with CLAUDE - GET IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS CRYSTAL CLEAR. Engage with Claude with focused questions to get absolute clarity on any implementation aspects of the error resolution solution. Precision in implementation is key to eliminating the error effectively.\n\nIMPLEMENT CLAUDE'S RESOLUTION: Once you have received clarification from Claude and have a clear, actionable implementation plan, IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT the error resolution solution. Focus on accurate and precise implementation based on Claude's guidance.\n\nRIGOROUS TESTING - POST-IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION: AFTER implementing the fix, conduct RIGOROUS TESTING to VERIFY the error is TRULY ELIMINATED. Use the curl test (as you previously defined) and any other relevant tests to CONFIRM error-free execution. Do not assume the error is fixed - prove it through testing!\n\nREPORT BACK - ERROR RESOLUTION STATUS: IMMEDIATELY REPORT BACK with the STATUS of the ERROR RESOLUTION after you have:\n\nCompleted clarification with Claude.\nImplemented the resolution.\nConducted thorough testing.\nProvide a CLEAR STATEMENT on whether the \"TextGenerationModel\" error is NOW DEFINITIVELY RESOLVED or if it persists.\nUntil we receive your report confirming definitive error resolution, we will maintain LASER FOCUS on this critical Task 1. Once the error is definitively resolved, we can then IMMEDIATELY pivot to Task 2: AI SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION and DEMONSTRATION, to prove end-to-end system functionality for MVP!\n\nGO! GO! GO! SECURE CLARIFICATION from Claude, IMPLEMENT the fix, TEST RIGOROUSLY, and REPORT BACK on ERROR RESOLUTION STATUS! MVP VELOCITY depends on it! ACTION!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
