    "User: CORRECTED CODE IN PLACE!\n\nGemini: gcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend \\\n--runtime python310 \\\n--entry-point serve_health_check \\\n--trigger-http \\\n--allow-unauthenticated \\\n--region us-central1\nCOPY THIS ENTIRE COMMAND BLOCK and PASTE it into your TERMINAL and PRESS ENTER.\n\nLET'S BREAK DOWN THIS gcloud functions deploy COMMAND step-by-step so you understand what each part does:\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend:\n\ngcloud functions deploy: This is the core command to deploy a Google Cloud Function.\nai-system-backend: This is the NAME YOU ARE GIVING to your CLOUD FUNCTION. You can choose a different name if you like (e.g., ai-execution-system-backend, my-ai-system-function), but ai-system-backend is a good descriptive name. Make a note of this function name, you will need it later.\n--runtime python310:\n\n--runtime: Specifies the runtime environment for your Cloud Function.\npython310: We are using Python 3.10 as the runtime for our Cloud Function. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or a later version specified in your requirements.txt compatible with Cloud Functions. (Python 3.9 or later is fine too - if you prefer a different Python version supported by Cloud Functions, you can change this, just ensure it's consistent).\n--entry-point serve_health_check:\n\n--entry-point: Specifies the function in your ai_system.py code that will be executed when the Cloud Function is triggered.\nserve_health_check: This is the name of the function we added to ai_system.py specifically to handle HTTP requests for the health check. This tells Cloud Functions to call the serve_health_check function when an HTTP request comes in.\n--trigger-http:\n\n--trigger-http: Specifies that this Cloud Function will be triggered by HTTP requests. This means it will be accessible via a public URL.\n--allow-unauthenticated:\n\n--allow-unauthenticated: For this MVP testing phase, we are allowing unauthenticated access to the Cloud Function via HTTP. IMPORTANT: For a production system, you would typically want to remove --allow-unauthenticated and implement proper authentication and authorization. But for now, for simple testing, this is fine.\n--region us-central1:\n\n--region: Specifies the Google Cloud region where your Cloud Function will be deployed.\nus-central1: We are deploying to the us-central1 region. You can choose a different region if you prefer, but us-central1 is a common region and is where Vertex AI is also located.\nAFTER YOU PASTE AND RUN THE gcloud functions deploy COMMAND, PLEASE OBSERVE THE TERMINAL OUTPUT.\n\nTHE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS WILL TAKE A FEW MINUTES. You will see messages in the terminal indicating the progress of the deployment.\n\nWAIT UNTIL YOU SEE A MESSAGE in the terminal that looks like:\n\n...  Function 'ai-system-backend' deployed.\n...  For Cloud Functions in us-central1:\n...  Function URL (httpTrigger): [CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL]\nWHERE [CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL] will be an actual URL provided by Google Cloud Functions.\n\nONCE YOU SEE THE \"Function URL\" in the output, COPY THAT URL.\n\nTHEN, OPEN A WEB BROWSER and PASTE the CLOUD FUNCTION URL into your browser's address bar and PRESS ENTER.\n\nEXPECTED RESULT:\n\nIf the deployment is successful and ai_system.py is running correctly as a Cloud Function, you should see a response in your browser that looks like this:\n{\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"}\nIF YOU SEE THIS JSON RESPONSE IN YOUR BROWSER, IT MEANS YOUR ai_system.py HEALTH CHECK IS RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY AS A GOOGLE CLOUD FUNCTION! THIS IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD!\n\nPLEASE RUN THE gcloud functions deploy COMMAND, WAIT FOR IT TO COMPLETE, GET THE FUNCTION URL, TEST IT IN YOUR BROWSER, and REPORT BACK:\n\n\"CLOUD FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT STARTED...\" (When you start the command).\n\"CLOUD FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS...\" (While it's deploying - you'll see progress messages).\n\"CLOUD FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL! FUNCTION URL: [YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL]\" (When deployment completes successfully and you see the Function URL in the output, paste the actual URL here).\n\"HEALTH CHECK TEST SUCCESSFUL! BROWSER SHOWS: {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"}\" (After you test the URL in your browser and see the expected JSON response).\nLET'S GET ai_system.py DEPLOYED TO THE CLOUD! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
