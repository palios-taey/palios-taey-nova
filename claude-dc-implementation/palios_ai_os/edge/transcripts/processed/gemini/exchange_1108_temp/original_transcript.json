    "User: Please don't put the path in cmd prompts. It slows me down. C:\\ai-execution-system>git filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform git-filter-repo: error: unrecognized arguments: --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform C:\\ai-execution-system>\n\nGemini: Let's simplify the command. For just removing a directory from history, the --path argument should be enough. Please try this corrected, simplified command instead:\n\ngit filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform\nExplanation of the corrected command:\n\ngit filter-repo --force: This is the same as before - starts history rewriting with force.\n--path deployment/terraform/.terraform: This correctly specifies the path to filter out of history (the .terraform directory).\nWe have removed --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform. For simply removing a directory and not needing to reorganize the repository, --strip-prefix might not be necessary and could be causing the error.\nPlease run this simplified git filter-repo command:\n\ngit filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform\nand let me know if it runs without errors this time. After this, we can proceed with the git push --force origin main command again. We are so close!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
