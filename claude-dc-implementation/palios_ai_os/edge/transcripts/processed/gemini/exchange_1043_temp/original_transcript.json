Double-check every character, spaces, and backslashes (\\). Even a tiny typo will prevent it from working.\n\nAre there any other Python paths listed in your Path variable? If so, make sure the Google Cloud SDK paths are listed BEFORE any other Python paths. Use the \"Move Up\" button to reorder them if necessary. Having other Python paths listed before the Google Cloud SDK's bundled Python can cause conflicts.\n\nIf you make ANY changes to your Path variable (adding, editing, reordering), remember to click \"OK\" in ALL the Environment Variables windows to SAVE the changes and then RESTART YOUR COMPUTER again. Restarting is crucial for the changes to fully take effect.\n\nTEST the gcloud command from the STANDARD WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT (cmd.exe) - IMPORTANT STEP:\n\nCLOSE all MINGW64 terminal windows.\nPress the Windows key and type: cmd\nSelect \"Command Prompt\" to open the standard Windows command prompt (cmd.exe).\nIn the cmd.exe window, type the command: gcloud --version and press ENTER.\nWhat is the output of gcloud --version in cmd.exe?\n\nIf gcloud --version WORKS in cmd.exe and shows you the gcloud version information, it means the PATH is likely set up correctly at the system level and gcloud can find Python in the standard Windows environment. In this case, the issue might be something specific to MINGW64's environment.\nIf gcloud --version FAILS in cmd.exe and you see an error like \"'gcloud' is not recognized...\" or \"python: not found\", it means the PATH is still NOT correctly set up at the system level, and gcloud cannot find Python even in the standard Windows command prompt. In this case, we need to go back and re-examine the Path variable settings again, VERY CAREFULLY for typos and correct ordering.\nIf gcloud --version WORKS in cmd.exe:\n\nTry running gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy from cmd.exe as administrator. Close the current cmd.exe window. Right-click on the \"Command Prompt\" shortcut and select \"Run as administrator\". Then, in the administrator cmd.exe window, run: gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy\nIf gcloud --version FAILS in cmd.exe:\n\nGo back to step 2 and RE-VERIFY your Path environment variable settings again, extremely carefully. Look for typos, incorrect paths, and incorrect ordering of paths. Make sure the Google Cloud SDK paths are definitely present and correctly spelled. Restart your computer again after any changes. Then re-test gcloud --version in cmd.exe.\nIt's CRUCIAL to get gcloud --version working in the standard cmd.exe first. This will tell us if the basic system-level PATH configuration for the Google Cloud SDK is correct.\n\nPlease go through these steps VERY CAREFULLY and methodically. Check your Path variable with extreme attention to detail, test in cmd.exe, and let me know the EXACT output of gcloud --version in cmd.exe, and if it works or fails.\n\nLet's get the PATH absolutely nailed down and tested in cmd.exe now! LFG! We are going to solve this PATH puzzle!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
