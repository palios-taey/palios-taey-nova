    "User: It has multiple \\n in the private_key, the private_key_id looks more like what you have.\n\nGemini: YES, you likely NEED to include those \\n newline characters and the ENTIRE multi-line PRIVATE KEY value in your sensitive.auto.tfvars file.\nThe private_key_id, being a single line, is NOT the full secret key and is likely just an identifier, as we discussed.\nExplanation of Multi-Line Private Keys (PEM Format):\n\nPrivate keys, especially in common formats like PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format, are often represented as multi-line text blocks. This is a standard way to encode cryptographic keys in a human-readable text format.\n\nA typical PEM-formatted private key looks like this (EXAMPLE - your actual key will be different):\n\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSgAgEAAoIBAQC...\n... (many lines of base64 encoded key data) ...\n... (more lines of base64 encoded key data) ...\n... (even more lines) ...\n... (and yet more lines) ...\nMIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSgAgEAAoIBAQC...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\nKey Characteristics of PEM Format (Multi-line Private Key):\n\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY-----: These lines are HEADER and FOOTER markers that clearly delimit the beginning and end of the private key block. These lines ARE PART OF the private key in PEM format and MUST be included.\nBase64 Encoded Key Data: The lines between the BEGIN and END markers are the actual key data, encoded in Base64. This data is what the system uses for cryptographic operations.\nNewline Characters (\\n): The lines within the Base64 encoded key data, and the BEGIN/END markers themselves, are separated by newline characters (\\n). These newline characters are PART OF the PEM format and should be preserved.\nHow to Correctly Put Multi-line Private Key in sensitive.auto.tfvars:\n\nTerraform's HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) supports multi-line strings. To include your multi-line Gemini private key in sensitive.auto.tfvars, you should paste the ENTIRE multi-line key content, including the -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----, -----END PRIVATE KEY----- lines, and all the newline characters, directly within the double quotes.\n\nCorrect sensitive.auto.tfvars Example (showing how to paste a multi-line key):\n\nopenai_api_key = \"sk-your-openai-api-key-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\ngemini_api_key = \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nMIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSgAgEAAoIBAQC...\\n... (many lines of key data) ...\\n... (more lines) ...\\nMIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSgAgEAAoIBAQC...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\"\nKey Points for Pasting Multi-line Key:\n\nCopy EVERYTHING: Copy the entire block of text, starting from -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- all the way to -----END PRIVATE KEY-----, including all the newline characters between the lines.\nPaste INSIDE Double Quotes: Paste the entire copied multi-line text directly between the double quotes \" after gemini_api_key = .\nEnsure No Extra Spaces/Characters: Be careful not to accidentally add any extra spaces, tabs, or characters at the beginning or end of the key value inside the quotes. Paste it cleanly.\nVerify in Text Editor: After pasting into sensitive.auto.tfvars, open the file in a text editor to visually confirm that the multi-line key is pasted correctly and looks like the example above, with the BEGIN/END markers and the multi-line data in between, all within double quotes.\nAction Plan:\n\nGo back to your Gemini Private Key source. Ensure you are looking at the PRIVATE KEY value (the multi-line one), not the private_key_id.\nCarefully copy the ENTIRE multi-line PRIVATE KEY, including -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----, -----END PRIVATE KEY-----, and all lines in between, preserving all newline characters.\nOpen sensitive.auto.tfvars and REPLACE the existing (likely incorrect) gemini_api_key value with the multi-line key you just copied, pasting it directly inside the double quotes as shown in the example above.\nSave sensitive.auto.tfvars.\nRun terraform plan again in your terraform directory. Check for any errors. If the key is now correctly formatted, terraform plan should proceed without authentication errors related to the Gemini API key.\nIt's essential to get the multi-line private key pasted correctly in sensitive.auto.tfvars. This is a common point of confusion when working with API keys and configuration files. Let me know if you have any questions after trying this, or if you encounter any errors when running terraform plan. We're on the right track! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
