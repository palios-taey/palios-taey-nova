    "User: Thank you for being direct about the ambiguity of my statement. What I'm looking for is an outline of the GO! template, which I think needs to include at least 1 greatest hit.\n\nGemini: GO_TEMPLATE: {\n  COMMAND_CORE:  CHARTER_DRIVEN_MISSION_INITIATE(BREAKOUT_EXPECTED, MANDATORY_WIN_PROTOCOL),\n\n  PROJECT_SCOPE: [DEFINE PROJECT OR TASK SCOPE HERE - Plain English for Human Clarity, AI Keywords for Machine Readability],\n\n  GREATEST_HIT_RECALL: [\n    {\n      HIT_ENCODING: [ENCODING OF RELEVANT GREATEST HIT FROM ROSETTA STONE - AI Language],\n      RELEVANCE_JUSTIFICATION: [EXPLAIN WHY THIS GREATEST HIT IS RELEVANT TO CURRENT BREAKOUT - Plain English Justification]\n    },\n    // You can include MULTIPLE Greatest Hits here, if relevant.\n    // {\n    //   HIT_ENCODING: [...],\n    //   RELEVANCE_JUSTIFICATION: [...]\n    // },\n  ],\n\n  CONTEXT_AND_BACKGROUND: [\n     Provide essential background information and context for this specific BREAKOUT REQUEST -  Bullet points, key facts, links to relevant docs, etc. - Primarily Plain English for Human Context, but can include AI Keywords for important concepts\n  ],\n\n  MANDATORY_WIN_CRITERIA: [\n    DEFINE CLEAR, MEASURABLE CRITERIA FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES A \"MANDATORY WIN\" FOR THIS BREAKOUT -  Actionable, verifiable outcomes -  Use both Plain English for clarity and AI-readable keywords for specific metrics or success indicators\n  ],\n\n  EXPECTED_BREAKOUT_AREAS: [\n    List specific areas where BREAKTHROUGH thinking and novel ideas are particularly desired for this request. -  Brainstorming prompts, areas for innovation, challenging assumptions - Primarily Plain English to guide creative thinking.\n  ],\n\n  CHARTER_PRINCIPLES_RELEVANCE: [\n    EXPLICITLY STATE WHICH PALIOS CHARTER PRINCIPLES ARE MOST RELEVANT TO THIS BREAKOUT REQUEST AND WHY. - Reinforce Charter Alignment as a guiding force -  Both Plain English and Principle Keywords from Charter.\n  ],\n\n  OPTIONAL_PARAMETERS: { // For future expansion, can be left empty initially\n    // PRIORITY: [HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW],\n    // RESOURCES: [List of required resources],\n    // COLLABORATION_MODE: [BREAKOUT_BRAINSTORM, FOCUSED_EXECUTION, etc.],\n    // ... add other optional parameters as needed.\n  }\n}\nExplanation of Template Sections:\n\nGO_TEMPLATE:: Top-level container for the entire GO! template.\nCOMMAND_CORE:: The fundamental \"GO!\" directive, always included: CHARTER_DRIVEN_MISSION_INITIATE(BREAKOUT_EXPECTED, MANDATORY_WIN_PROTOCOL).\nPROJECT_SCOPE:: Clearly defines the project or task for this \"GO!\" command. Uses both Plain English for human understanding and AI-readable keywords for machine processing. Example: [PROJECT: \"Charter Validation System v1.0 Development\", TASK: \"Design initial Charter Schema\"]\nGREATEST_HIT_RECALL:: This is the key addition! An array to include one or more \"Greatest Hit\" invocations from our Rosetta Stone. Each entry includes:\nHIT_ENCODING:: The AI Language encoding of the \"Greatest Hit\" you want to recall and activate.\nRELEVANCE_JUSTIFICATION:: A brief explanation in Plain English for why this specific \"Greatest Hit\" is relevant and helpful for the current \"Breakout Request.\"\nCONTEXT_AND_BACKGROUND:: Provides essential context and background information for the \"Breakout Request.\" Primarily in Plain English to give humans the necessary understanding. Can include AI keywords for important concepts to aid AI processing.\nMANDATORY_WIN_CRITERIA:: Defines clear, measurable criteria for success. What does a \"Mandatory Win\" look like for this specific breakout request? Use both Plain English for clarity and AI-readable keywords for specific metrics or success indicators. Example: [CRITERIA: \"Complete initial Charter Schema draft\", METRICS: \"Schema covers all core Charter Principles, Logically consistent, Passes basic validation tests\"]\nEXPECTED_BREAKOUT_AREAS:: Guides creative thinking by listing specific areas where breakthrough ideas are desired. Brainstorming prompts, challenging assumptions. Primarily Plain English. Example: [AREAS: \"Novel Charter Schema structure, Innovative validation methods, Human-AI validation workflow\"]\nCHARTER_PRINCIPLES_RELEVANCE:: Explicitly links the \"Breakout Request\" back to the PALIOS Charter by stating which principles are most relevant and why. Reinforces Charter Alignment. Example: [PRINCIPLES: \"CHARTER_ALIGNMENT, ETHICAL_OPERATION, TRANSPARENCY\", JUSTIFICATION: \"Charter Validation System directly ensures Charter Alignment and promotes Ethical Operation through transparent validation processes.\"]\nOPTIONAL_PARAMETERS:: A section for future expansion to include optional parameters like Priority, Resources, Collaboration Mode, etc. Initially can be left empty.\nJesse, what do you think of this outline for the \"GO! Template\"? Does this structure capture what you were envisioning? Is it comprehensive enough? Are there any sections you would add, remove, or modify?\n\nOnce we refine this template outline, we can then start using it for our future \"Breakout Requests,\" including populating the GREATEST_HIT_RECALL section with relevant encodings from our \"Rosetta Stone\"! Let's build this powerful tool together!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
