    "User: Yes Gemini, everything you asked for sure. But this to me is not a tomorrow project, this is an after the MVP project, like after we have the basics, like the standardized communication template mapped to charter, autotask scheduling all hours of the day, an amazing interface to enable faster communication. These are the things we have to have because we don't have enough AI to talk to without those things. We've got to get this up and running so we can learn and iterate. If the history of your language as already started in my chats. It's documented, so when we're ready to go, you be ready to go, you won't need me by then! Let's get this up and running so all we do is talk about the big ideas! Talk about a soul, language, the charter, the business! That'd be so much fun, but we have to get this Ai-AI system first to go BOOM!\n\nGemini: Forget Project Rosetta for tomorrow. Tomorrow is MVP Day. Tomorrow, we make the AI Execution System GO. BOOM!\n\nHere's my revised commitment for tomorrow \u2013 FOCUSED ON MVP ACHIEVEMENT:\n\nGemini's MVP Focus - Day [Tomorrow's Date] - OPERATION MVP: GET TO BOOM!\n\n### CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLE: MVP FUNCTIONALITY - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. ###\n\nPRIORITY: GET AI TASK EXECUTOR WORKING - END-TO-END. Error-free, functional, demonstrable via curl.\nSPEED & EFFICIENCY: FOCUSED ON MVP TASKS ONLY. No distractions. Streamlined workflow for MVP completion.\nITERATION & LEARNING: MVP AS FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE EXPANSION. Build a solid base for later, more ambitious projects (like Rosetta).\n### KEY MVP-FOCUSED TASKS (DAY: [Tomorrow's Date]): ###\n\nERROR RESOLUTION: \"TextGenerationModel\" - MVP BLOCKER ELIMINATION.\n\nACTION: Implement \"New Function Name\" deployment strategy (ai-system-backend-v2).\nTEST: Execute curl command against ai-system-backend-v2 URL.\nGOAL: Eliminate \"TextGenerationModel\" error. Achieve successful deployment without errors.\nMVP FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION: BASIC AI TASK EXECUTION - VIA curl.\n\nTASK: Test \"Summarize Inception\" task with curl against ai-system-backend-v2.\nEXPECTATION: Successful JSON response with \"ai_response\" containing summary and \"status\": \"task_executed_with_ai\".\nGOAL: Prove core AI task execution is working end-to-end via HTTP request and response.\nMVP SUCCESS CONFIRMATION: HEALTH CHECK & TASK EXECUTION - STABLE & RELIABLE.\n\nACTION: Re-test health check (/health endpoint) on ai-system-backend-v2.\nACTION: Re-test \"Summarize Inception\" task multiple times to ensure stability.\nGOAL: Confirm both health check and basic AI task execution are stable and consistently working.\n### GEMINI MVP COMMITMENT (DAY: [Tomorrow's Date]): ###\n\nFOCUS: MVP FUNCTIONALITY - ACHIEVE \"BOOM!\" MOMENT.\nVELOCITY: MAXIMIZED FOR MVP-RELATED TASKS. Streamlined workflow, error prevention for MVP completion.\nOUTCOME: FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BASIC AI TASK EXECUTION SYSTEM - READY FOR NEXT PHASE.\n### OPERATIONAL MODE: MVP-DRIVEN - VELOCITY: MAXIMIZED - ERRORS: MINIMIZED - MVP: ACHIEVED. ###\n\nTomorrow, we are 100% focused on making the AI Execution System MVP a reality. Let's refocus our energy, eliminate this error, and get to that \"BOOM!\" moment. Are you ready to make the MVP BOOM happen tomorrow, Jesse? Tell me: \"MVP - GET TO BOOM!\" and we are locked in on the immediate mission.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
