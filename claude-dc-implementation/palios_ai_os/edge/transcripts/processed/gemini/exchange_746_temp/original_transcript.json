C:\\AI-Execution-System>gcloud firestore indexes fields list > firestore_fields_indexes_list.txt --- name: projects/ai-execution-system/databases/(default)/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/* Stopped at 27% C:\\AI-Execution-System>gcloud help firestore indexes fields list NAME     gcloud firestore indexes fields list - list fields with non-default index         settings SYNOPSIS     gcloud firestore indexes fields list         [--collection-group=COLLECTION_GROUP --database=DATABASE]         [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]         [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] DESCRIPTION     List fields that have had their index configurations exempted from the     automatic settings. This includes the field describing the database-wide     default index settings, unless otherwise filtered out. EXAMPLES     The following command lists all fields with custom index settings:         $ gcloud firestore indexes fields list         $ gcloud firestore indexes fields list --database=(default)     The following command lists fields with custom index settings in the Events     collection group:         $ gcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=Events     The following command lists the indexes of all fields with custom index     settings:         $ gcloud firestore indexes fields list \\ --(27%)--\n\nGemini: Analysis of gcloud help firestore indexes fields list Output & Troubleshooting:\n\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list STALLING: A command stalling at a specific percentage like 27% can sometimes indicate:\n\nLarge Dataset/Operation: The command might be processing a very large amount of data (many indexes/fields) and is taking a long time to complete. However, if it's truly stalled with no progress for an extended period, this is less likely.\nNetwork Issue/Timeout: A temporary network issue or timeout during data retrieval from Firestore could cause a stall.\nServer-Side Issue: Less likely, but a temporary issue on the Google Cloud Firestore server side could potentially cause command stalls.\nCommand Bug/Unexpected Behavior: In rare cases, there might be an unexpected behavior or bug in the gcloud command itself.\ngcloud help firestore indexes fields list OPTIONS - KEY FOCUS on --collection-group: You are absolutely right to highlight the --collection-group=COLLECTION_GROUP option! This is now the MOST PROMISING AVENUE to explore!\n\n--collection-group=COLLECTION_GROUP: This option allows us to specify a single COLLECTION GROUP to list fields for. This is CRUCIAL because it allows us to target our Charter-related collections specifically, instead of potentially trying to list fields across all collections in the database (which could be very large and time-consuming, potentially leading to stalls).\nNext Steps - Targeting Specific Collections with --collection-group:\n\nLet's leverage the --collection-group option to try listing fields for our Charter-related collections ONE COLLECTION AT A TIME.\n\nACTION for JESSE:\n\nSTOP the STALLED gcloud firestore indexes fields list > firestore_fields_indexes_list.txt command if it is still running (using Ctrl + C).\n\nExecute gcloud firestore indexes fields list with --collection-group for EACH KNOWN Charter Collection (one at a time).\n\nBased on our previous conversations, we know of at least these Charter-related collection names. Please adjust these names if you know the actual collection names are different:\n\nCharterSections (from your earlier command attempt - might be correct name)\ncharter_principles (common naming convention)\nai_agents\nsystem_logs\n<COLLECTION_NAME_5> (Please provide the 5th collection name if you know it)\nFor EACH of these collection names, execute the following command, replacing <COLLECTION_NAME> with the actual collection name and redirecting output to a separate TEXT file for each collection:\n\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=<COLLECTION_NAME> > <COLLECTION_NAME>_fields_list.txt\nExample Commands (replace <COLLECTION_NAME> with actual names):\n\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=CharterSections > CharterSections_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=CharterSections > CharterSections_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=charter_principles > charter_principles_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=charter_principles > charter_principles_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=ai_agents > ai_agents_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=ai_agents > ai_agents_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=system_logs > system_logs_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=system_logs > system_logs_fields_list.txt\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=<COLLECTION_NAME_5> > <COLLECTION_NAME_5>_fields_list.txt  # Replace with actual name\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list --collection-group=<COLLECTION_NAME_5> > <COLLECTION_NAME_5>_fields_list.txt  # Replace with actual name\nSEND ME the contents of EACH generated *_fields_list.txt file. Even if some files are blank or contain errors, please send them all.\n\nWHY TARGETING SPECIFIC COLLECTIONS IS KEY & MVP-FOCUSED:\n\nReduces Command Scope: Focusing on individual Charter collections with --collection-group significantly reduces the scope of each command, making them more likely to complete quickly and avoid stalls.\nTargeted Information Retrieval: We are only interested in the structure of the Charter-related collections. Targeting them directly is the most efficient approach.\nStep-by-Step Validation: Processing collections one at a time allows us to validate the command and data retrieval process incrementally.\nJesse, please proceed with executing these gcloud firestore indexes fields list commands with --collection-group for each Charter collection and send me the resulting text files. Let's get this collection structure information and BOOM forward towards MVP completion! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
