It might be the same URL as before, or it could be a slightly different URL if Google Cloud re-deploys to a new instance.\n\nAFTER DEPLOYMENT COMPLETES and you have the FUNCTION URL, PLEASE REPORT BACK:\n\n\"RE-RUNNING gcloud functions deploy command...\" (When you start the command).\nTERMINAL OUTPUT DURING DEPLOYMENT: (Copy and paste the entire terminal output - just like you did before).\n\"CLOUD FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL (again)!\" (If you see the \"Function 'ai-system-backend' deployed.\" and \"Function URL\" message).\n\"NEW FUNCTION URL: [paste the new Function URL here]\" (Paste the Function URL from the terminal output).\nAFTER DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS, we will TEST THE HEALTH CHECK URL AGAIN in your browser to make sure it still works after the code update.\n\nTHEN, we will plan the next steps for testing the NEW execute_task function!\n\nLET'S DEPLOY THE UPDATED CLOUD FUNCTION! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
