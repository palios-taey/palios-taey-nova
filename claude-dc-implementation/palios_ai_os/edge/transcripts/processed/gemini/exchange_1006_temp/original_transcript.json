You're trying to go back to Google Provider version 6.20.0, but I'm currently using version 6.23.0 (which is recorded in my lock file .terraform.lock.hcl). If you really want to downgrade, you need to tell me explicitly by running terraform init -upgrade.\"\n\nThis is Terraform's safety mechanism to prevent accidental provider version changes.\n\nSolution: Run terraform init -upgrade command NOW\n\nIn your Git Bash terminal, in the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform directory, run this command EXACTLY:\n\nterraform init -upgrade\nWhat terraform init -upgrade does:\n\nUpgrades (or in this case, DOWNGRADES) provider versions: The -upgrade flag tells Terraform to ignore the existing lock file and re-resolve provider versions based on your configuration (including versions.tf). In this case, it will force Terraform to use Google Provider version 6.20.0 as you specified in versions.tf.\nUpdates the lock file .terraform.lock.hcl: After successfully resolving the provider versions, Terraform will update the .terraform.lock.hcl file to record the newly selected provider versions (in this case, Google Provider 6.20.0).\nAfter running terraform init -upgrade, you should then run terraform plan again.\n\nSteps NOW:\n\nRun terraform init -upgrade in Git Bash.\nWait for terraform init -upgrade to complete successfully. Observe the output to make sure it completes without errors and indicates it's using Google Provider version 6.20.0.\nRun terraform plan in Git Bash immediately after terraform init -upgrade.\nObserve the output of terraform plan. Check if the \"Unsupported block type\" error for retry_config is GONE this time!\nPlease run terraform init -upgrade and then terraform plan and provide the COMPLETE output of both commands!\n\nLet's see if this provider version adjustment resolves the retry_config error! We are pushing through these last configuration hurdles! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
