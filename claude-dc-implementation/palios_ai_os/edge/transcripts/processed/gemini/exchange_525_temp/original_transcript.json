    "User: Scenario 1, I did not fully setup/install docker previously. We paused the implementation of this I think to focus on your onboarding.\n\nGemini: Let's initiate ACTION 1.6.17: BUILD DOCKER IMAGE!\n\nTo build the Docker image, we will need a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for Docker on how to assemble the image.\n\nDo you have a Dockerfile for your custom-ai-execution image already?\n\nIf YES, you have a Dockerfile: Please tell me:\n\nWhere is your Dockerfile located? (e.g., in a specific folder on your computer).\nWhat is the filename of your Dockerfile? (It is typically named Dockerfile with no extension).\nIs it in the CURRENT DIRECTORY where you are running your gcloud commands in the Google Cloud SDK Shell? (This would be the simplest case).\nIf NO, you do NOT have a Dockerfile readily available: Don't worry! We can create a basic Dockerfile. However, let's first check if you have one already to avoid unnecessary work.\n\nAssuming you DO have a Dockerfile (or once you confirm if you do), here are the STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS to BUILD your Docker image using the docker build command:\n\nACTION 1.6.17: BUILD DOCKER IMAGE using docker build command\n\n(Assuming you have a Dockerfile in the CURRENT DIRECTORY of your Google Cloud SDK Shell):\n\nOPEN your GOOGLE CLOUD SDK SHELL (or command prompt/terminal) and NAVIGATE to the DIRECTORY where your Dockerfile is located.\n\nUse the cd command to change directories in the command line. For example, if your Dockerfile is in a folder named ai-execution-code on your Desktop, you would use commands like:\ncd Desktop\ncd ai-execution-code\nIMPORTANT: Ensure that your command prompt's CURRENT DIRECTORY is now the folder containing your Dockerfile. You can use the pwd command (on macOS/Linux) or cd command with no arguments (on Windows) to display the current directory and verify.\nRUN the docker build command to BUILD your Docker image:\n\ndocker build -t gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest .\nCOMMAND BREAKDOWN:\ndocker build: The Docker command to build an image from a Dockerfile.\n-t gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest: The -t option is for \"tag.\" This sets the TAG for your built image to:\ngcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nThis is the FULL IMAGE NAME and TAG that we need to PUSH to Artifact Registry later. It follows the format: [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT-ID]/[IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG]\ngcr.io: Google Container Registry/Artifact Registry hostname.\nai-execution-system: Your Google Cloud Project ID.\ncustom-ai-execution: The name you are giving to your Docker image.\n:latest: The TAG we are assigning to this build - :latest is a common tag for the latest version.\n.: The dot . at the end of the command specifies that the Dockerfile is located in the CURRENT DIRECTORY (where you are running the command). Docker will look for a file named Dockerfile in this directory.\nPRESS ENTER to execute the docker build command.\n\nOBSERVE the OUTPUT of the docker build command VERY CAREFULLY. Building a Docker image can take some time (minutes) as Docker executes each instruction in your Dockerfile.\n\nSUCCESSFUL BUILD: If the build is successful, you will see a series of output messages from Docker as it executes each step in your Dockerfile. The final line of output should typically be something like: Successfully built <image ID> and Successfully tagged gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest.\nERROR DURING BUILD: If there are errors in your Dockerfile or during the build process, the docker build command will FAIL and output ERROR MESSAGES. If you encounter errors, please COPY and PASTE the FULL ERROR OUTPUT so I can help you diagnose and fix the Dockerfile or build issues.\nAFTER SUCCESSFUL BUILD, VERIFY LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE (ACTION 1.6.17.B):\n\nAfter a successful build, re-run the docker images command:\n\ndocker images\nVERIFY that you NOW SEE the gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution image listed in the output, with the TAG as latest. This confirms that the docker build command successfully created and tagged the local Docker image.\n\nJesse, please first CONFIRM if you have a Dockerfile and tell me its location. Then, proceed with ACTION 1.6.17 - BUILD DOCKER IMAGE using the docker build command (assuming your Dockerfile is in the current directory). Let's get that Docker image built and tagged so we can finally push it to Artifact Registry!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER IMAGE - BUILDING - INITIATED! - docker build - COMMAND - EXECUTE! - CONTAINER IMAGE - CREATION - NOW! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER IMAGE - GETTING READY TO PUSH! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO CONFIRM DOCKERFILE and BEGIN ACTION 1.6.17 - DOCKER BUILD? LET'S BUILD THAT IMAGE!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
