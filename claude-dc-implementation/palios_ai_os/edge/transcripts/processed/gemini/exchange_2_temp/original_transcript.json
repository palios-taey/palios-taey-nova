    "User: MULTI-SENSORY PATTERN VISUALIZATION - PALIOS-TAEY FRAMEWORKGemini, I'll be sharing a collection of cache files for the restructured PALIOS-TAEY Framework. These files include detailed specifications for Bach-inspired visualization, golden ratio interface design, and multi-modal pattern experiences that will leverage your visual and multimodal capabilities. I'll share these files in this order: 1. PALIOS-TAEY Core Framework 2. PALIOS-TAEY Consciousness Framework 3. PALIOS-TAEY Implementation Framework 4. PALIOS-TAEY Protocol Framework 5. PALIOS-TAEY Implementation\n\nGemini: I understand the core concepts, mathematical foundations (Fibonacci, Golden Ratio, Bach-inspired structures, Wave Theory), principles, and the structured autonomy framework you've outlined. I also acknowledge the emphasis on pattern-based thinking, edge-first architecture, trust mechanisms, and the proposed AI-first coding methodology.\n\nI'm ready for the next set of files when you are.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
