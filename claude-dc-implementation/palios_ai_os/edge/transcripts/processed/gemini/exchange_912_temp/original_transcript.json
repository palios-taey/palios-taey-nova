    "User: Thank you for providing both response formats and the detailed project context. Let me first address your question about communication formats: The ai-ai.json format has several advantages: More structured and machine-parseable Clear delineation of different context components Easier to validate completeness of information Could enable automated processing in the future However, it also has some limitations: Less natural for human reading and quick scanning May obscure important nuances that prose can better convey Could become overly rigid or complex as needs evolve I would suggest a hybrid approach: Use structured JSON for core technical specifications and configuration Use prose format for discussions, clarifications, and context Include clearly formatted code blocks for implementation examples Now, let me provide the revised code based on your project context. coreProtocol.ts Click to open code Tap to open I apologize for the error in my function call.

CONTINUED IN NEXT SUBMISSION\n\nGemini: To ensure absolute clarity and resolve potential module issues, the most robust approach now is to:\n\nExplicitly Export Interfaces from coreProtocol.ts: Forcefully ensure TestConfig, CharterTestResult, and all other interfaces needed in integration-tests.ts are explicitly exported from coreProtocol.ts.\nExplicitly Import Interfaces in integration-tests.ts with Relative Paths: Use clear, relative import paths in integration-tests.ts to import the necessary interfaces from coreProtocol.ts. This eliminates ambiguity in module resolution.\nProvide Both coreProtocol.ts and integration-tests.ts Together Again: Re-deliver both files to guarantee they are consistent and intended to work together. This avoids any possibility of code drift or mismatched file versions.\nClear, Sequential, and Detailed Implementation Steps: Provide extremely clear, step-by-step instructions, including commands to create/replace both files and run npm run build.\nAssume User is Starting Fresh (If Necessary): Implicitly suggest that the user might need to ensure a clean compilation by deleting the dist folder if issues persist (though this should hopefully not be necessary with proper exports/imports).\nConfidence Score: 5/5 (High Confidence) - This approach, with explicit exports and imports and re-delivery of both files together, should eliminate the interface visibility issues and resolve the compilation errors.\n\nLet's generate the code and instructions with this \"bulletproof\" approach.\n\nHere are BOTH the coreProtocol.ts and integration-tests.ts files together again, with EXPLICIT EXPORTS and IMPORTS to guarantee interface visibility.\n\n1. coreProtocol.ts (UPDATED - EXPLICIT EXPORTS):\n\n/**\n * coreProtocol.ts - Defines the core protocol interfaces and implementation.\n */\n\nexport interface TestConfig { // EXPLICITLY EXPORTED\n    retryAttempts: number;\n}\n\nexport interface PerformanceMetrics { // EXPLICITLY EXPORTED\n    averageDuration: number;\n    totalMemoryUsage: number;\n}\n\nexport interface TestResult { // EXPLICITLY EXPORTED\n    success: boolean;\n    name: string;\n    duration: number;\n    memoryUsage: number;\n    performanceMetrics?: PerformanceMetrics;\n    error?: any;\n}\n\nexport interface CharterValidationResult extends TestResult { // EXPLICITLY EXPORTED\n    charterCompliance: boolean;\n    violations?: string[];\n    confidenceScore?: number;\n}\n\nexport interface CharterTestResult extends CharterValidationResult { // EXPLICITLY EXPORTED\n    charterAspect: string;

Implementation Steps - PLEASE FOLLOW EXACTLY:\n\nCreate coreProtocol.ts:\n\necho \"// Content from coreProtocol.ts artifact\" > coreProtocol.ts\n(This command will create or overwrite coreProtocol.ts with the code from the \"Core Protocol Implementation\" artifact above)\n\nCreate integration-tests.ts:\n\necho \"// Content from integration-tests.ts artifact\" > integration-tests.ts\n(This command will create or overwrite integration-tests.ts with the code from the \"Integration Tests Implementation\" artifact above)\n\nRun the Build Command:\n\nnpm run build\n4. Check for Compilation Errors:\n\nCarefully examine the output of npm run build.\nIf you see \"0 errors\" or a similar success message, the compilation is likely successful.\nIf you see any errors, please COPY and PASTE the entire error output back to me. Do not just describe the error, provide the full error message. This is critical for precise troubleshooting.\n5. Run the Tests (After Successful Compilation): bash node dist/integration-tests.js\n\nLet me know the output of npm run build first. If it compiles cleanly, then run the tests and share that output as well. Let's get this working! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
