The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable within the allocated timeout. This can happen when the container port is misconfigured or if the timeout is too short. The health check timeout can be extended. Logs for this revision might contain more information.

Service URL: Health endpoint: /health Task endpoint: /task \u2713 Deployment script execution completed.\n\nGemini: Please open your Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ in a text editor (like Notepad or Sublime Text) and VERIFY that the VERY FIRST LINE is EXACTLY:\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\nIt MUST be exactly this, with no extra spaces, no typos, no extra characters before or after \"FROM python:3.9-slim-buster\".\n\nCommon mistakes to check for:\n\nTypo in python or 3.9-slim-buster: Double-check the spelling and version.\nExtra spaces before or after FROM or python:3.9-slim-buster: Make sure there are no leading or trailing spaces.\nInvisible characters: Sometimes text editors can introduce invisible characters. Try deleting the entire first line and re-typing it from scratch: FROM python:3.9-slim-buster\nIncorrect line endings: (Less likely, but possible) Ensure the line ending is a standard line break (LF or CRLF).\nPlease CAREFULLY CHECK the VERY FIRST LINE of your Dockerfile and make sure it is EXACTLY FROM python:3.9-slim-buster.\n\nOnce you have verified and corrected the first line of your Dockerfile if needed, please run the universal-deploy-script.sh command AGAIN:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nLet me know if correcting the Dockerfile FIRST LINE resolves the \"dockerfile parse error\" and if the build process proceeds further this time!\n\nThis Dockerfile syntax error is preventing the Docker image from even building, so we need to fix this FIRST! Let's get that FROM line perfect! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
