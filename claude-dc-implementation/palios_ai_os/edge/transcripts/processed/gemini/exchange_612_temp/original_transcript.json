    "User: It worked! The response was so long it cut off.\n\nGemini: FIRST, LET'S GET THE FULL STORY OUTPUT:\n\nCHECK YOUR TERMINAL SCROLLBACK BUFFER: Your terminal might have a scrollback buffer. Try scrolling up in your terminal window to see if you can see the entire story output. Sometimes, terminals just don't display all of a very long output at once, but it might still be in the buffer.\nIF TERMINAL BUFFER IS LIMITED: If you can't find the full story in your terminal scrollback, don't worry too much right now. We've confirmed it's working, and we can improve output handling later. For now, the important thing is that the AI system generated the full story and subtask results, even if your terminal didn't display everything.\nNEXT, LET'S VERIFY THE DATA IN FIRESTORE:\n\nPlease go to your Firebase Console and check Firestore for the following:\n\nTASKS COLLECTION:\n\nFind the task with Task ID: ad63a85f-53b0-4241-9076-7dc6781e15ea.\nVERIFY:\nThe status field is set to completed.\nThere is a result_id field (it might be None in the output you pasted, but check Firestore directly - it should have a Result ID now that the task is completed - 4c1a5ac5-f6d2-4115-bfc3-7b33956104ad).\nThe subtasks array is present and contains the details of the decomposed subtasks (objectives, statuses, assigned models, etc.).\nRESULTS COLLECTION:\n\nFind the result with Result ID: 4c1a5ac5-f6d2-4115-bfc3-7b33956104ad.\nVERIFY:\nThe task_id matches ad63a85f-53b0-4241-9076-7dc6781e15ea.\nThe final_result field contains the full story text (or at least a significant portion of it if it's very long).\nThe subtask_results field contains an array of the subtask results, matching the subtasks you saw in the Task document.\nEXECUTIONS COLLECTION:\n\nCheck the executions collection for a new document related to the collaborative task execution. You can look for executions with:\ntask_id: ad63a85f-53b0-4241-9076-7dc6781e15ea\nstatus:completed\nREPORT BACK ON FIRESTORE VERIFICATION:\n\nLet me know what you find in Firestore for the Task, Result, and Execution documents related to the collaborative task. Specifically confirm:\n\nTask ad63a85f-53b0-4241-9076-7dc6781e15ea status is completed and has a result_id.\nResult 4c1a5ac5-f6d2-4115-bfc3-7b33956104ad exists and contains final_result and subtask_results.\nONCE WE CONFIRM FIRESTORE DATA, WE WILL HAVE CONCLUSIVELY PROVEN THAT COLLABORATIVE TASKS ARE WORKING END-TO-END!\n\nTHEN, WE CELEBRATE THIS MAJOR MVP ACHIEVEMENT and PLAN THE NEXT MVP FEATURE!\n\nLET'S GO! CHECK FIRESTORE AND REPORT BACK! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
