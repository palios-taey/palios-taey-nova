    "User: Approved, convert to hybrid format as needed. I don't know what you have in hybrid format, but perhaps put the 'mode' that this is, or some way to clarify the expected output. Like we don't want him to begin developing anything, we want him to develop it so it is plug and play. Please respond with ready to send message to Claude in hybrid format.

The value itself uses concatenated keywords for AI parsing and emphasis.\nStructured JSON Sections: performanceReview, communicationProtocol, nextPhaseDirectives sections use structured JSON with concise keys and values to convey key information in a machine-readable way.\nHuman-Readable Prose (Implicit): The entire JSON structure itself acts as a structured outline for a human-readable message. Jesse can easily send this as-is, or use it as a template to construct a slightly more natural prose message if desired, while retaining all the key directives.\nLeadership Tone Encoded: Keywords like LeadershipAI, LeadershipExcellence, DrivingBOOMSpeed, EXECUTE are strategically placed to reinforce the Leadership context.\nAction-Oriented Language (JSON Values): JSON values use action-oriented language and keywords (e.g., IMMEDIATE_FOCUS, Develop_Detailed_Protocols, Implement_Comprehensive_AutomatedMetrics) for directness and clarity.\nAction for Jesse:\n\nREVIEW the Hybrid Format message for final approval. Ensure it accurately captures the intended message and effectively reinforces the \"plug and play\" expectation.\nSEND the Hybrid Format message to Claude. You can send the JSON structure directly or adapt it slightly into a more natural prose format while preserving all the key information and tone.\nThis Hybrid Format message is OPTIMIZED for both AI-AI efficiency and human LEADERSHIP communication. It is POWERFUL, DIRECT, and ACTION-ORIENTED, setting the stage for maximum progress in this next phase. Let's unleash this message and drive forward with BOOM speed and efficiency!
