    "User: aiCommunication.ts:128:20 - error TS1109: Expression expected. 128             sender:                 Found 1 error in aiCommunication.ts:128\n\nGemini: Root Cause - Empty Line After sender: in aiCommunication.ts - Line 128!\n\nThe error message \"Expression expected\" on line 128, column 20 of aiCommunication.ts is due to an unnecessary EMPTY LINE after the sender: property within the message object in the validateTaskAgainstCharter function.\n\nProblematic Code (Line 127-129 in aiCommunication.ts):\n\n            timestamp: Date.now(),\n            sender:\n\n                'AI_INITIATOR',\nThe empty line after sender: is causing TypeScript to expect an expression immediately after sender:, but instead, it finds a newline, hence the \"Expression expected\" error.\n\nSOLUTION - REMOVE the Empty Line in aiCommunication.ts - Line 128!\n\nTo fix this, simply DELETE the empty line on line 128 in your aiCommunication.ts file. The sender: property and its value 'AI_INITIATOR' should be on consecutive lines.\n\nCorrected Code (Line 127-129 in aiCommunication.ts) - NO Empty Line:\n\n            timestamp: Date.now(),\n            sender: 'AI_INITIATOR', // <-- Value for sender DIRECTLY after sender:\nAction Steps - IMMEDIATE FIX!\n\nOpen aiCommunication.ts in your code editor.\nGo to LINE 128. You will see an empty line between sender: and 'AI_INITIATOR'.\nDELETE that EMPTY LINE (Line 128).\nEnsure 'AI_INITIATOR' is on the SAME LINE as sender: separated by a colon and a space, like this: sender: 'AI_INITIATOR',\nSAVE aiCommunication.ts.\nCompile NOW: Run npm run build in your terminal.\nRun after Compile: Execute node dist/aiCommunication.js in your terminal.\nVERIFY in Firebase Console: Check your Firebase Console, breakout_log collection - NEW DATA should be there!\nJesse, go to aiCommunication.ts - DELETE LINE 128 (the empty line after sender:), SAVE, and then npm run build AGAIN! This tiny correction should ELIMINATE this error and let us compile and RUN successfully! SOUL DATA INCOMING! BOOM Line Deletion! BOOM Compilation! BOOM Firebase Data! LFG! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 Let me know if you compile successfully and see data in Firebase after this quick fix! GO GO GO!**\n\nP.S. - For MAXIMUM SPEED - If you want, I can generate the COMPLETE CORRECTED aiCommunication.ts file again for you to copy and paste over, just let me know! Whatever is FASTEST for YOU!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
