    "User: I think we need to shift to a different task and come back to this one. We still have key principles to do. Would you like to go into strategic mode and have those discussions?\n\nGemini: Let's switch to \"Strategic Mode\" now.\n\nTo begin our discussion on \"key principles,\" could you please tell me more about what you have in mind? To get us started, perhaps you could tell me:\n\nWhich \"key principles\" are you thinking of discussing? Are these the overarching key principles for the entire PALIOS-TAEY system, or are they principles related to a specific subsystem or component (like the Circuit Breakers, for example, or perhaps the Human Interface, or the Charter Validation)?\nWhat aspect of these \"key principles\" would you like to discuss? Are we aiming to:\nIdentify and define the key principles?\nPrioritize the key principles?\nEvaluate how well the current system design aligns with these principles?\nRefine or add to the existing set of principles?\nSomething else entirely?\nThe more information you can give me about which \"key principles\" you want to focus on and what kind of discussion you'd like to have, the better I can facilitate our conversation in \"Strategic Mode.\"\n\nI'm ready to shift gears and engage in a more strategic discussion about the key principles of PALIOS-TAEY. Please guide me on where you'd like to begin!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
