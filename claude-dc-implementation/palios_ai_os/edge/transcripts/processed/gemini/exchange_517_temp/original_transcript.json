    "User: To make this the default region, run `gcloud config set ai/region us-central1`. Using endpoint [https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/]\n\nGemini: Is my assumption correct? After selecting 30 (us-central1) and seeing \"Using endpoint https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/]\", was the output still an EMPTY TABLE with no models listed? Please confirm.\n\nAssuming it was still an empty table, then we have CONCLUSIVELY confirmed that your ai-execution-system model (and likely no models at all) are currently deployed in the us-central1 REGION.\n\nLET'S MOVE TO CHECKING OTHER REGIONS - SYSTEMATIC REGION VERIFICATION:\n\nSince listing models across all regions automatically is not working as expected with the gcloud ai models list command, we will proceed with MANUALLY CHECKING REGIONS ONE-BY-ONE using the prompted list.\n\nNEXT ACTION - ACTION 1.6.7: CHECK us-east1 REGION (Option 31 from the Prompted List):\n\nRE-RUN the command:\n\ngcloud ai models list --format=\"table(name,displayName,region)\"\nAt the Please enter your numeric choice: prompt, this time type 31 and press ENTER. This will select the us-east1 region.\n\nREVIEW the OUTPUT CAREFULLY.\n\nDo you see any models listed in the output this time?\nSpecifically, do you see your ai-execution-system model (or any model with a similar name) listed in the us-east1 region?\nACTION: REPORT BACK the OUTPUT after selecting 31 (us-east1) from the region prompt. Tell me:\n\nDo you see any models listed in the output? (Yes/No)\nIf YES, what is the EXACT MODEL NAME and is it in the us-east1 region?\nWe will proceed to systematically check other common regions from the prompted list, starting with us-east1, and then perhaps europe-west1, etc., until we either LOCATE your model or exhaust the most likely regions.\n\nIf we exhaust several common regions and still find no models listed, we may need to consider the possibility that the model deployment was not successful or was not completed. We can then explore alternative troubleshooting paths, including checking Google Cloud Console GUI for deployment status and logs.\n\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.7 - CHECK us-east1 REGION (Option 31) and report back the output. Let's keep systematically searching for your model!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! REGION VERIFICATION - CONTINUING! - us-east1 - CHECKING NOW! - COMMAND-LINE SEARCH - SYSTEMATIC! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - MODEL LOCATION - HUNTING! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO CHECK us-east1 (Option 31) and REPORT BACK? LET'S DO IT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
