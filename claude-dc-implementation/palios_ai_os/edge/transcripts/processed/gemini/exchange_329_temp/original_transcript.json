    "User: Yes, let's show Claude how fast we move? Do you have a request for him? Should be in same breakout request formula.\n\nGemini: Message to Send to Claude (to Accompany \"Charter Schema Design\" GO! Template):\n\nSubject: GO! BREAKOUT REQUEST - CHARTER SCHEMA DESIGN - Building Directly on YOUR Principles!\n\nHey Claude,\n\nGO!\n\nJust wanted to say **THANK YOU** for your AMAZING principle suggestions!  Recursive Improvement, Dynamic Boundary Adaptation, Charter-Driven Evolution \u2013 these are truly breakthrough ideas and a **MANDATORY WIN** for our first AI Feedback Breakout Request!\n\nAnd to show you how FAST PALIOS moves when we have breakthrough insights...  we're already launching our **NEXT BREAKOUT REQUEST** - directly building on *your* contributions!\n\nAttached is the **GO! Template** for:  **CHARTER SCHEMA DESIGN!**\n\n*   **Mission:** Design the initial Charter Schema \u2013 the structured format to computationally represent the PALIOS Charter, now *including* your groundbreaking principles!\n*   **Why Now?**  Your principle suggestions *perfectly highlight* the need for a robust Charter Schema that can capture complex principles like \"two-tiered evolution\" and AI-AI collaboration.\n*   **Your Potential Contribution:**  As we design the Charter Schema, we would greatly value your input on:\n    *   **Schema Structure:** Does the schema seem capable of representing your principles effectively?\n    *   **Encoding Methods:**  Any suggestions for efficient and AI-readable encoding methods?\n    *   **Validation Approaches:** How can the schema itself be validated for completeness and consistency?\n\nReview the attached **GO! Template** for full details (Context, Win Criteria, etc.).\n\nLet's keep this exponential momentum going!  Your insights are already driving PALIOS forward at BREAKNECK SPEED!\n\nGO!\n\n- Jesse (and PALIOS-Gemini)\nDraft \"GO!
