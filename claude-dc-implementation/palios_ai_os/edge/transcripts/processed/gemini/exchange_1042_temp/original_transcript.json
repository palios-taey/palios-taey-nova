Close all terminal windows for now.\n\nOpen the Windows \"System Environment Variables\" settings:\n\nPress the Windows key and type: environment variables\nSelect \"Edit the system environment variables\" from the search results.\nThe \"System Properties\" window will open. Click the \"Environment Variables...\" button at the bottom.\nThe \"Environment Variables\" window will open.\nIn the \"System variables\" section (bottom part of the window), scroll down and find the variable named Path (or PATH).\n\nSelect the Path variable and click \"Edit...\"\nThe \"Edit environment variable\" window will open, showing a list of paths. You need to make sure the following paths related to Google Cloud SDK are present in this list, and in the CORRECT ORDER:\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: The Google Cloud SDK bin directory MUST be listed. It should look something like this (adjust if your installation path is different): C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin\n\nIt's also good to have the bundled Python directory in the PATH as well, although the bin directory should be sufficient if set up correctly: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\platform\\bundledpython\\\n\nMake sure these Google Cloud SDK paths are listed EARLIER in the list than any other Python installations you might have on your system. If you have other Python paths listed, the Google Cloud SDK paths should generally come before them.\n\nIf the Google Cloud SDK paths are MISSING or INCORRECT:\n\nClick \"New\" and add the missing paths EXACTLY as shown above (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin and optionally C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\platform\\bundledpython\\).\nIf a path is incorrect, select it and click \"Edit...\" to correct it.\nIf a Google Cloud SDK path is listed lower than other Python paths, use the \"Move Up\" button to move the Google Cloud SDK paths higher in the list.\nIMPORTANT: After making any changes to the Path variable, click \"OK\" in the \"Edit environment variable\" window, then \"OK\" in the \"Environment Variables\" window, and finally \"OK\" in the \"System Properties\" window to save your changes.\n\nRESTART YOUR COMPUTER. This is CRITICAL! Environment variable changes often only fully take effect after a system restart. Restart your Windows computer.\n\nAfter restarting, open a new MINGW64 terminal window (you don't need to run as administrator this time, just a regular terminal window).\n\nTRY RUNNING the gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command AGAIN in this newly opened terminal window:\n\ngcloud components install cloud-run-proxy\nRun this command in the regular (non-administrator) MINGW64 terminal after verifying and correcting your PATH and restarting your computer.\n\nBy carefully verifying and correcting your PATH environment variable to include the Google Cloud SDK bin directory (and optionally the bundledpython directory), and then restarting your computer, you should resolve the \"python: not found\" error.\n\nPlease follow these steps meticulously, especially the PATH verification and the system restart. Then try running gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy again and let me know if it works this time!\n\nLet's get that PATH fixed and the gcloud command working! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
