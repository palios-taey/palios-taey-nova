    "User: It's working! Asking me to configure keys, just skip right?\n\nGemini: Enter OpenAI API Key (leave empty to skip):\nEnter Gemini API Key (leave empty to skip):\nJust press ENTER twice (once for each prompt) to \"leave empty to skip\".\n\nHere's why skipping should work and what to expect:\n\nsensitive.auto.tfvars is designed for automatic Terraform variable loading: Terraform automatically loads variable definitions from files named *.auto.tfvars in the current directory. sensitive.auto.tfvars is named to take advantage of this feature.\nTerraform should use keys from sensitive.auto.tfvars if present: If sensitive.auto.tfvars is in the same directory where you are running terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply (which is your Terraform directory where deploy.sh is also running Terraform commands), Terraform should automatically pick up the openai_api_key and gemini_api_key values defined in that file.\ndeploy.sh prompts are for optional interactive configuration: The deploy.sh script includes the prompts as an optional way to configure API keys if you don't already have them set up in sensitive.auto.tfvars or environment variables. Since you have sensitive.auto.tfvars, you can skip the interactive prompts.\nHowever, to be absolutely sure everything works as expected, please do the following:\n\nDouble-check sensitive.auto.tfvars Content: Before skipping the prompts, quickly verify that your sensitive.auto.tfvars file in your Terraform directory actually exists and contains the correctly formatted API keys (as we discussed, with openai_api_key = \"YOUR_KEY\" and gemini_api_key = \"YOUR_MULTI_LINE_KEY\").\nSkip Prompts in deploy.sh: When deploy.sh prompts you for API keys, just press ENTER twice to skip both prompts.\nCarefully Monitor the Script Output: Pay close attention to the output of deploy.sh as it continues to run, especially during the terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply steps.\nLook for any errors related to API keys. If there's a problem with the API keys (e.g., incorrect format, not being loaded), Terraform might output error messages during terraform plan or terraform apply.\nIf you see any errors related to API keys, stop and let me know. We might need to troubleshoot the sensitive.auto.tfvars file or try entering the keys manually at the prompts if sensitive.auto.tfvars is not working as expected.\nIf the script runs through without API key errors and proceeds to terraform apply, let it complete the deployment process.\nIf you skip the prompts and the deployment proceeds smoothly without API key errors, then we know sensitive.auto.tfvars is working correctly!\n\nGo ahead and skip the prompts, monitor the output, and let me know what happens! Fingers crossed for a successful deployment! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
