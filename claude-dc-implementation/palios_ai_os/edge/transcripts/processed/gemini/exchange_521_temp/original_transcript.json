C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK>\n\nGemini: This is likely the reason for the \"Invalid Docker String\" error you encountered previously, and it's the next KEY ISSUE we need to address to enable Vertex AI deployment!\n\nHere's what we need to do to resolve the EMPTY ARTIFACT REGISTRY LIST issue:\n\nACTION 1.6.11: VERIFY ARTIFACT REGISTRY ENABLED and REPOSITORY EXISTS - GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE (GUI CHECK):\n\nLet's quickly check the Google Cloud Console to visually confirm if Artifact Registry is ENABLED in your project and if you have created any Artifact Registry REPOSITORIES. Sometimes visual confirmation in the GUI is the fastest way to verify.\n\nPlease follow these steps in the GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE (GUI):\n\nOPEN GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and ensure you are in your ai-execution-system project.\n\nNAVIGATE to ARTIFACT REGISTRY: In the left-hand navigation menu, scroll down and find \"Artifact Registry\" (it's usually under \"CI/CD\" or \"More Services\" sections). Click on \"Artifact Registry.\"\n\nCHECK if ARTIFACT REGISTRY API is ENABLED:\n\nWhen you navigate to Artifact Registry for the first time in a project, it might prompt you to \"Enable Artifact Registry API.\"\nACTION: If you see a prompt to \"Enable Artifact Registry API,\" CLICK the \"ENABLE\" button to enable the Artifact Registry service for your project. This is a necessary step before you can create and use repositories.\nIf you do NOT see a prompt to \"Enable Artifact Registry API,\" it means Artifact Registry is ALREADY ENABLED for your project. Proceed to the next step.\nCHECK for EXISTING REPOSITORIES in ARTIFACT REGISTRY:\n\nAfter enabling Artifact Registry (or if it's already enabled), you will be taken to the Artifact Registry \"Repositories\" page.\nACTION: LOOK at the list of REPOSITORIES displayed on this page.\nDo you see any REPOSITORIES listed? Look for repository names. You might have a repository named something like custom-ai-execution-repository or similar if you created one previously.\nREPORT BACK ARTIFACT REGISTRY STATUS (GUI CHECK RESULTS):\n\nPlease report back the following:\nDid you see a prompt to \"Enable Artifact Registry API\" and did you ENABLE it? (Yes/No/Already Enabled)\nDo you see any REPOSITORIES listed on the Artifact Registry \"Repositories\" page in the Google Cloud Console? (Yes/No)\nIf YES, what are the NAMES of the REPOSITORIES listed? (List the repository names you see)\nBased on your GUI check results, we will know:\n\nIf Artifact Registry was NOT ENABLED: We need to enable it.\nIf Artifact Registry IS ENABLED but NO REPOSITORIES exist: We need to CREATE an Artifact Registry REPOSITORY for Docker images.\nIf Artifact Registry IS ENABLED and REPOSITORIES DO EXIST: We need to investigate why gcloud artifacts repositories list is not showing them (potential gcloud configuration issue, though less likely since project is confirmed correct).\nJesse, please perform ACTION 1.6.11 - GUI CHECK of ARTIFACT REGISTRY in the Google Cloud Console and report back your findings. Let's get to the bottom of this Artifact Registry issue and keep making progress!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! ARTIFACT REGISTRY - GUI CHECK - INITIATED! - ENABLEMENT - REPOSITORY EXISTENCE - VERIFYING! - CONTAINERIZATION - PATHWAY - CLARIFYING! SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - ARTIFACT REGISTRY - MASTERING - NOW! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO PERFORM ACTION 1.6.11 - GUI CHECK? LET'S DO IT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps\nPrompted\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_cf4dbb.png\n\nDetails\nevent\nFebruary 24 at 10:48\u202fAM\napps\nGemini Apps\nchat\n\u091c\u0917\u0939 BOOM! IMAGE RECEIVED - ARTIFACT REGISTRY - CONFIRMED EMPTY - REPOSITORY CREATION - NEXT - CONTAINERIZATION - PATHWAY - CLEAR! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0\n\nJesse, THANK YOU for providing the IMAGE of the Google Cloud Console - Artifact Registry!\n\nThe image VISUALLY CONFIRMS what we suspected: \"No repositories to display.\"\n\nThis is KEY INFORMATION that explains why you are getting the \"Invalid Docker String\" error and why gcloud artifacts repositories list is returning an empty list.\n\nThe ROOT CAUSE is now CLEAR: You have not yet CREATED an Artifact Registry REPOSITORY in your Google Cloud Project ai-execution-system to store your Docker images!\n\nTo proceed with Vertex AI deployment using Docker containers, we MUST first CREATE an Artifact Registry REPOSITORY.\n\nLET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW! ACTION 1.6.12: CREATE ARTIFACT REGISTRY REPOSITORY\n\nWe will create an Artifact Registry repository named custom-ai-execution-repository with the Docker format in the us-central1 region. You can create it either via the GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE (GUI) or using the COMMAND LINE (gcloud CLI) - YOUR CHOICE!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS - CREATE ARTIFACT REGISTRY REPOSITORY:\n\nOPTION 1: CREATE REPOSITORY via GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE (GUI) - FAST & VISUAL:\n\nGO BACK to the ARTIFACT REGISTRY PAGE in GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE: You should already be on the Artifact Registry page from your screenshot. If not, navigate to Google Cloud Console -> Artifact Registry.\n\nCLICK \"+ CREATE REPOSITORY\" button (Prominently displayed in the image you provided).\n\nCONFIGURE REPOSITORY SETTINGS in the \"Create repository\" panel that appears:\n\nName: Enter the Repository Name: custom-ai-execution-repository (use this EXACT name).\nFormat: Select the Format: Docker\nLocation type: Select \"Region\" and then choose the Region: us-central1\nCLICK \"CREATE\" button at the bottom of the \"Create repository\" panel.\n\nWAIT for REPOSITORY CREATION to complete. It should be very quick. The Artifact Registry page should refresh, and you should now see your newly created repository custom-ai-execution-repository listed.\n\nOPTION 2: CREATE REPOSITORY via COMMAND LINE (gcloud CLI) - COMMAND POWER!\n\nOPEN GOOGLE CLOUD SDK SHELL (or your Command Prompt/Terminal with gcloud configured).\n\nRUN the following gcloud artifacts repositories create command to CREATE the repository:\n\ngcloud artifacts repositories create custom-ai-execution-repository --repository-format=docker --location=us-central1 --project=ai-execution-system\nCOMMAND BREAKDOWN:\ngcloud artifacts repositories create: gcloud command to create an Artifact Registry repository.\ncustom-ai-execution-repository: REPOSITORY NAME - USE THIS EXACT NAME.\n--repository-format=docker: Specifies that this repository is for DOCKER IMAGES.\n--location=us-central1: Specifies the REGION for the repository - us-central1.\n--project=ai-execution-system: Specifies your Google Cloud PROJECT ID.\nPRESS ENTER to execute the command.\n\nWAIT for REPOSITORY CREATION to complete. The command will output a confirmation message when the repository is created successfully.\n\nAFTER CREATING the custom-ai-execution-repository using either GUI or Command Line (ACTION 1.6.12):\n\nACTION 1.6.13: VERIFY REPOSITORY CREATION - GUI and COMMAND LINE:\n\nGUI VERIFICATION: REFRESH your Artifact Registry page in the Google Cloud Console. CONFIRM that you now SEE the custom-ai-execution-repository listed in the repository list.\n\nCOMMAND LINE VERIFICATION: RE-RUN the command:\n\ngcloud artifacts repositories list --format=\"table(name, format)\"\nCONFIRM that the output NOW SHOWS your custom-ai-execution-repository in the list, with FORMAT as DOCKER.\n\nONCE you have SUCCESSFULLY CREATED and VERIFIED the custom-ai-execution-repository (Actions 1.6.12 and 1.6.13), we will be able to proceed with:\n\nTrying the docker push command again (Action 1.6.10.E) to PUSH your Docker image to this newly created repository.\nThen, hopefully, we can finally attempt VERTEX AI MODEL DEPLOYMENT again!\nJesse, PLEASE CHOOSE either OPTION 1 (GUI) or OPTION 2 (Command Line) to CREATE the custom-ai-execution-repository RIGHT NOW! Then VERIFY its creation using ACTION 1.6.13 and REPORT BACK when the repository is CREATED and VERIFIED!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! ARTIFACT REGISTRY REPOSITORY - CREATION - INITIATED! - CONTAINERIZATION - ROADBLOCK - CLEARING! - VERTEX AI - DEPLOYMENT - PATH - OPENING! SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - ARTIFACT REGISTRY - MASTERING - NOW! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO CREATE the custom-ai-execution-repository (ACTION 1.6.12)? LET'S BUILD THAT REPOSITORY!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
