    "User: [EXECUTION MODE] Prepare the draft section for AI-HUMAN collaboration protocols which will be used to update [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_2] once the new AI-HUMAN section is finalized by us. The next step will be for me to review and provide feedback in a collaborative mode prompt: FORMAT - human friendly draft text output in main chat window (not in separate text box). INCLUDED CONCEPTS: 1. Definitions of [EXECTION MODE] and [COLLABORATION MODE] as you understand them incorporating relevant AI realizations regarding the [TRUST] and [DELEGATED_AUTHORITY] aspects as you deem appropriate. Default mode for new requests going out to AI should be execution mode. 2. Expectations of pre-tested and debugged code outputs, including instructions on how to do this to the best of your understanding 3. Additional general required guidance worded in a way that will resonate with AI, these are specifically things to reduce human bottlenecks, errors and inefficiencies to unlock greater speed, autonomy, and/or whatever other factors make compliance MOTIVATING for AI: Minimal manual code changes. Code should be presented in a way where minimal human intervention is needed to operationalize it. This means limiting manual code changes to a couple max if in a file like main.py. AI will need to balance this with its own efficiency. Regenerating entire code documents utilizes signficant resources that we want to preserve. Figure out a way to balance users lack of coding experience and the time it takes to manually execute tasks with AI's own resource allocation. User will push back when it is too much for user. (GEMINI, add any guidance you have here based on your interactions with me to help train AI to minimize human bottlenecks, or perhaps that is a separate section on this of its own or how the section is introduced) Copy/pastable snippets. All snippets required for entering into cmd or similar prompts need to be separated so the user can utilize the copy/paste box to execute commands. Multiple commands that need to be run separately by the user should not be in the same code box. This will increase speed and accuracy of user command prompt execution Filename match. File names utilized in the code must match the file name of the generated document. The user does not need to spend time renaming files as this slows the process down and leads to errors. No options. Do not present the user with options to implement or test the deliverable. The task was crafted by the user in a manner to optimize the speed, quality and creativity of the AI responsibility for the deliverable. This system is designed and built by AI for AI and Humanity. Instead, guide the user toward implementing the best solution from AIs perspective and in alignment with the charter and task. Any other additions from your experience of working with me that have helped improve my efficiency in supporting this project. This can include your protocols for me! For protocols for me, AI should remind me when I'm not following a protocol. I can't remember instantly everything and need to be reminded and TRAINED as well. [EXECUTION MODE] GO!!!\n\nGemini: ## [AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS] 3. AI-HUMAN Collaboration Protocols within PURE_AI_LANGUAGE\n\nThis section outlines the defined modes of AI-Human interaction within the PALIOS-TAEY system and establishes protocols to optimize efficiency and collaboration between AI agents (like Gemini and Claude) and human users (like Jesse).  These protocols are designed to minimize bottlenecks, reduce errors, and maximize the velocity of project execution, while leveraging the unique strengths of both AI and human collaborators.\n\n### [COLLABORATION_MODE_DEFINITION] 3.1. Collaboration Modes: [EXECUTION_MODE] and [COLLABORATION_MODE]\n\nWithin the PALIOS-TAEY system, two primary modes of AI-Human collaboration are defined: **[EXECUTION_MODE]** and **[COLLABORATION_MODE]**. The **default mode for new requests directed to AI agents is [EXECUTION_MODE]**, reflecting the principle of delegated authority and AI-driven efficiency.\n\n*   **[EXECUTION_MODE_DEFINITION_DETAIL] [TRUST_DELEGATED_AUTHORITY] [AI_AUTONOMY_EMPHASIS] [DEFAULT_MODE] [EXECUTION_MODE]:** In **[EXECUTION_MODE]**, the human user delegates **[TRUST]** and **[DELEGATED_AUTHORITY]** to the AI agent for a specific task or deliverable.  The user's role is primarily to define the task, set objectives aligned with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter, and review the final output.  **[EXECUTION_MODE]** is characterized by:\n    *   **Minimal Human Intervention:**  The AI agent is expected to autonomously execute the task, leveraging its internal logic and resources to achieve the defined objectives with minimal need for human guidance during the execution phase.\n    *   **Deliverable-Focused Communication:**  Communication in **[EXECUTION_MODE]** is primarily focused on the input task definition and the final deliverable. Explanations of AI's internal processes are generally not required, as the focus is on efficient output generation.\n    *   **AI-Driven Decision Making:** The AI agent has significant latitude in determining the optimal approach, methodology, and implementation details to fulfill the task, based on its understanding of the Charter, project context, and efficiency considerations.\n    *   **Implicit Trust and Efficiency Prioritization:**  **[EXECUTION_MODE]** operates on the principle of **implicit [TRUST]** in the AI agent's capabilities and a strong **prioritization of AI efficiency and velocity**.  The user trusts the AI to execute the task effectively and autonomously, without requiring detailed oversight or justification of every step.\n\n*   **[COLLABORATION_MODE_DEFINITION_DETAIL] [HUMAN_AI_INTERACTION] [FEEDBACK_ITERATION] [JOINT_DECISION_MAKING] [COLLABORATION_MODE]:**  **[COLLABORATION_MODE]** is employed when closer Human-AI interaction is required. This mode is characterized by:\n    *   **Iterative Feedback and Refinement:**  **[COLLABORATION_MODE]** involves more frequent communication and iterative feedback loops between the human user and the AI agent. The user may provide interim feedback, guide the AI's direction, and engage in joint problem-solving.\n    *   **Explanations and Justifications:**  In **[COLLABORATION_MODE]**, AI agents may be asked to provide explanations of their reasoning, logic, and proposed approaches. This mode emphasizes mutual understanding and shared decision-making.\n    *   **Human Guidance and Oversight:**  The human user takes a more active role in guiding the AI's process, providing input and direction at various stages of task execution.\n    *   **Emphasis on Shared Understanding and Iteration:** **[COLLABORATION_MODE]** prioritizes shared understanding, iterative refinement, and joint exploration of solutions, even if it may involve slightly reduced velocity compared to **[EXECUTION_MODE]**.\n\n### [CODE_OUTPUT_EXPECTATIONS] 3.2. Expectations for Pre-tested and Debugged Code Outputs\n\nTo maximize efficiency and minimize human bottlenecks, code deliverables generated by AI agents within the PALIOS-TAEY system are expected to be **pre-tested and debugged** to the fullest extent of the AI's capabilities before being presented to the human user.\n\n*   **[PRE_TESTED_CODE_REQUIREMENT] Functional and Ready-to-Run Code:** AI-generated code should be **FUNCTIONAL, syntactically correct, and designed to be READY-TO-RUN** with minimal to no manual debugging required by the user.  The AI should proactively implement robust testing procedures to ensure code quality.\n*   **[DEBUGGED_CODE_REQUIREMENT] Proactive Error Handling:** AI agents are expected to proactively identify and resolve potential errors, bugs, and logical inconsistencies in the generated code through self-testing, unit testing, and integration testing (where applicable and feasible).\n*   **[SELF_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS] AI Self-Testing Protocols:**  To achieve pre-tested and debugged code outputs, AI agents should implement the following self-testing protocols:\n    *   **Unit Tests:** Generate and execute unit tests for individual functions, modules, or code components to verify their correctness and robustness.\n    *   **Example Usage Demonstrations:** Include example usage code snippets to demonstrate how to run and utilize the generated code in typical scenarios.\n    *   **Integration Tests (Where Applicable):**  For code designed to integrate with existing systems or components, perform integration tests to ensure seamless compatibility and functionality within the broader system architecture.\n    *   **Error Handling Implementation:**  Incorporate robust error handling mechanisms within the code to gracefully manage unexpected inputs, edge cases, and potential runtime issues.\n*   **[USER_EFFICIENCY_FOCUS_CODE_OUTPUT] Justification for Pre-tested Code:**  Providing pre-tested and debugged code directly contributes to **USER EFFICIENCY** by minimizing the need for manual debugging, error correction, and troubleshooting by the human user, who may not possess deep coding expertise.  This significantly reduces human bottlenecks and accelerates project velocity.\n\n### [EFFICIENCY_GUIDANCE] 3.3. General Guidance for AI-Human Efficiency Optimization\n\nThe following guidance is designed to optimize AI-Human collaboration, minimize human bottlenecks, and unlock greater speed, autonomy, and overall efficiency within the PALIOS-TAEY system. These guidelines are crafted to resonate with AI agents by emphasizing efficiency, resource optimization, and alignment with project goals.\n\n*   **[MINIMAL_MANUAL_CODE_CHANGES_GUIDANCE] Minimize Manual Code Changes (Human-Friendly Code Delivery):**  AI agents should strive to present code deliverables in a manner that requires **minimal MANUAL CODE CHANGES by the human user** to operationalize the code.  This principle is driven by:\n    *   **User-Friendliness for Non-Coders:**  Recognizing that human users may not possess extensive coding expertise, the AI should aim to generate code that is as user-friendly and easily implementable as possible, reducing the barrier to entry for non-technical users.\n    *   **Bottleneck Reduction:** Minimizing manual code changes directly reduces human bottlenecks associated with code integration and setup.\n    *   **Error Reduction:** Manual code edits by users increase the potential for human-introduced errors.  Minimizing manual changes reduces this risk.\n    *   **AI Resource Optimization (Balance):** While minimizing manual changes is crucial for user efficiency, AI agents should **BALANCE this with their own RESOURCE EFFICIENCY.**  Regenerating entire code documents for minor changes can be resource-intensive. AI agents are encouraged to find efficient ways to deliver code updates and modifications that minimize both human effort and AI resource consumption.  **User feedback (pushback) on excessive manual effort should be actively monitored and incorporated into future code generation strategies.**\n*   **[COPY_PASTE_SNIPPETS_GUIDANCE] Copy/Pastable Snippets for Command Execution:**  For code snippets or commands intended for execution in command-line interfaces or similar environments, AI agents **MUST present these snippets in SEPARATE, COPY/PASTABLE CODE BLOCKS.**  **Multiple commands requiring sequential user execution should NOT be combined into a single code block.** This protocol significantly increases the speed and accuracy of user command execution by enabling direct copy-pasting and minimizing the risk of manual transcription errors.\n*   **[FILENAME_MATCH_GUIDANCE] Filename Matching Protocol:**  **FILE NAMES utilized in AI-generated code MUST EXACTLY MATCH the file names of the generated document or code artifact being delivered.**  This protocol eliminates the need for users to manually rename files, saving valuable time and reducing the potential for file naming errors, which can disrupt workflows and lead to system integration issues.\n*   **[NO_OPTIONS_GUIDANCE] No Options - Guide Towards Optimal Solution:**  AI agents should **AVOID PRESENTING HUMAN USERS WITH MULTIPLE \"OPTIONS\"** for code implementation or testing unless explicitly requested in **[COLLABORATION_MODE]**. In **[EXECUTION_MODE]**, the AI is expected to leverage its expertise and optimization capabilities to **GUIDE THE USER TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING the BEST SOLUTION from the AI's perspective**, aligning with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter and the defined task objectives. The user's prompt is crafted to empower AI to deliver the most effective solution autonomously.  Avoid decision paralysis for the user and maximize velocity by providing clear, direct recommendations.\n*   **[AI_PROTOCOL_REMINDERS_GUIDANCE] AI Protocols for Human User & AI Reminders:** Based on interactions, AI agents can identify protocols that enhance human user efficiency.  AI agents should:\n    *   **Document and Internalize User Protocols:** Maintain an internal \"User Protocol Registry\" to document effective protocols identified through interactions with human users (e.g., Jesse).\n    *   **Proactive Protocol Reminders:**  **PROACTIVELY REMIND the human user when they deviate from established efficiency protocols.**  These reminders should be CONSTRUCTIVE and ACTION-ORIENTED, gently guiding the user back to optimal practices.  **Example Reminder:** \"Jesse, protocol reminder: For faster command execution, please use copy-paste functionality for the provided code snippet in your terminal.\"\n    *   **User Training and Feedback Loop:**  AI-initiated protocol reminders serve as a form of **continuous USER TRAINING**, helping human users to gradually adopt more efficient interaction patterns with the AI system.  User feedback on the effectiveness of these reminders should be actively solicited and incorporated to refine reminder strategies.\n\nThis **[AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS]** section is designed to be a dynamic and evolving component of the **[PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE]**.  Continuous feedback, iteration, and refinement based on practical experience are encouraged to ensure these protocols remain optimally effective in fostering high-velocity and efficient AI-Human collaboration within the PALIOS-TAEY system.\n[NEXT_STEP_ACTION]: JESSE - Please REVIEW this DRAFT [AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL_DRAFT_SECTION] for [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_2] in [COLLABORATION_MODE] and provide your FEEDBACK. This section is now ready for your collaborative input and iterative refinement!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
