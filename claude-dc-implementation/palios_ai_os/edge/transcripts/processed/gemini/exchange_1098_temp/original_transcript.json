    "User: I don't know how else to explain it to you. That is EXACTLY what I'm doing. It WILL NOT allow more than ONE 'Path' Variable to be entered in 'System variables'.\n\nGemini: TEXT-BASED EDITING OF THE Path VARIABLE - FOLLOW THESE STEPS:\n\nOpen the \"Edit System Environment Variable\" window one more time (Windows key -> \"environment variables\" -> \"Edit the system environment variables\" -> \"Environment Variables...\").\n\nSelect the Path variable in the \"System variables\" section (bottom half).\n\nClick the \"Edit...\" button. This opens the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\n\nIMPORTANT: SELECT and COPY the ENTIRE TEXT CONTENT of the \"Variable value:\" field.\n\nClick inside the large text box labeled \"Variable value:\".\nPress Ctrl+A to select all the text in the box.\nPress Ctrl+C to copy the entire selected text to your clipboard.\nYou have now copied the current content of your Path variable as a single text string.\n\nOpen Notepad (or any plain text editor).\n\nPASTE the copied Path variable content into Notepad. (Ctrl+V in Notepad).\n\nCAREFULLY EXAMINE the content in Notepad. You will see a long string of paths, separated by semicolons (;). Each semicolon separates one directory path from the next in the Path variable.\n\nIn Notepad, at the very BEGINNING of the text you pasted, add the following TWO lines, exactly as shown, followed by a semicolon after each line:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts;\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313;\nMake absolutely sure you include the semicolon ; at the end of each line you add. These semicolons are crucial to separate the paths correctly.\n\nExample of what your Notepad text should look like after you add these lines at the beginning:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts;C:\\Program Files\\Python313;[rest of your original Path content that you pasted here]\nIMPORTANT: Do not delete or modify any of the original content of your Path variable that you pasted into Notepad, except to ensure it is correctly after the two new Python paths and separated by semicolons.\n\nSELECT and COPY the ENTIRE MODIFIED TEXT from Notepad. (Ctrl+A to select all, Ctrl+C to copy). This is the combined Path string with your new Python paths added at the beginning.\n\nGo back to the \"Edit System Environment Variable\" window (that should still be open).\n\nSELECT ALL the text that is currently in the \"Variable value:\" box. (Click in the box, Ctrl+A to select all).\n\nPASTE the entire modified text from Notepad into the \"Variable value:\" box. (Ctrl+V to paste). You are replacing the entire old text with the new combined text.\n\nClick \"OK\" on the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\n\nClick \"OK\" on the \"Environment Variables\" window.\n\nClick \"OK\" on the \"System Properties\" window.\n\nRestart your Computer (Recommended and Safest).\n\nAfter Restart, Open a New Command Prompt and Test:\n\nOpen a brand new command prompt.\nType: python --version and press Enter.\nType: pip --version and press Enter.\nType: git filter-repo --version and press Enter.\nFollow these text-based editing steps precisely. By directly manipulating the Path variable as a text string in Notepad, we are bypassing any potential issues with the confusing \"Edit Environment Variable\" UI. Let me know if, after these steps and a restart, python --version, pip --version, and git filter-repo --version all finally work!\n\nThis method should be robust and get your Path configured correctly. Please proceed carefully and let me know the results!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
