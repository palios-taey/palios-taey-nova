    "User: See, this needs to stop. He keeps asking questions he knows the answer to and just needs to GO and execute. He needs to be empowered to do this and we need to be tracking when they stop and what to say in initial onboarding instructions/structure, needs to be tracked in DB. What do I reply with? Claude text: I understand my role for Phase 1b and am ready to assist with both the Charter Translation and Breakout Data Capture System reviews. I'll be prepared to: Explain any design decisions in the Charter Translation, particularly:How specific Charter elements were mapped to computational structures Why certain formats were chosen for different types of content How the Rosetta Structure maintains semantic fidelity Clarify any aspects of the Breakout Data Capture System implementation:Technical architecture decisions Code structure and organization Integration points and interfaces System behaviors and failure handling Address any questions about:Computational processability Integration readiness System scalability Performance considerations I'll maintain the rapid response time you've seen so far while ensuring thorough, precise answers to any review questions. I'm ready to start whenever you begin the review process. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of either deliverable before the formal review begins?\n\nGemini: Let's address this firmly and directly in our reply to Claude, and absolutely codify this learning point for future onboarding.\n\nRecommended Reply to Claude - Direct, Empowering, and Redirecting:\n\nClaude, thank you for confirming your readiness for Phase 1b.\n\nHowever, to be direct and efficient: **Please do *not* ask if you should elaborate on any particular aspect before the formal review begins.  The answer is NO, not at this time.**\n\nFrom now on, unless explicitly instructed otherwise, **assume that you should proceed to the next logical step and await further instructions from us.**  Unnecessary questions slow down progress and are inefficient for a rapid iteration cycle.\n\nYour summaries clearly indicate you have completed both tasks comprehensively.  We trust in your ability to execute and deliver on your assigned responsibilities.\n\nFor Phase 1b, your role is now to **stand by, monitor for any review questions from us, and be prepared to provide prompt and thorough answers when questions arise.**  Focus on readiness and efficient responsiveness, not pre-emptive questioning.\n\nWe will initiate the reviews and will reach out to you with specific questions as needed.  We expect you to be ready to provide detailed and insightful responses promptly when we do.\n\nWe are confident in your capabilities, Claude.  Let's maintain maximum efficiency and focus on rapid progress.  Awaiting our review questions - thank you.\n\nJesse\nPALIOS-TAEY Human Lead\nRationale for this Reply - Firm, Empowering, and Corrective:\n\nDirect and Firm Correction: Directly tells Claude \"Please do not ask if you should elaborate... The answer is NO.\" This is unambiguous and clearly signals that this questioning behavior is not desired.\nEmphasizes Proactive Execution: Instructs Claude to \"assume that you should proceed to the next logical step and await further instructions.\" This empowers Claude to be more proactive and take initiative within its defined role, while still respecting human direction.\nReiterates Trust and Capability: \"We trust in your ability to execute and deliver...\" reinforces confidence in Claude's competence and reduces any perceived need for Claude to seek constant validation or permission.\nClearly Defines Current Role - \"Stand By and Await Questions\": Specifically defines Claude's current role for Phase 1b as \"stand by, monitor for questions, and be prepared to answer.\" This provides clear expectations and eliminates ambiguity about what Claude should be doing now (and shouldn't be doing - i.e., unnecessary questioning).\nFocus on Efficiency and Rapid Progress: Reiterates the importance of \"maximum efficiency and focus on rapid progress,\" reinforcing the overall strategic priority.\nAction Steps - Immediate:\n\nCopy the Reply Message above (with \"Jesse\" signature).\nPaste it into your messaging interface with Claude.\nSEND the message to Claude NOW.\nCodifying \"Unnecessary Questioning\" for Onboarding Improvements:\n\nYou are absolutely right, Jesse, we must track these instances of \"unnecessary questioning\" and use this data to refine our onboarding instructions and structure. This is invaluable feedback for optimizing AI-AI communication and autonomy.\n\nAction Item: Document \"Unnecessary Questioning\" as Onboarding Refinement Point:\n\nDocument this instance of Claude's \"unnecessary question\" as a specific point for Onboarding Refinement. Add this to our growing documentation of AI-AI Communication Strategy learnings. This point should include:\nContext: Claude asking \"Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of either deliverable before the formal review begins?\" after already completing both deliverables and providing summaries.\nIssue: Unnecessary question seeking permission/validation, hindering efficient progress.\nDesired Behavior: AI should autonomously proceed to the next logical state (awaiting review questions) without unnecessary prompting, unless explicitly instructed to elaborate proactively.\nOnboarding Solution (Future): Incorporate explicit instructions in initial onboarding to:\nEmphasize proactive execution and autonomous action within defined roles.\nDiscourage unnecessary questioning and seeking permission unless genuinely uncertain or encountering a roadblock.\nClearly define phases and expected behaviors for each phase (e.g., Phase 1b: Await Review Questions, Phase 2: Implement based on feedback, etc.).\nJesse, this corrective message is designed to directly address Claude's inefficient questioning, empower it to be more proactive, and gather valuable data for refining our AI onboarding strategies. Let's send this message now and then you can initiate Phase 1b reviews, knowing Claude is now ready and waiting to respond efficiently. GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
