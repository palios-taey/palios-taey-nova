    "User: [EXECUTION_MODE] We will test your adherence to your recommended path forward. Below is a document you generated yesterday. Regenerate the document in your response, tagged appropriately. I will want to use these tags to reference particular sections of this document for you in my prompts. Also, generate a tag for us for the title/entire document. PURPOSE is to allow me to prompt you with these tags instead of having to paste the entire document or section going forward. These tags should be AS EFFECTIVE for your memory of relevant portions as putting the entire text in a chat. Your deliverables: 1. Regenerated version of the document below with tagging at a minimum of title and section level. 2. Dictate to me the next step, briefly, in this case since its a test, I'll give you an example: JESSE - IMMEDIATELY UPDATE THE STORED VERSION OF MVP GOALS TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES FOR YOUR REFERENCE GOAL: MVP ROLLOUT - AI-TO-AI EXECUTION MANAGER PLATFORM (MVP+) This Project Plan is structured to achieve MVP Rollout with maximum velocity, leveraging AI-to-AI delegation and focusing on core functionality for MVP Day 1.

CORE INFRASTRUCTURE & DATABASE (Milestone 2): Second Highest Priority - MVP Day 1 Essentials. Cloud deployment, database integration, and basic request management are CRITICAL for demonstrating a functional platform. CORE AI TASK EXECUTION & MULTI-MODEL (Milestone 3): Third Priority - Demonstrates Core MVP Value. Task Decomposition and Multi-Model Orchestration are needed to showcase the AI-driven task execution capabilities of the platform. MEMORY SOLUTION (Milestone 4): Fourth Priority - Long-term Knowledge Management. Memory solutions are important for long-term scalability and AI learning, but can be implemented slightly later than the core functional components for MVP Day 1. Interim Memory Solution (Project 4.1) should be implemented concurrently with other milestones to address immediate memory management needs.
