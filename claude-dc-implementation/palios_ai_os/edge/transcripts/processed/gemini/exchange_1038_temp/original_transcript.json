Maybe you meant:   gcloud ai custom-jobs   gcloud ai endpoints   gcloud ai hp-tuning-jobs   gcloud ai index-endpoints   gcloud ai indexes   gcloud ai model-monitoring-jobs   gcloud ai models   gcloud ai operations   gcloud ai persistent-resources   gcloud ai tensorboards To search the help text of gcloud commands, run:   gcloud help -- SEARCH_TERMS\n\nGemini: SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: UPDATE your Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI):\n\nOpen your MINGW64 terminal.\n\nRun the command to update your Cloud SDK components:\n\ngcloud components update\nThis command will check for updates to your installed Cloud SDK components, including the gcloud run component.\n\nFollow the prompts in the terminal. gcloud components update will likely show you a list of components that can be updated. Type Y (for Yes) and press ENTER to proceed with updating all components.\n\nWait for the update process to complete. This might take a few minutes as it downloads and installs the latest components. You will see progress messages in the terminal.\n\nOnce the update is complete, you should see a message like \"All components are up to date.\" or \"Your Cloud SDK is up to date.\"\n\nAfter the update is finished, TRY RUNNING the RENAME COMMAND AGAIN:\n\ngcloud run services rename ai-execution-system-core --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --destination-service ai-execution-system\nRun this rename command in your MINGW64 terminal again after updating the Cloud SDK.\n\nBy updating your Google Cloud SDK, you should get the latest version of the gcloud command-line tool, which should include the gcloud run services rename subcommand.\n\nAfter you have updated your Cloud SDK and tried running the rename command AGAIN, please let me know if it works this time!\n\nRegarding your other questions while the update is running:\n\n\"I'm good with whatever you think for next steps based on the plan.\" - Excellent! We are on the same page. Focusing on Project 2.3 (/task endpoint) after renaming the service is the plan.\n\n\"Let's just do it as efficiently as possible and if a lot of coding involved, let's get it over to Claude.\" - 100% agreed! Efficiency and delegation are key!\n\n\"Is there no need to connect GitHub to Cloud Run? ... Or is it too soon.\" - We will address GitHub integration as a slightly later step (Milestone 2 or 3). For now, let's focus on getting the core API functionality working and deployed.\n\n\"Do we need to test anything? Let's get the name right first and can discuss.\" - Yes, testing is crucial, and getting the naming consistent is a great priority!\n\nSo, for now, please focus on UPDATING your Google Cloud SDK using gcloud components update command. Once that is complete, try running the rename command again, and let me know if it works this time. We'll get the naming consistent first, and then proceed with implementing the /task endpoint and testing it!\n\nLet's update gcloud and try the rename again! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
