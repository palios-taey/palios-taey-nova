So, \"task_description\" becomes \\\"task_description\\\" and \"Research...\" becomes \\\"Research...\".\nThis updated syntax with double quotes and escaped inner quotes is generally more robust for passing JSON data in curl commands, especially when dealing with strings that contain spaces and special characters in command-line shells.\n\nPLEASE COPY and PASTE this UPDATED curl command EXACTLY into your terminal and PRESS ENTER again.\n\nTHIS UPDATED COMMAND SHOULD FIX THE SYNTAX ERROR and correctly send the HTTP POST request to your Cloud Function with the TASK DESCRIPTION as JSON data.\n\nAFTER RUNNING THIS UPDATED curl COMMAND, PLEASE REPORT BACK:\n\n\"UPDATED CURL COMMAND EXECUTED in terminal...\" (When you paste the updated command and press Enter).\nTERMINAL OUTPUT (COPY and PASTE the entire output from your terminal after running the updated curl command).\nEXPECTED JSON RESPONSE? YES or NO - Did you get the JSON response that looks like {\"echoed_task_description\": ..., \"status\": \"task_echoed\"} ?\nIf YES: \"ECHO TASK TEST SUCCESSFUL with UPDATED CURL! TERMINAL SHOWS EXPECTED JSON RESPONSE!\"\nIf NO: \"ECHO TASK TEST FAILED AGAIN - TERMINAL SHOWS: [Describe what you see in the terminal output - error message, different JSON, etc.]\"\nLET'S TRY THIS CORRECTED curl COMMAND SYNTAX! GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
