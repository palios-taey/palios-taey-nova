    "User: I have Git desktop installed, C:\\Program Files\\Git\n\nGemini: We need to VERIFY if the git command-line tool is accessible in cmd.exe even though you have Git Desktop installed.\n\nPlease run these commands again in your command prompt and tell me the EXACT output of each:\n\ngit --version\n(Press Enter)\n\nwhere git\n(Press Enter)\n\nIt's absolutely crucial that you run these commands in cmd.exe and give me the exact output.\n\nIf git --version and where git still give you the \"'git' is not recognized...\" errors, even with Git Desktop installed, it means the command-line git tool is not correctly configured for your command prompt. In this case, we will likely still need to proceed with installing \"Git for Windows\" from git-scm.com as I described earlier, to ensure the command-line tools are properly set up.\n\nIf git --version and where git now work and show Git version and path information, then it's possible that Git Desktop installation did somehow configure the command-line Git, or perhaps you had Git installed previously and forgot. If they work, that's great news, and we might be able to proceed directly to running git filter-repo.\n\nPlease run git --version and where git in cmd.exe right now and tell me the output. This will determine our next step!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
