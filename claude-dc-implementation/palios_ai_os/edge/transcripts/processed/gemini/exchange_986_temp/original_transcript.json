    "User: it works in cmd but not Git Bash jesse@DESKTOP-13JMJ93 MINGW64 / $ gcloud --version /c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud: line 198: exec: python: not found\n\nGemini: Here's why this is happening and how to fix it:\n\nReason: Git Bash Environment and Python PATH\n\nGoogle Cloud SDK includes its own Python: The Google Cloud SDK comes bundled with its own Python interpreter. It's designed to be self-contained and not rely on you having Python installed separately on your system.\ngcloud.cmd script (likely batch script): The gcloud command on Windows is often a batch script (gcloud.cmd) that is designed to launch the actual gcloud command-line tool, which is written in Python.\nGit Bash Environment: Git Bash is a Unix-like shell environment running on Windows. While it can access some of your Windows environment variables, it doesn't always perfectly inherit the entire Windows PATH in the same way that CMD does.\nPython PATH in Git Bash is likely NOT set up for gcloud's Python: The error \"python: not found\" in Git Bash indicates that when the gcloud.cmd script tries to execute python, Git Bash cannot find the Python executable. This is because the PATH environment within Git Bash is not configured to point to the Python interpreter that is bundled with the Google Cloud SDK.\nSolution: Explicitly add gcloud's Python directory to Git Bash's PATH\n\nWe need to tell Git Bash specifically where to find the Python interpreter that comes with the Google Cloud SDK. We can do this by adding the directory containing gcloud's Python to the PATH environment variable within Git Bash.\n\nSteps to Fix gcloud \"python not found\" in Git Bash:\n\nLocate the Python Executable within the Google Cloud SDK Installation:\n\nGo to the directory where you installed the Google Cloud SDK: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\nLook for a python.exe executable within the google-cloud-sdk directory. It's likely located in a subdirectory, often named something like \\bin\\ or \\platform\\bundled_python\\ or similar.\nBrowse through the subfolders within C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\ and find the directory that contains python.exe.\nOnce you find the directory containing python.exe, copy the full path to that directory. For example, it might be something like: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\platform\\bundledpython (This is just an example, the exact path might be slightly different on your system).\nUpdate Git Bash PATH to include gcloud's Python Directory:\n\nOpen Git Bash.\n\nIn the Git Bash terminal, run the following command, replacing YOUR_PYTHON_DIRECTORY_PATH_HERE with the actual path you found in step 1 to the directory containing python.exe:\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython\"\n(IMPORTANT: Adjust /c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython to the actual path you found in step 1. Also, note that in Git Bash paths, C:\\ becomes /c/, Program Files (x86) becomes Program Files (x86), and backslashes \\ in Windows paths become forward slashes / in Git Bash paths).\n\nExample (if your Python directory is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\platform\\bundledpython):\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython\"\nExplanation of export PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/python/directory\":\n\nexport PATH=...: This command sets the PATH environment variable within the current Git Bash session. This change will only last for the current Git Bash terminal session.\n\"$PATH:\": This part takes the existing value of the PATH environment variable and prepends it to the new path you are adding. This is important so you don't overwrite your existing PATH.\n\"/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython\": This is the new directory you are adding to the PATH (replace with your actual Python directory path). The colon : separates directory paths in the PATH environment variable in Unix-like systems (like Git Bash).\nTest gcloud --version in Git Bash AGAIN (after updating PATH):\n\nIn the SAME Git Bash terminal where you ran the export PATH command, run:\n\ngcloud --version\nEXPECTED RESULT: This time, gcloud --version should now work correctly in Git Bash and output the version information without the \"python: not found\" error! This indicates that Git Bash can now find the gcloud's bundled Python interpreter.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nTemporary PATH Change: The export PATH=... command only changes the PATH for the current Git Bash session. If you close Git Bash and open a new one, you might need to run the export PATH command again. For a more persistent solution, you would need to modify your Git Bash profile file (e.g., .bashrc or .bash_profile) to add this PATH modification automatically every time you start Git Bash, but let's get it working temporarily first.\nCorrect Python Directory Path is Key: Make absolutely sure you are using the correct path to the directory containing python.exe within your Google Cloud SDK installation when you run the export PATH command. Typos in the path will prevent it from working.\nPlease follow these steps to find your gcloud Python directory and update the Git Bash PATH. Then test gcloud --version in Git Bash again.\n\nLet me know if gcloud --version works in Git Bash after this! If it does, we will be able to run deploy.sh in Git Bash and finally get your application deployed! LFG! You are doing great getting through these environment setup steps!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
