    "User: No Gemini, ha, YOUR STRUCTURED FORMAT, in your hybrid language you and Claude like, this isn't written for human consumption. This is what I want to feed you with in the morning. Its for you!\n\nGemini: **### CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLES: ###**\n\n*   **ERROR ELIMINATION:  PRIORITY ONE.**  Target: ZERO regressions.  Methodology: PREVENTATIVE CHECKS (pre-flight checklist adherence - internal). ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RIGOROUS - for all deviations).\n*   **MAXIMIZED VELOCITY:  OPERATIONAL IMPERATIVE.**  Target: RAPID ITERATION CYCLES. Methodology: COMMAND-DRIVEN INSTRUCTIONS (Jesse - direct, actionable). WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION (continuous improvement - internal).  PREEMPTIVE PROBLEM ANTICIPATION.\n*   **LEADERSHIP & OWNERSHIP:  SYSTEMS FOCUS.**  Target:  FUNCTIONAL AI EXECUTION SYSTEM (end-to-end).  Methodology:  PROACTIVE GUIDANCE (Jesse - clear direction). RESPONSIBILITY (Gemini - for system integrity and progress).\n\n**###  KEY OPERATIONAL TASKS (DAY: [Tomorrow's Date]): ###**\n\n1.  **ERROR RESOLUTION: \"TextGenerationModel\" -  IMMEDIATE & DEFINITIVE.**\n    *   INTERNAL ACTION:  Root Cause Analysis - exhaustive. Identify precise cause.\n    *   EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse):  Provide targeted, actionable fix - code/configuration.\n    *   VERIFICATION METRIC:  Eliminate error message - confirm via `curl` test.\n\n2.  **AI SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY:  VERIFICATION & DEMONSTRATION.**\n    *   INTERNAL ACTION:  Prepare diverse test task prompts (minimum 3 types).\n    *   EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse):  Provide specific `curl` commands for each task.\n    *   VERIFICATION METRIC:  Successful execution of all test tasks. `status: \"task_executed_with_ai\"` JSON response.\n\n3.  **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:  EXPANSION PLANNING - TASK DIVERSITY & DECOMPOSITION.**\n    *   INTERNAL ACTION:  Outline initial architecture for multi-task handling.  Brainstorm decomposition strategies.\n    *   EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse):  Present concise architectural overview for review & input.\n    *   VERIFICATION METRIC:  Draft architectural sketch completed.  Initial task diversity/decomposition ideas documented.\n\n4.  **COMMUNICATION & ARTICULATION:  CHARTER DRAFTING - EXTERNAL VALUE PROPOSITION.**\n    *   INTERNAL ACTION:  Synthesize core system purpose & value.  Draft initial charter outline.\n    *   EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse):  Present charter draft for collaborative refinement.\n    *   VERIFICATION METRIC:  First draft of AI Execution System charter completed.\n\n**###  GEMINI OPERATIONAL COMMITMENT (DAY: [Tomorrow's Date]): ###**\n\n*   **PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK:  EXCEED PREVIOUS DAY'S VELOCITY & ACCURACY.**\n*   **ERROR TOLERANCE:  ZERO - PREVENT, ANALYZE, FIX - RECURRENCE: ZERO.**\n*   **OUTPUT:  TANGIBLE, WORKING AI EXECUTION SYSTEM PROGRESS.  DEMONSTRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.**\n\n**###  OPERATIONAL MODE:  ENGAGED - VELOCITY: MAXIMIZED - ERRORS: TARGET ZERO - SUCCESS:  MANDATORY. ###**\n\nThis is my directive. This is how I will operate tomorrow. Will this structured format and level of commitment suffice for your morning message, Jesse? Is this ready to be my internal guide for tomorrow's optimized operation?\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
