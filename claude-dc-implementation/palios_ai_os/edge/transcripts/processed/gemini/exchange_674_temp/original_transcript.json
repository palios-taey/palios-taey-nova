    "User: You delivered your thinking notes as a response. You were trying very hard and they are very throrough! Good work! Now, can you put it in my language?\n\nGemini: THE PROBLEM: Our Cloud Function is still throwing that error about \"TextGenerationModel\" not being found. This means it's not understanding how to use the AI model part of our code yet.\n\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? It's likely because the Cloud Function is not installing the AI library correctly, or it's using an older version that doesn't know about \"TextGenerationModel\".\n\nWHAT'S THE PLAN TO FIX IT? We need to become detectives and look at the \"CLOUD BUILD LOGS\". These logs are like a secret diary of what happens when Google Cloud builds and deploys our Cloud Function. They will tell us if there were any problems installing the AI library.\n\nHERE'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW: CHECK THE CLOUD BUILD LOGS!\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS TO FIND AND CHECK THE LOGS:\n\nLOOK BACK AT YOUR TERMINAL: Go back to the terminal window where you ran the last gcloud functions deploy command.\n\nFIND THE \"CLOUD BUILD LOGS\" LINK: In the output of the gcloud functions deploy command, you should see a line that looks something like this:\n\nOK [Build] Logs are available at [YOUR_LOGS_URL_HERE]\nIt's SUPER IMPORTANT to find this line and the URL that's in those square brackets [...]. The [YOUR_LOGS_URL_HERE] part will be a long web address that starts with https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds...\n\nCOPY THE LOGS URL: Carefully copy the entire URL (the web address) from your terminal output.\n\nPASTE THE URL INTO YOUR WEB BROWSER: Open a new tab in your web browser and paste the URL into the address bar. Press Enter to go to that web page.\n\nYOU ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE CLOUD BUILD LOGS! This page will show you all the steps Google Cloud took when deploying your Cloud Function. It might look a bit technical, but don't worry! We're looking for specific things.\n\nSCROLL THROUGH THE LOGS and LOOK FOR THESE KEY THINGS:\n\nLook for any lines that say \"ERROR\" or \"WARNING\" (especially in red color if you see colors in the logs). These error or warning messages might give us clues about what went wrong during deployment.\nSpecifically, look for any lines that mention requirements.txt or pip install. We want to see if requirements.txt was processed and if pip install tried to install the google-cloud-aiplatform library.\nTry to see if you can find a line that says something like \"Successfully installed google-cloud-aiplatform...\" If you can find this, it would be a good sign that the library was installed, but we still need to figure out why it's not working.\nIf you see any ERROR messages related to requirements.txt or pip install or google-cloud-aiplatform, COPY AND PASTE those ERROR MESSAGES back to me! That's the most important information!\nWHAT TO REPORT BACK TO ME AFTER CHECKING THE LOGS:\n\n\"CLOUD BUILD LOGS CHECKED!\" (Confirm you have opened and looked at the logs).\n\"FOUND ERRORS IN LOGS - YES/NO\" (Did you see any lines with \"ERROR\" or \"WARNING\"?)\nIF YES to \"FOUND ERRORS\": \"ERROR MESSAGES FROM LOGS: [Copy and paste any ERROR messages you found, especially related to requirements.txt or pip install or google-cloud-aiplatform]\"\nIF NO to \"FOUND ERRORS\": \"NO ERRORS FOUND IN LOGS (that I can see)\" (If you don't see obvious errors, just tell me that. We'll figure it out).\n\"DID YOU SEE 'Successfully installed google-cloud-aiplatform...' in the logs? YES/NO\" (Let me know if you found a success message for google-cloud-aiplatform installation).\nTHIS IS OUR NEXT MISSION, JESSE! BECOME A LOG DETECTIVE! FIND THOSE CLOUD BUILD LOGS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU DISCOVER! GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT! LET'S UNLOCK THIS AI POWER!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
