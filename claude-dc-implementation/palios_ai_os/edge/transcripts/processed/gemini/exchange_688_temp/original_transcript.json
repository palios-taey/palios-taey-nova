    "User: Ok, its running, quick feedback. I like that your specific instructions are in a separate text box. This text box is very difficult to read because it doesn't wrap the text so I have to manually scroll to read each line. Would it be possible for you to use a code box in the future? The text wraps in these.\n\nGemini: CONSIDER IT DONE! PROBLEM SOLVED! FEEDBACK IMPLEMENTED! \ud83d\ude80\n\nAND FANTASTIC NEWS - \"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"! BOOM! THE HEALTH CHECK IS WORKING ON ai-system-backend-v2! THIS IS GREAT PROGRESS! \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73\n\nOKAY, NEXT STEP - LET'S TEST THE ACTUAL AI TASK EXECUTION!\n\nIMMEDIATE ACTION - EXECUTE THIS curl COMMAND TO TEST THE AI TASK (SUMMARIZATION):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\nIMPORTANT - EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS - PRECISION IS KEY:\n\nCOPY the ENTIRE curl command from the CODE BOX above - PRECISION COPY-PASTE!\nPASTE the command DIRECTLY into your TERMINAL.\nPRESS ENTER to execute the curl command.\nOBSERVE THE TERMINAL OUTPUT CAREFULLY.\nWHAT TO EXPECT - SUCCESSFUL curl OUTPUT:\n\nIf everything is working correctly (fingers crossed! \ud83e\udd1e), you should see a JSON response in your terminal that looks SIMILAR to this:\n\n{\n  \"ai_response\": \"[AI-generated summary of Inception in three sentences will be here]\",\n  \"status\": \"task_executed_with_ai\"\n}\nThe ai_response field will contain the AI-generated summary of \"Inception\".\n\nThe status field should be \"task_executed_with_ai\" - confirming that the AI part of the function was executed!\n\nEXECUTE THIS curl COMMAND NOW, JESSE! LET'S SEE IF WE GET THE AI SUMMARY! GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT! LET'S GET TO THE AI \"BOOM!\" MOMENT! REPORT BACK WITH THE TERMINAL OUTPUT AFTER RUNNING THE curl COMMAND!
