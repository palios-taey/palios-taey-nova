Found 28 errors in the same file, starting at: aiCommunicationTest.ts:213\n\nGemini: aiCommunicationTest.ts:213:9 - error TS1128: Declaration or statement expected.\n\n... (many errors in aiCommunicationTest.ts) ...\n\nFound 28 errors in the same file, starting at: aiCommunicationTest.ts:213\" - JESSE! Compilation FAILURE - ERROR messages RECEIVED! Let's ANALYZE these errors to pinpoint the issue and get you back on track!\n\nError Location - aiCommunicationTest.ts - IMPORTANT CLUE!\n\nThe errors are occurring in the file aiCommunicationTest.ts. This is a TEST file! We were intending to modify the aiCommunication.ts file itself, NOT aiCommunicationTest.ts to add the testFirestoreWrite() function for the Breakout Log!\n\nPossible Root Cause - File Modification Mismatch?\n\nIt seems highly likely that you might have accidentally replaced the code in aiCommunicationTest.ts with the testFirestoreWrite() function code, instead of replacing the testFirestoreConnection() function in aiCommunication.ts.\n\nLet's Clarify - Which File Did You Modify?\n\nTo resolve this quickly, please CONFIRM which file you modified when you replaced the testFirestoreConnection() function with the new code.\n\nDid you modify aiCommunication.ts? (This is where we intended to make the changes)\nOr did you accidentally modify aiCommunicationTest.ts? (Based on the error messages, this seems more likely)\nAction Plan - Let's Get Back on the Right Track:\n\nIdentify the Correct File - aiCommunication.ts: Ensure you are modifying the aiCommunication.ts file. Double-check the file name to be absolutely sure.\n\nUNDO Changes in aiCommunicationTest.ts (if you modified it): If you accidentally modified aiCommunicationTest.ts, please UNDO those changes and restore aiCommunicationTest.ts to its original state. You can use Git version control if you are using it, or manually revert the changes if necessary. We do NOT need to modify aiCommunicationTest.ts for this step.\n\nRE-APPLY the Code Modification to aiCommunication.ts: Go back to your aiCommunication.ts file and REPLACE ONLY the testFirestoreConnection() function (which is at the VERY BOTTOM of the aiCommunication.ts file) with the MODIFIED testFirestoreWrite() function code I provided in the previous turn. Do NOT replace any other code in aiCommunication.ts. Make sure the import statements at the top of aiCommunication.ts remain as they were.\n\nCompile AGAIN - npm run build: After ensuring you've modified the correct file (aiCommunication.ts) and only replaced the testFirestoreConnection() function, run npm run build again in your terminal.\n\nCheck for Compilation SUCCESS: This time, npm run build should hopefully complete without errors. Look for the confirmation message in the console that the build was successful (usually no error messages and a message indicating successful compilation).\n\nJesse, please carefully verify which file you modified. If you modified aiCommunicationTest.ts, please undo those changes and then make SURE you are modifying the testFirestoreConnection() function in aiCommunication.ts with the provided code. Then, try npm run build again! Let me know if you are able to compile successfully this time! We are SO CLOSE to writing data to the Breakout Log! Let's get this compilation issue resolved and move forward! BOOM Error Resolution! BOOM Compilation Success! LFG! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udde0 Tell me which file you modified, and let's get you compiling again!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
