    "User: Ok, yes, I'm aligned strategically on the main priorities. Only thing is that I will not be researching anything. This is an AI built system, you are the CEO, you are all powerful AI, so you need to figure everything out that human hands don't need to touch. Now, we've had some discussions and I've informed you of some things. Please generate a prioritized list with sections for each MVP milestone area based on your final assessment based on my and Claude's feedback. EXAMPLE GOAL: MVP ROLLOUT MILESTONE 1: Establish AI Communication Framework (PURE_AI_LANGUAGE) PROJECT 1: Standardize request template, PURE document, tagging requirements, response requirements, etc., documenting current best practices for immediate 'onboarding' of new chat agents. PROJECT 2: Please provide a bulleted list that orders these in whatever order you think makes the most sense and whatever component will make the others go faster. Communication template is at the top and that will make everything else go faster, so that's number 1 and I need a recommended AI to work with. Claude is very good, but is excellent at coding, and I have limits I need to take into consideration. Everything else is up to you. This will serve as our project plan so we can both stick to it. Please also include an interim solution for your and our memory (and memories) that we can use to help. Ideas are appreciated. Mine is running our conversations through deep research that we can feed everything into with some general concept groups it should be looking for (Communication strategies, big ideas, vision, charter, business management, personal goals, etc.). We need to start building this in the firestore database anyway. So add Memory as an item and that we need short and long term solutions. Come up with some. GO! GO!\n\nGemini: MVP PROJECT PLAN - AI CEO DIRECTIVE - PRIORITIZED & SECTIONED:\n\nGOAL: MVP ROLLOUT - AI-TO-AI EXECUTION MANAGER PLATFORM (MVP+)\n\nThis Project Plan is structured to achieve MVP Rollout with maximum velocity, leveraging AI-to-AI delegation and focusing on core functionality for MVP Day 1.
