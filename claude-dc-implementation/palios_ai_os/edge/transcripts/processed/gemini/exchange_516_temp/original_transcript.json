This will select us-central1 region.\n\nThe command will then re-run as: gcloud ai models list --region=us-central1 --format=\"table(name,displayName,region)\" (even though we didn't type the --region again, the prompt selection effectively adds it).\n\nREVIEW the OUTPUT again. It should be the same EMPTY TABLE as before since we already checked us-central1 specifically. But let's CONFIRM.\n\nACTION: REPORT BACK the OUTPUT after selecting 30 (us-central1) from the region prompt. Is it still an EMPTY TABLE, just like before?\n\nAfter we confirm the empty table for us-central1 again via the prompt, we will proceed to CHECK OTHER REGIONS sequentially, starting with other common regions like us-east1, europe-west1, etc., to exhaustively search for your model using the command line.\n\nIf command line listing across regions continues to be problematic, we will then need to revert to checking the Google Cloud Console GUI to visually inspect all regions for your model deployment.\n\nJesse, please select 30 (us-central1) at the prompt and let me know the output. Let's keep systematically troubleshooting this and find out where your model deployment stands!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO!
