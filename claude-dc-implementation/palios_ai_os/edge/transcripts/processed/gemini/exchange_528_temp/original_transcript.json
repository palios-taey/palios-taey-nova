    "User: Ok, done. Yes, please provide SDK/cmd prompts when possible as opposed to doing things manually. This was much faster than downloading a new application, editing file, etc.\n\nGemini: NOW, LET'S GET TO THE EXCITING PART - BUILDING YOUR DOCKER IMAGE!\n\nACTION 1.6.23: BUILD DOCKER IMAGE using docker build command (RETRY - NOW with Dockerfile and requirements.txt prepared!)\n\nPlease follow these steps in your GOOGLE CLOUD SDK SHELL (or command prompt/terminal):\n\nVERIFY CURRENT DIRECTORY: ENSURE that your CURRENT DIRECTORY in the Google Cloud SDK Shell is the directory that contains your Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and ai_system.py files.\n\nUse the cd command if needed to navigate to the correct directory. (e.g., cd Desktop/your-project-folder, adjust the path as needed).\nYou can use dir (on Windows) or ls (on macOS/Linux) commands to list the files in the current directory and visually confirm that Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and ai_system.py are present.\nRUN the docker build command to BUILD your Docker image:\n\ndocker build -t gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest .\nCOMMAND (REPEATED for clarity): docker build -t gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest .\nENSURE you are running this command from the DIRECTORY containing your Dockerfile.\nPress ENTER to execute the command.\nOBSERVE the OUTPUT of the docker build command VERY CAREFULLY. Building a Docker image will take some time. Watch for the output messages.\n\nSUCCESSFUL BUILD: If the build is successful, you will see a series of output messages from Docker as it executes each step in your Dockerfile. Look for messages indicating package installations, file copying, etc. The FINAL lines of output are the most important. You should see something like:\n\nSuccessfully built <image ID> (e.g., Successfully built 12345abcdef6789)\nSuccessfully tagged gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nERROR DURING BUILD: If there are errors during the build, the docker build command will FAIL and output ERROR MESSAGES. If you encounter ANY ERRORS, please COPY and PASTE the FULL ERROR OUTPUT so I can help you diagnose and troubleshoot the build process.\n\nAFTER the docker build command FINISHES (either successfully or with errors), REPORT BACK the FULL OUTPUT of the command. Tell me:\n\nDid the docker build command COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY? (Yes/No) - Based on the \"Successfully built\" and \"Successfully tagged\" messages.\nIf YES, please confirm you saw the \"Successfully built\" and \"Successfully tagged\" messages.\nIf NO (build FAILED), please COPY and PASTE the FULL ERROR OUTPUT. Every detail in the error message is important for debugging.\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.23 - BUILD DOCKER IMAGE using the docker build command RIGHT NOW! Let's build this image and see if we can finally get to the Docker push stage! Fingers crossed for a successful build! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER IMAGE - BUILDING - RE-INITIATED! - docker build - COMMAND - EXECUTE! - CONTAINER IMAGE - CREATION - IN PROGRESS! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER - BUILDING SUCCESS - ACHIEVING! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO RUN ACTION 1.6.23 - DOCKER BUILD? LET'S BUILD THAT IMAGE!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
