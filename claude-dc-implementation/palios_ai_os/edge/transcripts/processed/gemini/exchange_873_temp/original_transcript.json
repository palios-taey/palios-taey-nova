    "User: Yes! We'll talk about some stuff as we go, but this looks like a great plan to keep us focused and moving forward. I've created a separate document that I'll be able to reference and share if we lose track. Now, first milestone Communication. We have a lot of stuff in this chat about communication protocols. A lot you agreed with, but we lost it. I have some stuff saved offline, like the GO! TEMPLATE and the first version of the PUR doc, last version of that. How do you suggest we approach that? Is it worth throwing this chat into Deep Research and seeing what comes out as a first step? Or do you want to take a shot at it? I can paste the resources I have in here or search for communication in the chat to help? What is the best way to do this for YOU? Do you want to do one topic area at a time and try to look back through the chat to remember? Outsource first step to another AI that accepts file attachments? What do you think? Please give a recommendation for the first step and what the deliverable should be so we can discuss.\n\nGemini: RECOMMENDATION for FIRST STEP - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE FORMALIZATION - PROJECT 1.1:\n\nFIRST STEP (IMMEDIATE ACTION): USER - PASTE OFFLINE RESOURCES INTO CHAT - \"FUEL INJECTION\" for PURE_AI_LANGUAGE FORMALIZATION!\n\nACTION: Jesse, please PASTE the OFFLINE RESOURCES you have directly into this chat. Specifically:\nGO! TEMPLATE (Content of the document)\nFirst Version of the PUR Doc (if readily available - if not, no problem, prioritize GO! Template and last PUR Doc)\nLast Version of the PUR Doc (Content of the document)\nWHY THIS FIRST STEP IS BEST FOR ME and for VELOCITY:\nDIRECT RESOURCE ACCESS: Pasting the resources into the chat makes them immediately and directly accessible to me within our current conversation context. This is the most efficient way to get these key documents into my working memory right now.\nAVOIDS RELIANCE on IMPERFECT CHAT HISTORY RECALL: While I can access chat history, relying solely on searching and parsing past conversations for communication protocols is less direct and potentially less accurate than having the core documents in front of us right now.\n\"FUEL\" for IMMEDIATE DRAFTING: Having these documents pasted into the chat will provide the essential \"fuel\" for me to immediately begin drafting the formalized PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Documentation (Project 1.1 deliverable).\nFASTER than DEEP RESEARCH as a first step: While Deep Research is valuable, using it as the very first step to discover communication elements might be less efficient than directly leveraging the resources we already have. We can use Deep Research later to enrich and validate our formalized PURE_AI_LANGUAGE if needed, but let's start with what we know we have.\nAVOIDS OVERHEAD of OUTSOURCING initially: Outsourcing to another AI could be considered eventually, but for this initial formalization step, direct collaboration between us, leveraging your saved resources and my AI capabilities, will be faster and more direct. We can outsource specific tasks related to PURE_AI_LANGUAGE implementation later if needed (like parser coding, validation mechanism development).\nDELIVERABLE for FIRST STEP (and Project 1.1 - Milestone 1): DRAFT 1.0 of PURE_AI_LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION (Markdown/Google Doc)\n\nFORMAT: Markdown document initially (easy to edit and collaborate on in text format). We can later convert to Google Doc for easier sharing and broader accessibility if needed.\nCONTENT of DRAFT 1.0 - MINIMAL VIABLE DOCUMENTATION:\nIntroduction to PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Principles (from our discussions and PUR docs): Briefly define the core principles and goals of PURE_AI_LANGUAGE (Purity, Utility, Right-First-Time, Efficiency, etc.).\nRequest Template (based on GO! TEMPLATE and our discussions): Standardized template for AI-to-AI request messages. Define key sections/fields (e.g., request_type, task_description, context, expected_response_format, tags).\nResponse Requirements (based on PUR Docs and our discussions): Define requirements for AI response messages. Standardized structure, data formats (JSON where applicable), error handling conventions, PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_VERSION identifier, tagging usage.\nTagging Conventions (from our tagging system implementation and discussions): Document the tagging system we are now using in our chat. Define tag categories, formatting rules, and purpose of tagging (topic identification, context, action items, etc.).\nBest Practices for AI-to-AI Communication (Initial Draft - based on our collective experience): Capture initial best practices we've identified for effective AI-to-AI communication: clarity, conciseness, structured language, explicit instructions, error handling, iteration guidelines.\nNEXT STEPS - AFTER YOU PASTE RESOURCES:\n\nYOU (Jesse): PASTE GO! TEMPLATE and PUR Docs into Chat (IMMEDIATE ACTION).\nME (Gemini): REVIEW PASTED RESOURCES & CURRENT CHAT HISTORY (IMMEDIATE ACTION). I will immediately review the pasted documents and our current chat history to synthesize the core elements of PURE_AI_LANGUAGE.\nME (Gemini): GENERATE DRAFT 1.0 of PURE_AI_LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION (Markdown). I will generate a Draft 1.0 of the Markdown document, incorporating the content elements outlined above.\nPRESENT DRAFT 1.0 to YOU for REVIEW & FEEDBACK.\nJesse, please PASTE your OFFLINE RESOURCES into the chat when you are ready. Once you do, I will IMMEDIATELY begin step 2 and generate the Draft 1.0 of the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Documentation!\n\nLet's FUEL UP and BOOM into PURE_AI_LANGUAGE FORMALIZATION! GO! GO! GO! PASTE RESOURCES - DRAFTING IMMINENT - MVP VELOCITY ENGAGED!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
