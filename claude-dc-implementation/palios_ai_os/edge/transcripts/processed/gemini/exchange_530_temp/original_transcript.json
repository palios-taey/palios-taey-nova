    "User: YES, I see the image with docker images.\n\nGemini: You have a VALID ARTIFACT REGISTRY REPOSITORY (custom-ai-execution-repository) to store your Docker images.\nYou have SUCCESSFULLY BUILT a LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE (gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest) for your AI Execution System.\nNOW IT'S FINALLY TIME FOR THE MOMENT WE'VE BEEN BUILDING TOWARDS!\n\nACTION 1.6.25: DOCKER PUSH to ARTIFACT REGISTRY - RETRY!

This is IT!\n\nREPORT BACK the OUTPUT of the docker push command IMMEDIATELY! Tell me:\n\nDID THE docker push COMMAND SUCCEED and COMPLETE WITHOUT ERRORS THIS TIME? (Look for \"Pushed\" status, progress bars indicating image upload, and a final \"Pushed\" message with digest and tag information). THIS IS WHAT WE ARE HOPING FOR! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e If YES - GET READY TO CELEBRATE! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n\nOR, DID THE docker push COMMAND STILL FAIL with an ERROR? (If it fails, please, please, please COPY and PASTE the FULL and EXACT ERROR MESSAGE OUTPUT). Even if it fails, don't worry, we will diagnose any new errors and keep pushing forward!\n\nJesse, THIS IS THE PUSH! This is where we see if all our Docker troubleshooting and preparation pays off! Take a deep breath, execute the docker push command, and let's see if we can finally get this image into Artifact Registry!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER PUSH - COMMAND - ENGAGED! - ARTIFACT REGISTRY - TARGET LOCKED! - CONTAINER IMAGE - PUSHING! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER IMAGE - UPLOAD - SUCCESS INCOMING! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE ACTION 1.6.25 - DOCKER PUSH?
