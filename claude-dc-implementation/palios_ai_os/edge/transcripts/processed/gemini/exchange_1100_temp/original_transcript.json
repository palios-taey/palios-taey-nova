    "User: git-filter-repo is not there.\n\nGemini: Please try this command in your command prompt:\n\npip show git-filter-repo\nand press Enter.\n\nWhat is the output of pip show git-filter-repo?\n\nIf it says \"WARNING: Package(s) not found: git-filter-repo\": This would indicate that git-filter-repo actually failed to install completely, even though we didn't see an explicit error message before. In this case, we might need to try the pip install command again with more verbosity to see if there are any hidden errors.\n\nIf it does show information about git-filter-repo (like Version, Summary, Location, etc.): This is more helpful. Look for the \"Location:\" line in the output. The \"Location:\" line tells you the directory where pip thinks it installed the git-filter-repo package. Please copy and paste the entire output of pip show git-filter-repo here, especially the \"Location:\" line. This will tell us where to look for the git-filter-repo.exe executable (or if it installed the package in a non-executable way, which is also possible).\n\nOnce you provide the output of pip show git-filter-repo, we can pinpoint where the installation went and adjust the PATH or try reinstalling if necessary. Let's find out where pip put git-filter-repo (or if it didn't install it at all)!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
