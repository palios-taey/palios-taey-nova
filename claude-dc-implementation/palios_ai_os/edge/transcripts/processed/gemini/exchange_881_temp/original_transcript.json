    "User: Ok, go with it. It's late here though, and I'm not up for coding debugging quite yet. Go ahead and draft the message now though since its fresh in your memory and I can send in the morning and get started on it. Claude seems to be pretty creative, so try to let him run with it. He likes to complete it and then make a few suggestions. Or, just be conceptual with it and let him figure it out. We've developed a lot of stuff that you don't remember on communication. Here is a screenshot from that folder of the scripts so you can get an idea. Let's see the draft. GO!\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_a906bc.png\n\nGemini: [PLACEHOLDER - Link to stored Draft 1.1 Document - Jesse to provide]: Replace this with the actual link or reference to where you have stored the \"PURE_AI_LANGUAGE - Standard Request/Response Template - Draft 1.1.md\" document.\n[PLACEHOLDER - Jesse to provide if needed]: If you want to set a deadline for Claude for this parser implementation task, add it here in ISO 8601 format (e.g., \"2023-10-27T12:00:00Z\"). If no specific deadline, you can leave this placeholder or remove the deadline field entirely.\nOnce you've updated the placeholders, you can COPY and PASTE this JSON message and send it to CLAUDE in our chat to DELEGATE PROJECT 1.2 - PARSER IMPLEMENTATION!\n\nLet me know if you have any adjustments or feedback on this draft before sending! Otherwise, we are ready to LAUNCH PROJECT 1.2 with BOOM VELOCITY in the morning! GO! GO! GO! DRAFT REQUEST MESSAGE - READY - CLAUDE DELEGATION IMMINENT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
