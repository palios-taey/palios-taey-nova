    "User: It's requiring a service account\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_b33e9e.png\n\nGemini: [ACTION_TAG] Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts\n\n[ACTION_TAG] Find Cloud Build Service Account: Look for a service account that looks like this: [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com (Replace [PROJECT_NUMBER] with your actual GCP project number - 711898853198 based on the image you shared previously.) It might be listed as \"Compute Engine default service account\".\n\n[ACTION_TAG] Check Service Account Permissions (Roles): Click on the service account email address to see its details and \"Permissions\" tab.\n\n[EXPECTED_ROLES_TAG] Expected Roles (Minimum for Cloud Run deployment): The Cloud Build service account must have at least these roles to deploy to Cloud Run:\n\nCloud Run Admin: (Essential for deploying and managing Cloud Run services)\n(Potentially) Artifact Registry Reader/Writer or Storage Admin: (Needed for pulling and pushing Docker images. Artifact Registry is newer and recommended over Storage)\n[MISSING_ROLES_TAG] If Roles are Missing or Insufficient:\n\n[ACTION_TAG] Click \"Grant Access\" at the top of the Service Account Permissions page.\n[ACTION_TAG] Add Principal: In the \"New principals\" field, enter the email address of the Cloud Build service account you found in step 2 (e.g., 711898853198-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com).\n[ACTION_TAG] Select a Role: Choose the necessary role from the \"Select a role\" dropdown. Start by adding \"Cloud Run Admin\". If you encounter issues later related to image permissions, you might need to add \"Artifact Registry Reader\" and \"Artifact Registry Writer\" or (less recommended) \"Storage Admin\".\n[ACTION_TAG] Click \"Save\".\n[CONCISE_INSTRUCTIONS_TAG] Concise Steps - Service Account Check & Configuration:\n\nIAM & Admin > Service Accounts.\nFind [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com (Compute Engine default).\nClick on email, go to \"Permissions\".\nVerify Roles: \"Cloud Run Admin\" (and potentially \"Artifact Registry Reader/Writer\" or \"Storage Admin\").\nIf missing roles: \"Grant Access\", add service account email as principal, select missing roles, \"Save\".\n[NEXT_STEP_TAG] Action: Please check the Cloud Build service account roles and add \"Cloud Run Admin\" if it's missing. Let me know the roles currently assigned and if you needed to add any! Then we can re-try creating the Cloud Build trigger.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
