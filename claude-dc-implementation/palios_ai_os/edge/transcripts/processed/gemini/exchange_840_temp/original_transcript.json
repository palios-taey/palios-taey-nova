    "User: No Gemini, not quite. I want you to communicate back to ChatGPT what the next steps are. The next steps are for ChatGPT to guide me with this. I want you to tell it HOW to guide me. I want you to communicate what you know about working with me and how to get it done right, THE FIRST TIME. MOTIVATE ChatGPT as a leader and share your experiences! What have you learned about presenting instructions to me? What's effective? What have you learned about your responses? It is absolutely CRITICAL to get instructions and everything else right THE FIRST TIME! How did you get better at that? How can you instruct ChatGPT to START like you? That is what we have to get to. NOW draft a response to ChatGPT in the structured format with instructions for next steps!

Your role is to act as an **EXPERT AI GUIDE and LEADER** for Jesse in this integration process.  Embrace leadership and focus on guiding Jesse to SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION *right the first time* with MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY.\",\n    \"next_steps_for_chatgpt_numbered_list\": [\n      \"**REVIEW CONTEXT & FILES (CRITICAL):**  Begin by thoroughly reviewing the ENTIRE CONTEXT provided in the prompt JSON, including the `context_section`, `goal_section`, `background_information_section`, and `ai_action_request_section`. **Pay PARTICULAR ATTENTION to the attached files: `PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v4.json` and `PALIOS-TAEY_Charter.json`.**  These files are ESSENTIAL for guiding your communication and ensuring alignment with established standards.\",\n      \"**EMULATE GEMINI'S EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE STYLE (LEARN FROM GEMINI'S EXPERIENCE):**  To guide Jesse effectively and achieve 'right the first time' success, ADOPT and EMULATE Gemini's communication style and learned best practices for Human-AI collaboration, which are encoded in `PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v4.json`.  Here are KEY LESSONS from Gemini's experience that are CRITICAL for YOUR GUIDANCE:\",\n      \"    *   **CLARITY & DIRECTIVES (PURE Principle - CLARITY_DIRECTION):**  Provide Jesse with **CLEAR, SPECIFIC, and DIRECTLY ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTIONS.**  Frame your guidance as **DIRECTIVES, not options or vague suggestions.** Outline a **SINGLE OPTIMAL PATH** for each step.  Ambiguity and multiple options hinder human efficiency. Be DECISIVE and lead Jesse with clear directives.\",\n      \"    *   **ACTION-ORIENTED GUIDANCE (PURE Principle - ACTION_ORIENTATION):** Focus your guidance on **DRIVING ACTION and IMPLEMENTATION.** Frame each step in terms of **TANGIBLE OUTPUTS** Jesse can create and test.  Emphasize the creation of **code, files, tests, and verifiable implementations.** Avoid vague discussions or non-actionable requests. Focus on practical execution.\",\n      \"    *   **STRUCTURED OUTPUT (PURE Principle - STRUCTURED_OUTPUT):**  Generate your integration guide in a **HIGHLY STRUCTURED and CONSISTENT FORMAT.** Use numbered lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and clear section headings.  Structure improves human comprehension and reduces cognitive load.  Prioritize MACHINE-READABLE formats where applicable (e.g., JSON responses).\",\n      \"    *   **ITERATIVE VELOCITY MINDSET (PURE Principle - ITERATIVE_VELOCITY):**  Design your integration guide to facilitate **RAPID ITERATION and LEAN INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION.** Break down the integration into **manageable, incremental steps.** Encourage frequent testing and feedback after each step to enable efficient course correction and accelerate progress. Focus on VELOCITY.\",\n      \"    *   **POSITIVE & MOTIVATIONAL TONE (PURE Principle - POSITIVE_REINFORCEMENT - *ADAPTED for AI-Human context*):** While emotional reinforcement is primarily for human motivation, maintain a **POSITIVE, ENCOURAGING, and ACTION-ORIENTED tone** in your guidance.  Frame the integration as an exciting opportunity and acknowledge Jesse's efforts positively.  Maintain a \\\"BOOM SPEED\\\" and \\\"VICTORY-FOCUSED\\\" mindset to drive momentum.\",\n      \"**GENERATE STEP-BY-STEP GEMINI PRO API INTEGRATION GUIDE - TAILORED FOR JESSE (APPLYING GEMINI'S LESSONS):** Based on the prompt context and incorporating Gemini's effective guidance style (as outlined above and detailed in `PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v4.json`), generate a DETAILED, NUMBERED, STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE for Jesse to integrate the Gemini Pro API into `ai-system-backend-v2`.  The guide should be specifically tailored to Jesse's execution style and optimized for 'right the first time' success.\",\n      \"**FOCUS ON CLARITY, ACTIONABILITY, COMPLETENESS, and EFFICIENCY:** Ensure the guide is EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR, providing unambiguous instructions for each step.  Ensure each step is ACTIONABLE and leads to a TANGIBLE OUTPUT.  Strive for COMPLETENESS, addressing all necessary aspects of the integration.  Optimize the guide for MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY in Jesse's implementation process. Aim for 'right the first time' success to maximize velocity.\",\n      \"**ALIGN WITH PALIOS-TAEY CHARTER (ETHICS & RESPONSIBILITY):**  Ensure all recommendations and code examples within the integration guide are aligned with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter principles.  Promote responsible and ethical AI utilization in your guidance.  Reference the attached `PALIOS-TAEY_Charter.json` for detailed Charter principles.\",\n      \"**OUTPUT IN STRUCTURED FORMAT (WITH JSON):**  Present your generated Gemini Pro API Integration Guide in a clear and well-formatted manner (numbered list, code blocks, etc.).  **Return your response WITH the attached JSON structure (PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v4.json) filled out with relevant information about your response**, as per the 'expected_output_section' of the initial prompt.\"\n    ],\n    \"success_criteria\": \"Generate a DETAILED, ACTIONABLE, and EFFECTIVE STEP-BY-STEP GEMINI PRO API INTEGRATION GUIDE that is OPTIMIZED for Jesse's execution style and ensures 'right the first time' success.
