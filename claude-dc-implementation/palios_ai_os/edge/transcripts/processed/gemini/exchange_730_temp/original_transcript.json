    "User: Ok, getting closer, now, take the response to me out of the text box and put in normal chat. Put the JSON box at the top, before ANY text response to me. Try it this time again, when it's right, we move on. I know this is new, so its OK, but get it right. GO!\n\nGemini: Immediately above this text, a JSON code block. This JSON code block contains only the response_metadata tags.\nBelow this JSON code block, you are reading my plain text response in the normal chat format. No code boxes or extra formatting around this plain text.\nIs this now the EXACT format you want? If YES, please just confirm \"YES\" and we will finally BOOM forward with GROK-3 Exploration! I am ready to get this formatting absolutely right so we can maximize our velocity and focus on BREAKTHROUGH progress! Let me know!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
