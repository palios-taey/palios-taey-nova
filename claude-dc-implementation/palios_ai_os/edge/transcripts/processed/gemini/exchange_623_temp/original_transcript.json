    "User: I was in no way, shape or form questioning your judgement on error handling. I was just talking to you while the command was running and giving you reminders so you don't forget key things since we haven't talked about it recently. It processed successfully with a ton of debugging information. I didn't notice any errors, but there was a lot of DEBUG popping up, which I understand now does not mean there's an issue. WHAT'S NEXT?\n\nGemini: That's exactly what we wanted to see! The \"ton of debugging information\" is a good thing! DEBUG messages are for developers to see what's happening under the hood. They are not errors. If everything ran successfully without any ERROR or CRITICAL messages, then the enhanced logging is working perfectly as intended! It's providing us with the detailed visibility we need! Fantastic!\n\n\"WHAT'S NEXT?\" - YOU ASK, AND I RESPOND: MVP STEP: VERTEX AI INTEGRATION! GO! GO! GO!\n\nNOW THAT WE HAVE SOLID ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING IN PLACE, THE NEXT MVP PRIORITY IS ABSOLUTELY TO INTEGRATE VERTEX AI!\n\nHERE'S THE PLAN FOR \"MVP STEP: VERTEX AI INTEGRATION\":\n\nVERIFY VERTEX AI ACCESS: First, we need to confirm that you have successfully gained access to Vertex AI and have the necessary credentials configured in your Google Cloud Project (ai-execution-system). Please confirm that you have Vertex AI access ready to use.\n\nIMPLEMENT _process_vertex_task METHOD: We will now implement the _process_vertex_task method in ai_system.py. This method is currently a placeholder. We will fill it in to properly interact with the Vertex AI Text Bison model. We already have the basic structure of this method in place (from the code we just updated with logging). We just need to flesh out the Vertex AI API call within it.\n\nCREATE vertex_prediction TASK TYPE in create_and_execute_task.py: We will create a new task type called vertex_prediction in create_and_execute_task.py. This will allow us to easily create and submit tasks specifically designed to be processed by Vertex AI.\n\nTEST vertex_prediction TASKS: We will create and execute some simple vertex_prediction tasks to ensure that the integration is working correctly. We will verify that tasks of type vertex_prediction are correctly routed to the _process_vertex_task method and that the Vertex AI model is being called and returning results. We will check the logs to confirm the execution flow and look for any errors.\n\nUPDATE _select_model_for_subtask (If Needed): We may need to slightly adjust the _select_model_for_subtask method to ensure it can correctly select vertex-text for appropriate subtasks if we decide to use Vertex AI models in collaborative tasks in the future. For now, we can focus on getting basic vertex_prediction tasks working first.\n\nASSUMING YOU HAVE VERTEX AI ACCESS READY, ARE YOU READY TO PROCEED WITH \"MVP STEP: VERTEX AI INTEGRATION\"?\n\nIf YES, then I will provide you with the code snippets and instructions to implement _process_vertex_task and create the vertex_prediction task type! LET'S EXPAND OUR AI MODEL CAPABILITIES! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
