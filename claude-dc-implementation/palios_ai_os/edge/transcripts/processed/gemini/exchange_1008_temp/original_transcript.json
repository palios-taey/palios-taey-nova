    "User: Ok, Gemini, we are going through a lot of cycles on this. Hours. What is the fix? One more shot then we have to outsource. jesse@DESKTOP-13JMJ93 MINGW64 /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform (temp-orphan) $ terraform destroy -auto-approve \u2577 \u2502 Error: Unsupported block type \u2502 \u2502   on main.tf line 136, in resource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\": \u2502  136:     retry_config { \u2502 \u2502 Blocks of type \"retry_config\" are not expected here. \u2575 jesse@DESKTOP-13JMJ93 MINGW64 /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform (temp-orphan)\n\nGemini: Here's what you need to do:\n\nReplace the ENTIRE content of your main.tf file with this VERY SIMPLIFIED code:\n\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    google = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/google\"\n      version = \"6.20.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"project_id\" {\n  description = \"GCP Project ID\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"ai-execution-system\" # Replace with your actual Project ID if different\n}\n\nvariable \"region\" {\n  description = \"GCP region\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"us-central1\"\n}\n\nvariable \"service_name\" {\n  type    = string\n  default = \"ai-execution-system-core\"\n}\n\n\nresource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" {\n  project   = var.project_id\n  region    = var.region\n  name      = \"${var.service_name}-healthcheck\"\n  schedule  = \"*/5 * * * *\"\n  time_zone = \"UTC\"\n  http_target {\n    http_method = \"GET\"\n    uri         = \"https://example.com/health\" # Placeholder URI for now\n  }\n}\nIMPORTANT: COPY and PASTE this entire code block to completely replace your existing main.tf content.\n\nSAVE the main.tf file.\n\nRun terraform init -upgrade AGAIN in Git Bash:\n\nterraform init -upgrade\nRun terraform plan AGAIN in Git Bash:\n\nterraform plan\nWhat we are trying to achieve with this simplified main.tf:\n\nEliminate retry_config: We've removed the retry_config block entirely from the google_cloud_scheduler_job definition.\nSimplified http_target: We've used a placeholder URI (https://example.com/health) in http_target to make it as basic as possible.\nMinimal Required Configuration: This main.tf now defines the bare minimum needed for a Cloud Scheduler job with an HTTP target, without any complex or potentially problematic configurations like retry_config.\nWhat we expect to happen:\n\nIf terraform plan RUNS SUCCESSFULLY (without the \"Unsupported block type\" error): This will strongly indicate that the problem IS related to the retry_config block or how Terraform is processing it in your environment. If terraform plan works with this simplified main.tf, we will then know we need to investigate the retry_config configuration more deeply.\nIf terraform plan STILL FAILS with the \"Unsupported block type\" error: This would be very surprising, as we've removed the block that Terraform was complaining about. If it still fails, it might indicate a more fundamental issue, such as:\nA more general syntax error in main.tf that is somehow manifesting as a misleading \"retry_config\" error.\nA deeper problem with your Terraform installation, provider installation, or environment.\nAfter you have replaced main.tf with the simplified code, run terraform init -upgrade and terraform plan, please tell me:\n\nDid terraform init -upgrade complete successfully?\nDid terraform plan complete successfully WITHOUT the \"Unsupported block type\" error? This is the most important question.\nPaste the entire output of terraform plan.\nLet's focus all our efforts on this one last, highly targeted test. We will get to the bottom of this! You are doing great in a very challenging situation! LFG! Let's make this one count!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
