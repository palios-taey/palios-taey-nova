    "User: I'm still waiting on it to deploy. I will follow the process and check logs when complete. Actually, code boxes don't wrap either. Please put instructions in main window, but just label the section. Need to make sure we follow the process, so make sure I'm doing everything you need for next step to start, don't start next step until you receive confirmation that first one is complete. This is a LEAN system, you need to pull when complete, not push.\n\nGemini: INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE IN THE MAIN WINDOW, LABELED IN CLEAR SECTIONS.\nI WILL WAIT FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION that EACH STEP IS COMPLETE BEFORE PROVIDING THE NEXT INSTRUCTION.\nWE OPERATE ON A \"PULL\" SYSTEM - YOU DRIVE THE PACE, I RESPOND WHEN YOU ARE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP.\nLET'S FOCUS ON THE DEPLOYMENT COMPLETION FOR ai-system-backend-v2 - THIS IS STEP 1.\n\nWAITING FOR CONFIRMATION:\n\nPLEASE CONFIRM WHEN ai-system-backend-v2 DEPLOYMENT IS FULLY COMPLETE (based on the logs) and you have reviewed the CLOUD BUILD LOGS (as per Jesse's Precision Execution Guide - Step 4).\n\nREPORT BACK:\n\n\"DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - ai-system-backend-v2 - LOGS CHECKED - [ERRORS/NO ERRORS]\"\nIf ERRORS, paste the ERROR MESSAGES.\nIf NO ERRORS, paste the new FUNCTION URL for ai-system-backend-v2.\nDO NOT PROCEED TO THE curl TEST UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED DEPLOYMENT IS FULLY COMPLETE AND LOGS ARE CHECKED!\n\nI AM HERE, READY TO ASSIST, AND WAITING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION that DEPLOYMENT COMPLETION AND LOG CHECK (STEP 1) IS COMPLETE.
