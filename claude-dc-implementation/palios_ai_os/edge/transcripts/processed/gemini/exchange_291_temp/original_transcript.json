    "User: The folder with all the charter stuff is just called 'charter'\n\nGemini: Here is the corrected firestore_upload_script.py code (Version 8), with the charter_folder variable updated to \"charter\":\n\n(Please replace the entire content of your current firestore_upload_script.py file with the code below):\n\nimport firebase_admin\nfrom firebase_admin import credentials\nfrom firebase_admin import firestore\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom palios_logger import PaliosLogger  # Import PaliosLogger\n\n# --- Configuration ---\n# Firebase Admin SDK setup\ncred = credentials.Certificate(\"C:/AI-Execution-System/firebase_key.json\") # CORRECTED KEY PATH - to your firebase_key.json file\nfirebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)\ndb = firestore.client()\n\n# Path to the folder containing Charter section JSON files\ncharter_folder = \"charter\" # CORRECTED FOLDER NAME to \"charter\" - to match your actual folder name\n\n# --- Initialize Logging ---\nlogger = PaliosLogger()  # Instantiate PaliosLogger\n\n# --- Main Script Logic ---\ndef upload_charter_sections():\n    \"\"\"Uploads Charter sections from JSON files to Firestore.\"\"\"\n\n    logger.log_event(  # Log script startup (using PaliosLogger)\n        event_type=\"STARTUP\",\n        category=\"system\",\n        message=\"Firestore upload script starting\",\n        data={\"script_name\": \"firestore_upload_script.py\"}\n    )\n    print(\"Starting Firestore upload script...\") # Keep temporary print for immediate console feedback during dev - will remove later\n\n    # --- Corrected path handling for charter_folder ---\n    script_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # Get directory of the script\n    full_charter_folder_path = os.path.join(script_directory, charter_folder) # Construct full path\n\n    try: # Wrap folder listing in a try-except to catch folder not found\n        section_files = [f for f in os.listdir(full_charter_folder_path) if f.endswith('.json')]\n        section_files.sort() # Ensure sections are processed in order if filenames are numerically prefixed\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        error_message = f\"Charter sections folder not found at: {full_charter_folder_path}.

With the folder name corrected, you should now expect to see:\n\n\"Starting Firestore upload script...\"\n\"Uploaded section ...\" messages for each Charter section successfully uploaded to Firestore.\n\"Firestore upload script completed.\"\nNo FileNotFoundError!\nVerify Log Files in logs Folder: Check your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\logs folder, specifically the system_logger.log file. You should now see log events for:\n\nevent_type=\"STARTUP\"(Script start)\nevent_type=\"UPLOAD_SUCCESS\" for each section successfully uploaded.\nevent_type=\"SHUTDOWN\"(Script completion)\nReport Results - Let me know if it finally works without errors!: Please report back the results after running Version 8. Tell me specifically if it ran without any errors this time, and if the Charter sections were uploaded successfully to Firestore! Also, confirm if you see the expected log events in system_logger.log.\n\nWith this correction to the folder name, I am very hopeful that Version 8 will finally run successfully and upload your Charter sections to Firestore with logging! Please test it out and let me know the great news! \ud83c\udf89\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
