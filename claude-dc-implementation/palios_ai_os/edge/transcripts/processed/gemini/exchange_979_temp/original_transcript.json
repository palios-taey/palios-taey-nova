    "User: No, I just pasted the top. It has the full code. is the '''bash at the top of min the issue?\n\nGemini: '''bash should NOT be in your deploy.sh file. You should NOT include '''bash or the closing triple backticks ''' in the actual deploy.sh file itself. These are just formatting delimiters for displaying code in text.\n\nThe correct first line of a Bash script is #!/bin/bash. The actual deploy.sh script should start with the line #!/bin/bash (as it does in the code you just pasted). This line is called the \"shebang\" and tells the operating system that this file is a Bash script and should be executed using the Bash interpreter. The #!/bin/bash line IS correct and necessary.\n\nReviewing the deploy.sh code you pasted:\n\nThe code you pasted for deploy.sh looks like a valid and well-structured Bash script.\n\nIt starts with #!/bin/bash - CORRECT.\nIt defines color variables and helper functions - STANDARD PRACTICE in shell scripts.\nIt includes functions for checking prerequisites, configuring GCP, API keys, Terraform init/plan/apply, and a main deploy function - LOGICAL STRUCTURE for a deployment script.\nBased on the content you just provided, the deploy.sh script itself looks generally correct in terms of its structure and header.\n\nThe fact that it's not producing any output when you run it (even with bash deploy.sh) is still puzzling. Since the script content seems okay, let's go back to the next crucial debugging step:\n\nAction - Run bash -x deploy.sh (DEBUG MODE) again and carefully examine the output:\n\nPlease run this command in Git Bash again:\n\nbash -x deploy.sh\nAnd this time, VERY CAREFULLY observe and record ANY output at all. Even if it's just a tiny bit of output, or if it produces error messages, please copy and paste the ENTIRE OUTPUT you see after running bash -x deploy.sh.\n\nThe -x option will trace the script execution step-by-step, showing us each command before it's executed. This will be extremely helpful in pinpointing where the script might be failing or exiting prematurely.\n\nLet's focus on getting the output from bash -x deploy.sh. Provide me with that output, and we'll analyze it together to diagnose the issue. LFG! We're making progress in understanding the situation.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
