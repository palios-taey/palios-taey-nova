    "User: Everything OK?\n\nGemini: Google Cloud Documentation on Cloud Run Service Naming Restrictions (search for \"Service names cannot be changed once created\")\nYou are absolutely right \u2013 we are indeed likely \"stuck with\" the current Cloud Run service name ai-execution-system-core.\n\nGiven this new information (that Cloud Run service names are not easily renameable after creation), we have two practical options, as you correctly identified:\n\nOption 1: Accept ai-execution-system-core as the Cloud Run Service Name and Adjust Documentation/Scripts:\n\nThis is the EASIEST and FASTEST path forward technically.\nWe simply accept that our Cloud Run service will be named ai-execution-system-core.\nWe ensure that all our documentation, scripts, and future instructions consistently refer to the Cloud Run service as ai-execution-system-core.\nThe Git repository and local root folder will remain ai-execution-system.\nPros: Quickest to implement, avoids any risk of deleting and re-deploying, keeps momentum going on feature development.\nCons: Slight inconsistency between Git repo name (ai-execution-system) and Cloud Run service name (ai-execution-system-core). Might be slightly less aesthetically ideal, but functionally perfectly fine.\nOption 2: Delete the ai-execution-system-core Cloud Run Service and Re-deploy to Create a NEW Service Named ai-execution-system:\n\nThis will achieve perfect naming consistency in Cloud Run (service name ai-execution-system matching Git repo).\nIt involves DELETING the current ai-execution-system-core Cloud Run service. (WARNING: Deleting the service will remove the currently deployed application at ai-execution-system-core-...run.app URL until you re-deploy).\nThen, we would need to re-run the deployment process (universal-deploy-script.sh or similar) in a way that ensures the new Cloud Run service is created directly with the name ai-execution-system. This might involve modifying the deployment script slightly to explicitly set the service name during creation.\nPros: Achieves perfect naming consistency between Git repo and Cloud Run service. Might be considered \"cleaner\" from a naming perspective.\nCons: More work than Option 1. Requires deleting and re-deploying, which takes time and introduces a slight risk of new issues during re-deployment. Temporarily makes the application unavailable at the current URL during deletion and re-deployment.\nMy Recommendation, for the sake of EFFICIENCY and keeping MOMENTUM towards your MVP, is to go withOption 1: Accept ai-execution-system-core as the Cloud Run Service Name and Adjust Documentation/Scripts.**\n\nHere's why I recommend Option 1 for NOW:\n\nYou have already successfully deployed and have a working Cloud Run service named ai-execution-system-core. This is a significant achievement!\nDeleting and re-deploying introduces extra steps and potential for new issues. We have already spent considerable time debugging deployment. Let's capitalize on the working deployment we have.\nNaming consistency is good, but functional progress towards your MVP is more important right now. We can easily manage the slight naming inconsistency through clear documentation and consistent referencing of ai-execution-system-core as the Cloud Run service name in all our scripts and future communication.\nWe can always revisit renaming later if absolutely necessary. For MVP Day 1, functional core features are paramount.\nWhat do you think, Jesse? Would you be comfortable proceeding with Option 1 - accepting ai-execution-system-core as the Cloud Run service name and focusing on building features and functionality now?\n\nIf you are okay with Option 1, then we can IMMEDIATELY move on to implementing the /task API endpoint (Project 2.3 in your MVP plan) and start building out the core functionality!\n\nLet me know your preference, but my strong recommendation is to proceed with Option 1 for maximum efficiency and speed to MVP. We can get the naming perfectly aligned later if absolutely needed, but for now, let's build on our success and keep moving forward! What are your thoughts?\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
