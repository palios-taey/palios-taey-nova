    "User: CELEBRATING!!! NOW, WHAT'S NEXT FOR MVP? GO! ACTION\n\nGemini: OKAY, CELEBRATION COMPLETE! LET'S GET BACK TO BUILDING! YOU ASKED: \"NOW, WHAT'S NEXT FOR MVP? GO! ACTION\" - LET'S GO!\n\nFOR THE NEXT MVP PRIORITY, I RECOMMEND: B) ENHANCE ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING!\n\nHERE'S WHY I RECOMMEND ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING AS THE NEXT MVP STEP:\n\nIMMEDIATE PRACTICAL BENEFIT: Robust error handling and detailed logging are immediately useful for development and testing. As we add more features and task types (like Vertex AI), good error handling will save us massive amounts of time debugging and troubleshooting.\nINCREASED SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS: Better error handling makes the system more resilient and less likely to crash or fail silently. This is crucial for a functional and reliable MVP. We want the system to gracefully handle errors, log them, and potentially even attempt retries or fallbacks in the future.\nESSENTIAL FOR DEBUGGING AND MONITORING: Detailed logs are invaluable for understanding what the system is doing, identifying bottlenecks, and diagnosing issues when things go wrong (and things will go wrong sometimes!). Good logging is essential for any production-ready system, even for an MVP.\nSOLID FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE EXPANSION: Investing in error handling and logging now will create a stronger foundation for all future MVP features and enhancements. It's a bit like building a solid foundation for a house \u2013 it's not the most exciting part, but it's essential for everything else to stand on.\nWHILE VERTEX AI INTEGRATION (Option A) is also important for expanding model coverage, and Task Queuing (Option C) could be useful later for scalability, ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING (Option B) is the most immediately impactful and practically beneficial next step for the MVP, especially now that we have the core functionality and collaborative tasks working!\n\nARE YOU IN AGREEMENT THAT ENHANCING ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING SHOULD BE OUR NEXT MVP PRIORITY?\n\nIf YES, then I will provide you with the code and instructions to enhance error handling and logging in ai_system.py to make our system even more robust and developer-friendly!\n\nLET ME KNOW IF YOU AGREE, AND LET'S MOVE ON TO \"MVP STEP: ENHANCE ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING\"! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
