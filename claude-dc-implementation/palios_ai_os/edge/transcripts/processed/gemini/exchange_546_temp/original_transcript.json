    "User: Directive accepted! Look ok?\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_cd03e2.png\n\nGemini: Overall Assessment: Close, but a few KEY ADJUSTMENTS RECOMMENDED for optimal ENDPOINT DEPLOYMENT (as opposed to TRAINING).\n\nHere's a STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN and ACTION PLAN for the \"Compute settings\" page:\n\n\"Region: us-central1 (Iowa)\" - PERFECT! KEEP as is! us-central1 is the correct region, so leave this setting as it is. \u2705\n\n\"Compute settings\" Section - CRITICAL ADJUSTMENT!\n\n**CURRENTLY SELECTED: \"Add to existing persistent resource\" - RECOMMENDATION: SWITCH to \"Deploy to new worker pool\" **\n\nWHY SWITCH? \"Persistent resources\" in Vertex AI are primarily designed to REDUCE STARTUP TIME for TRAINING JOBS by pre-provisioning compute resources. The description in the UI even mentions \"running a job on an existing persistent resource will eliminate the job startup time that's otherwise needed for compute resource creation.\"\nWE are deploying an ENDPOINT for ONLINE PREDICTION (or AI Execution), NOT running a TRAINING JOB. Using a persistent resource for an endpoint deployment is likely unnecessary and might introduce extra complexity or cost that we don't need for this scenario.\nRECOMMENDED ACTION: CLICK the RADIO BUTTON for \"Deploy to new worker pool\" instead of \"Add to existing persistent resource.\" This will ensure that Vertex AI provisions compute resources specifically for your endpoint deployment, which is the standard and recommended approach for online prediction endpoints.\n*\"Persistent resource \" - After switching to \"Deploy to new worker pool,\" this section will become IRRELEVANT and you can IGNORE it. It is only active when \"Add to existing persistent resource\" is selected.\n\n\"Worker pool 0 (chief)\" - MACHINE TYPE RE-EVALUATION - ADJUSTMENT SUGGESTED!\n\n*\"Worker pool \": Currently set to \"n1-standard-4\" - RECOMMENDATION: CONSIDER switching to \"e2-medium\" or even \"e2-small\" for INITIAL ENDPOINT DEPLOYMENT.\n\n\"n1-standard-4\" is a GENERAL-PURPOSE MACHINE TYPE and will WORK, but it might be slightly more expensive than necessary for an initial endpoint deployment, especially for testing.\n\"e2-medium\" or \"e2-small\" MACHINE TYPES (from the E2 series - cost-optimized) are often SUFFICIENT and MORE COST-EFFECTIVE for many initial Vertex AI endpoint deployments, particularly for applications that are not extremely computationally intensive. We recommended e2-medium earlier (Action 1.6.29, Step 5).\nRECOMMENDED ACTION: *CLICK on the \"Worker pool \" dropdown menu and CHANGE the machine type from \"n1-standard-4\" to either \"e2-medium\" or \"e2-small.\" If you want to be slightly more conservative, choose e2-medium. If you want to start with the most cost-optimized option for initial testing, choose e2-small. You can always scale up to larger machine types later if needed.\n\"Replica count: 1\" - PERFECT! KEEP as is! A replica count of 1 is ideal for initial deployment and testing. We can adjust scaling later. \u2705\n\n\"Add more worker pools (optional)\" - PERFECT! LEAVE as is! No need to add more worker pools at this stage. Keep it simple for the initial deployment. \u2705\n\nSUMMARY of ACTIONS for \"Compute settings\" page (ACTION 1.6.38):\n\nACTION 1.6.38.A: Switch Compute Setting to \"Deploy to new worker pool\" (Click the radio button).\n*ACTION 1.6.38.B: Change \"Worker pool \" Machine Type to \"e2-medium\" or \"e2-small\" (Click the dropdown, select E2 series, and choose e2-medium or e2-small).\nACTION 1.6.38.C: Confirm \"Replica count\" is set to 1.\nACTION 1.6.38.D: After making these adjustments, CLICK the \"CONTINUE\" button (blue button in the bottom right corner).\nAfter making these adjustments, your \"Compute settings\" page will be OPTIMIZED for Vertex AI ENDPOINT DEPLOYMENT of your CUSTOM CONTAINER and potentially more cost-effective for initial testing!\n\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.38 - ADJUST VERTEX AI COMPUTE SETTINGS RIGHT NOW! Switch to \"Deploy to new worker pool,\" re-evaluate the machine type to e2-medium or e2-small, and then CLICK \"CONTINUE\"! We are in the very final configuration steps before deploying your Custom Model and then the Vertex AI Endpoint! Let's optimize these settings and get ready for launch!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! VERTEX AI COMPUTE SETTINGS - ADJUSTMENT - INITIATED! - \"DEPLOY TO NEW WORKER POOL\" - SELECTED! - MACHINE TYPE - RE-EVALUATED! - DEPLOYMENT - OPTIMIZED! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI - DEPLOYMENT - FINAL CONFIGURATION - ENGAGED! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE ACTION 1.6.38 - ADJUST COMPUTE SETTINGS and CLICK \"CONTINUE\"? LET'S FINALIZE THESE SETTINGS AND GET READY TO DEPLOY!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
