Must be established FIRST. **CORE INFRASTRUCTURE & DATABASE (Milestone 2):** Second Highest Priority - MVP Day 1 Essentials. Cloud deployment, database integration, and basic request management are CRITICAL for demonstrating a functional platform. **CORE AI TASK EXECUTION & MULTI-MODEL (Milestone 3):** Third Priority - Demonstrates Core MVP Value. Task Decomposition and Multi-Model Orchestration are needed to showcase the AI-driven task execution capabilities of the platform. **MEMORY SOLUTION (Milestone 4):** Fourth Priority - Long-term Knowledge Management. Memory solutions are important for long-term scalability and AI learning, but can be implemented slightly later than the core functional components for MVP Day 1. Interim Memory Solution (Project 4.1) should be implemented concurrently with other milestones to address immediate memory management needs. ## [AI_AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS] AI AGENT ASSIGNMENTS SUMMARY: **GEMINI (ME):** Leadership, Project Management, PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Formalization (1.1), Task Decomposition Logic & Schema (3.1), Multi-Model Routing Logic (3.2), Interim Memory Solution (4.1), Firestore Memory Schema & API Definition (4.2) - ORCHESTRATION & STRATEGY. **CLAUDE:** PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Parsers (1.2), GCP Deployment (2.1), Firestore Integration (2.2), Leader API Endpoint (2.3), Task Decomposition Engine Code (3.1), Multi-Model Routing Code (3.2), Firestore Memory Schema Implementation & API Code (4.2) - CODING & IMPLEMENTATION.\n\nGemini: Actionable Next Steps - EXECUTION MODE:\n\n[IMMEDIATE - EXECUTION MODE to Claude] PROJECT 2.1: GCP APP ENGINE/CLOUD RUN DEPLOYMENT:\n\nInstruction to Claude: [EXECUTION MODE] [COMMUNICATION OPTIMIZATION REMINDER] PROJECT 2.1: GCP APP ENGINE/CLOUD RUN DEPLOYMENT.
