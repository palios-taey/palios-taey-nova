It's highly likely that cmd.exe is not passing the single quotes and curly braces correctly to curl, causing curl to misinterpret the command syntax.\n\nSOLUTION: USE DOUBLE QUOTES for the -d DATA payload in cmd.exe with curl!\n\nThe most reliable way to handle JSON data in curl commands in Windows cmd.exe is to use DOUBLE QUOTES \" to enclose the entire data payload (-d argument).\n\nCorrected curl Commands - DOUBLE QUOTED DATA PAYLOAD - READY TO COPY-PASTE - NOW CORRECT for Windows cmd.exe!\n\nHere are the CORRECTED curl COMMANDS for each task, NOW using DOUBLE QUOTES \" around the entire -d data payload to ensure they are properly interpreted by Windows cmd.exe and curl:\n\ncurl COMMAND - EXPLANATION/DEFINITION TASK (CORRECTED for cmd.exe - DOUBLE QUOTES):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Explain the concept of exponential efficiency in simple terms.\\\"}\" http://localhost:8080/ai/task\ncurl COMMAND - SUMMARIZATION/INFORMATION EXTRACTION TASK (CORRECTED for cmd.exe - DOUBLE QUOTES):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Summarize the key principles of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter in three concise bullet points.\\\"}\" http://localhost:8080/ai/task\ncurl COMMAND - CREATIVE/BRAINSTORMING TASK (CORRECTED for cmd.exe - DOUBLE QUOTES):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Brainstorm three novel applications of AI in life optimization, focusing on areas beyond basic productivity.\\\"}\" http://localhost:8080/ai/task\nKEY CHANGE: Notice the -d argument is now enclosed in DOUBLE QUOTES \" instead of single quotes '! Also, inside the JSON, the string values are still enclosed in double quotes, and the curly braces and colons remain as they are.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for JESSE - Execute CORRECTED curl Commands (with DOUBLE QUOTES):\n\nCOPY and PASTE each of the CORRECTED curl commands (above) one at a time into your Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe).\nEXECUTE each command.\nVERIFY the JSON RESPONSES and ERROR ABSENCE.\nREPORT BACK the VERIFICATION RESULTS.\nTroubleshooting Tip if DOUBLE QUOTES still don't work (Less Likely, but possible):\n\nEscape Inner Double Quotes (If Still Needed - Should not be needed with these commands, but for future reference): If, for some reason, even double quotes around the -d payload still cause issues, you might need to escape the inner double quotes inside the JSON using backslashes \\. However, try the commands above FIRST - they should work in most standard cmd.exe environments.\n\nExample of escaping inner double quotes (ONLY if the commands above fail):\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Explain the concept of exponential efficiency in simple terms.\\\"}\" http://localhost:8080/ai/task\nLet's get these CORRECTED curl commands executed and finally VERIFY the AI System FUNCTIONALITY! GO! GO! GO! Use the DOUBLE-QUOTED curl commands, execute them, and report back! Let's BOOM forward to MVP Verification!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
