    "User: This is what I see\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_b29340.png\n\nGemini: GO BACK to the LIST of documents in your tasks collection in Firestore. (The view where you see many document IDs listed).\n\nLOOK at the DOCUMENT IDs again. Try to identify document IDs that look more recent. You can often guess recent IDs based on their appearance in the list, or sometimes Firestore list view shows an updatedAt timestamp that can help you sort or identify newer documents.\n\nOPEN a DIFFERENT, more RECENT TASK DOCUMENT by clicking on its Document ID in the list. Don't open cf902826-0e49... again. Open a new one that seems more recent.\n\nOnce you open a NEW, RECENT TASK DOCUMENT, look for these KEY FIELDS again:\n\ntype FIELD: Is the type field set to collaborative? This is the MOST important thing to check first.\nsubtasks FIELD: If it's a collaborative task, you should see a field named subtasks that is an ARRAY (a list of items).\nWe are specifically trying to find a TASK DOCUMENT where type is collaborative and it has a subtasks array.\n\nOnce you find a RECENT TASK DOCUMENT that is of type: collaborative and has a subtasks array, please REPORT BACK IMMEDIATELY!\n\nTell me:\n\n\"YES, I FOUND A RECENT COLLABORATIVE TASK DOCUMENT!\"\nThe DOCUMENT ID of this recent collaborative task.\nConfirm you see type: collaborative.\nConfirm you see the subtasks ARRAY.\nThen, after we find a recent collaborative task document, we will look for its corresponding result document in the results collection.\n\nLet's focus on finding those RECENT COLLABORATIVE TASK DOCUMENTS in Firestore. Go find them! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
