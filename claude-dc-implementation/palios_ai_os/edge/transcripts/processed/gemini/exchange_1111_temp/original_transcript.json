[remote rejected] main -> main (pre-receive hook declined) error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system.git'\n\nGemini: Please run these commands in your C:\\ai-execution-system directory:\n\nList files at the root of your main branch:\n\ngit ls-tree --name-only HEAD\nThis command will list the files and directories at the root of the latest commit in your main branch.\n\nIs .gitignore listed in the output of this command?\n\nShow the content of your .gitignore file (if it exists in the output above):\n\nIf .gitignore is listed in the output of the previous command, run this to display its content:\n\ngit show main:.gitignore\nDoes the output of this command show that your .gitignore file contains the line .terraform or similar to ignore the .terraform directory?\n\nNext, let's deeply examine your Git history to see if any references to the large files still exist after running git filter-repo. We'll use Git commands combined with findstr (on Windows) to search the history.\n\nPlease run these commands in your C:\\ai-execution-system directory and carefully examine their output:\n\nSearch commit history objects for the large file names (part 1 - for 6.23.0 version):\n\ngit rev-list --objects --all | findstr \"terraform-provider-google_v6.23.0_x5.exe\"\nThis command searches through all commits and objects in your Git history and tries to find any object IDs associated with the filename terraform-provider-google_v6.23.0_x5.exe.\n\nDoes this command produce any output? If it does, please copy and paste the output here. No output is good news \u2013 it would mean no objects with this filename are found.\n\nSearch commit history objects for the large file names (part 2 - for 6.20.0 version):\n\ngit rev-list --objects --all | findstr \"terraform-provider-google_v6.20.0_x5.exe\"\nThis is the same search, but for the other large file version terraform-provider-google_v6.20.0_x5.exe.\n\nDoes this command produce any output? If it does, please copy and paste the output here. Again, no output is good.\n\nSearch Git history for any references to the .terraform directory path:\n\ngit ls-tree -r main | findstr \"deployment/terraform/.terraform\"\nThis command lists the content of your main branch recursively and searches for any lines containing the path deployment/terraform/.terraform.\n\nDoes this command produce any output? If it does, please copy and paste the output here. No output is good; it would mean no references to the .terraform directory are found in the current main branch.\n\nPlease run all five of these commands and provide me with the output of each, especially if any of them produce output (which would indicate the large files or directory are still being referenced in your Git history).\n\nThis detailed examination of your repository will give us a clearer picture of whether git filter-repo actually removed the files from history as expected or if they are still lurking somewhere. Let's investigate!"
