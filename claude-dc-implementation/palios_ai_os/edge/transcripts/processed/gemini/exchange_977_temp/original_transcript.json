Double-check that deploy.sh actually contains script code and is not just a blank file. If it's empty, that's the immediate problem - we need the actual script content.\nIf it has content, please confirm it looks like a shell script. It should start with #!/bin/bash on the first line and contain shell commands.\nIf the file is NOT empty and looks like a script, proceed to the next steps.\nRun deploy.sh with bash -x (DEBUG MODE):\n\nIn Git Bash, run the script with the -x option added to bash:\n\nbash -x deploy.sh\n-x option for bash (Shell Tracing/Debugging): The -x option tells bash to print each command to the terminal before executing it. This is a very powerful debugging tool for shell scripts. It will show us exactly what commands bash is attempting to run in the script, step-by-step.\n\nExamine the output from bash -x deploy.sh VERY CAREFULLY.\n\nDo you see any output at all now?\nDo you see lines starting with +? These lines (with +) are the commands being traced by bash -x.\nDoes the output stop at some point? If so, note the last command that was printed with + before the output stops.\nAre there any ERROR messages in the -x output? Even if the script is exiting silently, -x might reveal error messages that are not being displayed normally.\nCheck File Permissions in Git Bash:\n\nIn Git Bash, navigate to your Terraform directory: cd /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform\nRun:ls -l deploy.sh\nExamine the permissions column (e.g., -rwxr-xr-x, -rw-r--r--). While bash deploy.sh should execute the script even without execute permissions, let's ensure it has execute permissions just to rule out any permission-related issues, especially in Git Bash. If the permissions are like -rw-r--r-- (no x for execute), try making it executable:\nchmod +x deploy.sh\nThen try running ./deploy.sh (with ./) and bash deploy.sh again.\nVerify Correct Terraform Directory:\n\nDouble-check that you are definitely in the correct Terraform directory in Git Bash when running bash deploy.sh. The directory should contain the deploy.sh script and your Terraform configuration files (main.tf, providers.tf, etc.). Use pwd command in Git Bash to print the current working directory to confirm.\nSimple Test Script (If Still No Output after -x):\n\nLet's create a very simple test shell script to see if Git Bash is generally working and executing scripts in your environment.\n\nCreate a new file named test_script.sh in the same Terraform directory.\n\nOpen test_script.sh in a text editor and paste in these lines:\n\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"DEBUG: Test script START\"\necho \"Hello from test_script.sh!\"\necho \"DEBUG: Test script END\"\nSave test_script.sh.\n\nIn Git Bash, run: bash test_script.sh\n\nExamine the output. Do you see the \"DEBUG: Test script START\", \"Hello...\", and \"DEBUG: Test script END\" messages?\n\nIf test_script.sh WORKS and produces output, then Git Bash is working correctly, and the issue is likely specific to the deploy.sh script itself (its content or logic).\nIf test_script.sh also produces NO OUTPUT, then there might be a more fundamental issue with your Git Bash environment or how you are executing scripts in Git Bash.\nAction Plan - Follow these steps in order:\n\nVerify deploy.sh file content (Step 1 above). Report if it is empty or looks incorrect.\nRun bash -x deploy.sh in Git Bash (Step 2 above). Report the entire output you see (even if it's still no output, explicitly say \"bash -x deploy.sh produced NO output\").\nIf still no output from -x, check file permissions in Git Bash (Step 3).\nVerify correct Terraform directory in Git Bash (Step 4).\nCreate and run test_script.sh (Step 5). Report if test_script.sh works or also produces no output.\nBy systematically going through these steps, we should be able to isolate the reason why deploy.sh is not running and producing output. Let's get to the root cause! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
