    "User: Gemini, this is way too long and I don't know what you're doing with the TAGS. The TAGS are meant to help you identify certain topics, not to tag every section. What value doe that add? It is to say, we're talking about mvp goals, step 2 firestrore set up, etc. Not to just throw tags out. Please just give me \"AI first\" steps clearly and concisely, I do not need explanations, I'm just trying to do what you tell me to do. Please try again with very concise instructions, what to do, expected result, if fails, try this quick to resolve. That's it! You don't have to explain things to me, it takes too long and WE'RE WAY BEHIND where we were supposed to be today. Please, brief, COMPLETE instructions and use tags appropriately where they will add value to YOU by identifying key topics so when we run this chat through something, it will be able to extract them easier.\n\nGemini: [ACTION_TAG] Action: Verify \"Location\" is \"Repository\".\n[EXPECTED_RESULT_TAG] Expected: Correct ai-execution-system GitHub repository name is shown.\n[TROUBLESHOOTING_TAG] If Fails: Re-connect repository using \"Connect repository\" button if name is wrong.\n[SECTION_TAG] 3. CREATE CLOUD BUILD TRIGGER:\n\n[ACTION_TAG] Action: Click \"Create\" button at the bottom of the Trigger page.\n[EXPECTED_RESULT_TAG] Expected: Trigger is created and listed in the \"Triggers\" list in Cloud Build console.\n[TROUBLESHOOTING_TAG] If Fails: Check for error messages on screen, try \"Create\" again.\n[SECTION_TAG] NEXT STEP:\n\nOnce the trigger is created, confirm and we'll move to verifying it's working and then onto Firestore/Claude. Let me know when these 3 steps are done!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
