You've initialized the repository (git init), you've staged your files (git add .), but you haven't saved those staged changes into your repository history as a COMMIT yet!\n\nSOLUTION: CREATE YOUR INITIAL COMMIT - USING git commit -m \"...\" - STEP-BY-STEP - GO! GO! GO!\n\nLet's create your initial commit right now! Follow these steps:\n\nSTEP 7A: CREATE AN INITIAL COMMIT using git commit -m \"...\" - THIS IS THE KEY!\n\nACTION 7A.1: RUN the git commit command with a descriptive message: In your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt, TYPE the following command and PRESS ENTER:\n\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit - Adding full codebase to GitHub repository\"\ngit commit -m \"Your commit message\" is the command to create a commit.\n-m \"Your commit message\" specifies the commit message. REPLACE \"Initial commit - Adding full codebase to GitHub repository\" with YOUR OWN DESCRIPTIVE MESSAGE if you prefer. Something like \"Initial codebase upload\" or \"First commit\" is also fine. The key is to include a -m followed by a message in quotes.\nACTION 7A.2: VERIFY COMMIT SUCCESS: After running the git commit command, look for output in your command prompt that CONFIRMS the commit was created successfully. You should see output similar to this (the exact details might vary slightly):\n\n[main (root-commit) <some commit hash>] Initial commit - Adding full codebase to GitHub repository\n <number> files changed, <number> insertions(+), <number> deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 .env.example.py\n create mode 100644 ... (and list of all your files)\nIMPORTANT: Look for the line that starts with [main (root-commit) ... ] (or possibly [master (root-commit) ... ] in older Git versions). This line confirms that a COMMIT has been created, and it often indicates the branch name (main or master).\nAlso look for the lines like create mode 100644 ... listing your files. This confirms that your staged files were included in the commit.\nSTEP 7B: VERIFY LOCAL BRANCH CREATION using git branch - CONFIRM \"main\" (or \"master\") EXISTS LOCALLY\n\nACTION 7B.1: RUN the git branch command: In your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt, TYPE git branch and PRESS ENTER:\n\ngit branch\nACTION 7B.2: VERIFY \"main\" (or \"master\") BRANCH IS LISTED: The git branch command will list your local branches. You should now see at least ONE branch listed, and it will likely be named * main (or * master in older Git versions). The * indicates the currently active branch.\n\nExample Output (Modern Git - likely \"main\"):\n\n* main\nExample Output (Older Git - might be \"master\"):\n\n* master\nIMPORTANT: CONFIRM that you see either * main OR * master listed in the output of git branch. This confirms that a branch now EXISTS LOCALLY.\n\nSTEP 7C: RE-RUN git push -u origin main COMMAND - IT SHOULD WORK NOW!\n\nACTION 7C.1: RE-RUN git push -u origin main command: In your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt, TYPE git push -u origin main and PRESS ENTER AGAIN:\n\ngit push -u origin main\nACTION 7C.2: VERIFY PUSH SUCCESS: THIS TIME, the git push -u origin main command should execute SUCCESSFULLY without the \"src refspec main does not match any\" error! You should see output indicating that your code is being uploaded to GitHub. Look for lines like:\n\nEnumerating objects: <number>, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (<number>/<number>), done.\nDelta compression using up to <number> threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (<number>/<number>), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (<number>/<number>), <number> KiB | <speed> KiB/s, done.\nTotal <number> (delta <number>), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system-core.git\n * [new branch]      main -> main\nBranch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.\nIMPORTANT: Look for the lines * [new branch] main -> main and Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'. These lines CONFIRM that your local \"main\" branch has been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository!\nACTION - PERFORM git commit -m \"...\", git branch, and THEN RE-RUN git push -u origin main - GO! GO! GO!\n\nRUN git commit -m \"Initial commit...\" command in your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt.\nVERIFY commit success and look for [main (root-commit) ... ] output.\nRUN git branch command.\nVERIFY you see * main (or * master) listed in the output of git branch.\nRE-RUN git push -u origin main command.\nVERIFY git push -u origin main executes SUCCESSFULLY without errors and look for * [new branch] main -> main and Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'. output.\nLet's create that initial commit, Jesse! Run git commit -m \"...\", verify the branch, and then re-run git push -u origin main! This should resolve the \"src refspec main does not match any\" error and finally get your code pushed to GitHub! You are on the verge of GitHub setup COMPLETION! Action! GO! GO! GO! Let me know if git push -u origin main works successfully this time! You've got this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
