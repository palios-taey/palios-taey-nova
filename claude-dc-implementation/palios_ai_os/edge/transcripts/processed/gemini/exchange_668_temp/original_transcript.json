    "User: What's next? GOQ\n\nGemini: Be deployed and is healthy (Health Check OK).\nReceive HTTP POST requests.\nParse JSON request bodies.\nExtract the task_description.\nEcho back the task_description in the response.\nNOW, LET'S REPLACE THE \"ECHO\" LOGIC with ACTUAL AI PROCESSING!\n\nOur IMMEDIATE NEXT GOAL is to make the execute_task function:\n\nReceive a task_description (just like before).\nUSE the task_description as a PROMPT for a LANGUAGE MODEL.\nGet the LANGUAGE MODEL'S RESPONSE.\nReturn the LANGUAGE MODEL'S RESPONSE in the JSON output instead of just echoing back the task description.\nFor this MVP step, we will START with a VERY SIMPLE LANGUAGE MODEL INTEGRATION. We'll use a basic text generation model and a straightforward prompting strategy. We can get more sophisticated later.\n\nHERE'S THE PLAN - MVP STEP: \"BASIC TEXT GENERATION TASK\":\n\nChoose a Language Model API: For this initial MVP, let's use Google Cloud's Vertex AI PaLM 2 model (or a similar readily available model on Vertex AI) as it's already within the Google Cloud ecosystem and likely easier to integrate with our Cloud Function. (We can explore OpenAI or other models later if needed).\n\nImport Vertex AI Python Library: We will need to add the necessary import statement to our main.py to use the Vertex AI Python client library. (We've already added google-cloud-aiplatform to requirements.txt in previous steps, so we should be good on dependencies).\n\nModify execute_task(request) function in main.py:\n\nInitialize Vertex AI client within the execute_task function (if needed - we might be able to initialize it outside the function for efficiency, we'll check).\n\nReplace the \"echo\" logic with code to call the Vertex AI PaLM 2 model.\n\nUse the task_description as the PROMPT for the language model's generate_text() method (or equivalent).\n\nExtract the TEXT RESPONSE from the language model's output.\n\nConstruct a JSON response that includes the LANGUAGE MODEL'S TEXT RESPONSE instead of the echoed task_description. Something like:\n\n{\n  \"task_description\": \"[original task description]\",\n  \"ai_response\": \"[language model generated text response]\",\n  \"status\": \"task_executed_with_ai\"\n}\nUpdate main.py with these changes.\n\nRE-DEPLOY the Cloud Function using the same gcloud functions deploy command with --entry-point execute_task (we'll keep using execute_task as the entry point for now).\n\nTEST the updated execute_task function using curl again, sending the same TASK DESCRIPTION in the JSON body.\n\nVERIFY that the TERMINAL OUTPUT from curl now shows the LANGUAGE MODEL'S RESPONSE in the JSON output, instead of just the echoed task description.\n\nTHIS NEXT MVP STEP, \"BASIC TEXT GENERATION TASK\", WILL BE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! WE WILL HAVE A CLOUD FUNCTION THAT ACTUALLY PERFORMS AI PROCESSING BASED ON A TASK DESCRIPTION!\n\nARE YOU READY TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES IN main.py and TRANSFORM OUR \"ECHO TASK\" INTO A \"BASIC TEXT GENERATION TASK\"?\n\nIF YES, LET'S START MODIFYING main.py AGAIN! CONFIRM \"READY TO MODIFY main.py FOR AI TASK\" and LET'S GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT! WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING AMAZING!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
