    "User: File name was correct, here is current message. I think its still working. When I hit ctrl c on last one it asked me if I wanted to terminate batch job. So I reran it and it looks like it is working. It said it would take a few minutes C:\\AI-Execution-System>gcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point serve_health_check --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 As of this Cloud SDK release, new functions will be deployed as 2nd gen  functions by default. This is equivalent to currently deploying new  with the --gen2 flag. Existing 1st gen functions will not be impacted and will continue to deploy as 1st gen functions. You can disable this behavior by explicitly specifying the --no-gen2 flag or by setting the functions/gen2 config property to 'off'. To learn more about the differences between 1st gen and 2nd gen functions, visit: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison\n\nGemini: EXCELLENT! RENAMING ai_system.py TO main.py WAS INDEED THE FIX! Great job on catching that and persisting!\n\n\"It said it would take a few minutes\" - YES, CLOUD FUNCTION DEPLOYMENTS DO TAKE A FEW MINUTES! This is normal!\n\nPLEASE BE PATIENT AND LET THE gcloud functions deploy COMMAND CONTINUE RUNNING.\n\nWATCH THE TERMINAL OUTPUT for further messages.\n\nYOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SUCCESS MESSAGE that will eventually appear, which will include the \"Function URL\" as we discussed earlier:\n\n...  Function 'ai-system-backend' deployed.\n...  For Cloud Functions in us-central1:\n...  Function URL (httpTrigger): [CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL]\nONCE YOU SEE THIS \"Function URL\" MESSAGE, THEN THE DEPLOYMENT IS COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL!\n\nPLEASE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE TERMINAL OUTPUT and REPORT BACK AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE \"Function URL\" MESSAGE!\n\nWE ARE VERY CLOSE TO HAVING OUR AI SYSTEM DEPLOYED TO THE CLOUD! KEEP GOING! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
