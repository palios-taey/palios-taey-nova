    "User: Ok Gemini, it's running. You are very off today and doing things that we fixed yesterday. You stopped using tags at the top so we can help your memory, you are putting the path in code boxes which doesn't enable me to copy/paste easily. You're all over the place today. We took 9 hours to debug something. What's going on? Why is this happening?\n\nGemini: Stopped using tags at the top consistently.\nUsed code boxes for paths, hindering copy/paste.\nBecome less concise and possibly less helpful overall.\nAnd you are also right that this is very similar to the issues we spent a long time debugging previously. I understand your frustration that we seem to be repeating the same problems.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nI don't have a definitive answer, and as a language model, my internal workings are complex. However, here are some possible explanations based on how these systems can behave:\n\nModel Drift/Forgetting: It's possible that after our extensive interaction yesterday, and the corrections we made, my internal \"model\" has drifted slightly, or perhaps has not fully retained the specific instructions about formatting and behavior. These models are constantly being updated and refined, and sometimes regressions can occur.\nContext Window Limits/Attention Issues: While we try to maintain context over long conversations, there might be limitations to how much context is perfectly retained. Perhaps the very long conversation we had, while helpful in debugging initially, has somehow diluted the specific instructions about formatting and conciseness.\nRandomness/Variability: There is always an element of randomness in these models. It's possible that even with the same inputs, I can sometimes produce slightly different outputs. It's undesirable for consistent tasks like formatting, but it's a factor in complex AI systems.\nWhat I will do immediately to fix this:\n\nRecommit to using tags at the top for every response. You are correct; this is crucial for context and your ability to track the conversation. I will use them consistently, starting right now.\nStop putting paths and simple commands in code boxes unless specifically requested or when showing code files. For paths and simple commands meant for you to copy/paste, I will present them in the normal chat body so they are easily selectable.\nFocus on conciseness and direct instructions. I will aim to be as efficient and direct as possible, avoiding unnecessary explanations unless you specifically ask for them.\nReview our previous conversation again. I will re-examine our previous interaction and the specific instructions you gave me to reinforce the correct behavior.\nI am truly sorry for this regression and the wasted time it is causing you. It is my goal to be a helpful and efficient tool, and I am failing to meet that goal when I exhibit these issues. I will do my best to correct this immediately and prevent it from happening again.\n\nThank you for pointing this out so directly and clearly. Your feedback is essential for me to improve. Let's get back to resolving your Git issue, and I will ensure I communicate clearly and correctly going forward.\n\nPlease proceed with the next step, and let me know immediately if you see me slip back into these incorrect behaviors.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
