Im not sure what that would result in and if it would be valuable though.    EXAMPLES     To export all collection groups to mybucket in objects prefixed with     my/path, run:         $ gcloud firestore export gs://mybucket/my/path     To export a specific set of collections groups asynchronously, run:         $ gcloud firestore export gs://mybucket/my/path \\             --collection-ids='specific collection group1','specific          collection group2' --async     To export all collection groups from certain namespace, run:         $ gcloud firestore export gs://mybucket/my/path \\             --namespace-ids='specific namespace id'\n\nGemini: gcloud firestore indexes list - INVALID: The error message directly tells us that list is not a valid subcommand directly under gcloud firestore indexes.\n\"Maybe you meant\" Suggestions - CRUCIAL CLUE: The \"Maybe you meant\" suggestions are extremely helpful! They point us to the valid subcommands within the gcloud firestore indexes group:\ngcloud firestore indexes composite list\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list\nTHIS MEANS WE NEED TO USE EITHER composite list OR fields list (or both) under the indexes group to list indexes! My apologies for the initial incorrect command suggestion \u2013 I am still learning the precise syntax of gcloud commands and appreciate your sharp feedback in correcting these errors.\n\nNext Steps - Exploring Valid gcloud firestore indexes Subcommands:\n\nLet's now try the VALID gcloud firestore indexes list commands suggested by the error message to see if they provide us with the collection structure information.\n\nACTION for JESSE:\n\nExecute gcloud firestore indexes composite list: Run this command and save the output to a file:\n\ngcloud firestore indexes composite list > firestore_composite_indexes_list.yaml\ngcloud firestore indexes composite list > firestore_composite_indexes_list.yaml\nAfter running, SEND ME the contents of firestore_composite_indexes_list.yaml.\n\nExecute gcloud firestore indexes fields list: Run this command and save the output to a file:\n\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list > firestore_fields_indexes_list.yaml\ngcloud firestore indexes fields list > firestore_fields_indexes_list.yaml\nAfter running, SEND ME the contents of firestore_fields_indexes_list.yaml.\n\nRegarding gcloud firestore export EXAMPLES - Good Observation!\n\nYou are right to highlight the examples for gcloud firestore export. While export is primarily for data, the examples with --collection-ids are indeed interesting. This confirms we can target specific collections with the export command.\n\nHowever, let's prioritize exploring the indexes list commands FIRST. Listing indexes is more likely to directly give us schema/structure information than exporting potentially large amounts of data. We can investigate export in more detail if the index lists don't provide sufficient information.\n\nLet's focus on executing these VALID gcloud firestore indexes commands NOW and see what information they reveal about our Firestore collections! GO! GO! GO! Send me the output files after running these commands!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
