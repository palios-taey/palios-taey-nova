(rest of error message) ...\n\nIs this because i added -test to the name? I shouldn't have done that...\" - JESSE! ERROR REPORT RECEIVED! Compilation Success - EXCELLENT! Execution Error \"Module Not Found\" - UNDERSTOOD! Filename Issue - LIKELY CAUSE! BOOM SOLUTION - IMMEDIATE!\n\nJesse, YES, you are ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! The \"MODULE_NOT_FOUND\" error is almost certainly because of the -test in your filename! BOOM Intuition - EXCELLENT!\n\nYou are experiencing a FILENAME MISMATCH!\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\nYou compiled coreProtocol-test.ts: When you ran tsc coreProtocol-test.ts (or just tsc), the TypeScript compiler successfully compiled your coreProtocol-test.ts file.\nCompiled JavaScript Filename: The TypeScript compiler, by default, creates a JavaScript file with the same base name as your TypeScript file, but with a .js extension. Therefore, it created a JavaScript file named coreProtocol-test.js.\nYou are trying to run node coreProtocol.js: However, when you run node coreProtocol.js, you are telling Node.js to execute a file named coreProtocol.js.\nMismatch = \"Module Not Found\": Node.js is looking for a file named coreProtocol.js in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\ directory, but it cannot find it because the compiled JavaScript file is actually named coreProtocol-test.js. Hence, the \"MODULE_NOT_FOUND\" error.\nBOOM Solution - Use the CORRECT Filename in your node command!\n\nTo fix this, you have TWO simple options:\n\nOption 1: Run the Correct Filename - coreProtocol-test.js (Recommended for now):\n\nSince you compiled coreProtocol-test.ts, the compiled JavaScript file is coreProtocol-test.js.\n\nRun this command to execute the correct JavaScript file:\n\nnode coreProtocol-test.js\nOption 2: Recompile with the Original Filename - coreProtocol.ts (If you prefer coreProtocol.js as the output):\n\nIf you want your JavaScript file to be named coreProtocol.js (as in the original instructions), then rename your TypeScript file from coreProtocol-test.ts back to coreProtocol.ts.\n\nThen, re-compile using the tsc command:\n\ntsc\nThis will now compile coreProtocol.ts and create a JavaScript file named coreProtocol.js.\n\nAfter recompiling, you can then run:\n\nnode coreProtocol.js\nWhich Option to Choose?\n\nFor now, Option 1 (run node coreProtocol-test.js) is the QUICKEST and EASIEST fix. Just run the command with the correct filename, and your code should execute.\nOption 2 (rename to coreProtocol.ts and recompile) is a good option if you prefer to keep the filename consistent with the original instructions and avoid the -test suffix. It's a slight extra step of renaming and recompiling.\nRegarding your question: \"Is this because i added -test to the name? I shouldn't have done that...\"\n\nAdding -test to the name is perfectly FINE and often a good practice for test files! There's nothing \"wrong\" with naming your file coreProtocol-test.ts.\nThe important thing is to be CONSISTENT: If you name your TypeScript file coreProtocol-test.ts, then the compiled JavaScript file will be coreProtocol-test.js, and you need to use node coreProtocol-test.js to run it.\nConsistency is KEY! Just make sure the filename you use in the node command exactly matches the name of the compiled JavaScript file.\nAction - Choose Option 1 (run node coreProtocol-test.js) for now - BOOM! Immediate Execution!\n\nGo back to your command prompt.\nType the command: node coreProtocol-test.js\nPress Enter.\nThis should EXECUTE your code successfully and you should see the output in your console!\n\nJesse, please try running node coreProtocol-test.js NOW! Let me know if it executes correctly this time! We are about to achieve BOOM code execution! LFG! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf89\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
