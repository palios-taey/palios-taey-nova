    "User: Ok, can you walk me through the format of the sensitive.auto.tfvars file? It isn't in the documentation. Also, do I need to change anything in the deploy.sh file? Like the section where it says (leave empty to skip)?\n\nGemini: The format for sensitive.auto.tfvars to define your API keys is as follows:\n\nopenai_api_key = \"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_VALUE\"\ngemini_api_key = \"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_VALUE\"\nExplanation:\n\nopenai_api_key = ... and gemini_api_key = ...: These lines define Terraform variables named openai_api_key and gemini_api_key. These variable names are likely expected by the Terraform configuration files (like main.tf) to provide the API key values.\n\"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_VALUE\" and \"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_VALUE\": REPLACE THESE PLACEHOLDERS with your actual API key values. Make sure to enclose the API key values in double quotes \"...\". API keys are strings, so they need to be quoted.\nExample sensitive.auto.tfvars file (with example placeholder keys - REPLACE THESE):\n\nopenai_api_key = \"sk-your-openai-api-key-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\ngemini_api_key = \"AIzaSyB-your-gemini-api-key-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\"\nImportant Notes about sensitive.auto.tfvars Format:\n\nFile Extension: The file must be named exactly sensitive.auto.tfvars. Terraform automatically loads files with the .auto.tfvars extension in the current directory.\nHCL Syntax: Use correct HCL syntax. Variable names are on the left of the = sign, and values (in quotes) are on the right.\nOne Key per Line: Put each API key definition on a separate line.\nNo Extra Characters: Do not add any extra characters, comments (unless using HCL comment syntax like # comment), or formatting that is not valid HCL within this file. Keep it clean and simple.\nCase Sensitivity: Variable names in Terraform are case-sensitive. Make sure you use the correct case (likely lowercase as in the example: openai_api_key, gemini_api_key).\n2. Do you need to change anything in the deploy.sh file?\n\nNo, you do NOT need to change anything in the deploy.sh file itself to configure API keys using sensitive.auto.tfvars, based on the snippet of the deploy.sh file you provided.\n\nExplanation of the deploy.sh Script Snippet:\n\n# --- Configure API keys (optional) ---\nprint_step \"Configuring API keys...\"\nread -p \"Enter OpenAI API Key (leave empty to skip): \" OPENAI_API_KEY\nread -p \"Enter Gemini API Key (leave empty to skip): \" GEMINI_API_KEY\n\nif [ ! -z \"$OPENAI_API_KEY\" ] || [ ! -z \"$GEMINI_API_KEY\" ]; then\n  # Create a temporary tfvars file for sensitive values\n  cat > sensitive.auto.tfvars << EOL\nopenai_api_key = \"${OPENAI_API_KEY}\"\ngemini_api_key = \"${GEMINI_API_KEY}\"\nEOL\n  print_info \"API keys configured in sensitive.auto.tfvars (this file is gitignored)\"\nfi\nread -p \"Enter OpenAI API Key (leave empty to skip): \" OPENAI_API_KEY and read -p \"Enter Gemini API Key (leave empty to skip): \" GEMINI_API_KEY: These lines are BASH commands that prompt you to enter your OpenAI and Gemini API keys when you run the deploy.sh script. The \"(leave empty to skip)\" part is part of the prompt message, indicating that entering keys is optional. The entered values are stored in the BASH variables OPENAI_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY.\nif [ ! -z \"$OPENAI_API_KEY\" ] || [ ! -z \"$GEMINI_API_KEY\" ]; then ... fi: This is a BASH conditional statement. It checks if either the OPENAI_API_KEY OR GEMINI_API_KEY variables are not empty (! -z). If at least one of them is not empty (meaning you entered at least one API key when prompted), then the code inside the if block is executed.\ncat > sensitive.auto.tfvars << EOL ... EOL: If the if condition is true (you entered at least one key), this section creates or overwrites the sensitive.auto.tfvars file in the current directory. It uses cat to write the text between EOL and EOL into the sensitive.auto.tfvars file.\nopenai_api_key = \"${OPENAI_API_KEY}\" and gemini_api_key = \"${GEMINI_API_KEY}\": Inside the cat block, these lines write the values you entered at the prompts (stored in the BASH variables) into the sensitive.auto.tfvars file in the correct HCL format, as explained in section 1 above.\nprint_info \"API keys configured in sensitive.auto.tfvars (this file is gitignored)\": This line just prints an informative message to the console confirming that the API keys have been configured in sensitive.auto.tfvars and reminding you that the file is .gitignored.\n\"Leave empty to skip\" meaning:\n\nIf you run deploy.sh and press ENTER without typing anything when prompted for the OpenAI or Gemini API key, the corresponding BASH variable (OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY) will be empty. The if condition will still be true if you entered a key for the other API. If you leave both prompts empty, the if condition will be false, and sensitive.auto.tfvars will NOT be created or modified, effectively skipping the API key configuration step.\n\nAction Plan:\n\nCreate sensitive.auto.tfvars File: In your terraform directory, create a new text file named exactly sensitive.auto.tfvars.\nEdit sensitive.auto.tfvars: Open sensitive.auto.tfvars in a text editor and paste in the format shown in section 1 above, replacing the placeholders with your actual OpenAI and Gemini API key values, making sure they are enclosed in double quotes.\nRun deploy.sh: Open your command prompt, navigate to your terraform directory, and run ./deploy.sh. When prompted for API keys, you can just press ENTER to skip because you have already configured them in sensitive.auto.tfvars. The script should detect the sensitive.auto.tfvars file and use the keys from there (based on standard Terraform behavior with .auto.tfvars files - double-check the script or Terraform configuration to be absolutely sure, but this is the very common and expected behavior).\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure your API keys for the MVP deployment using sensitive.auto.tfvars and run deploy.sh to deploy to GCP. Remember to prioritize implementing GCP Secret Manager for proper security in the next phase.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or encounter any issues!
