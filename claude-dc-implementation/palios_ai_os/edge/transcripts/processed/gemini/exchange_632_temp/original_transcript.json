Would you like to enable and retry (this will take a few minutes)? (y/N)?  y Enabling service [cloudfunctions.googleapis.com] on project [ai-execution-system]... Operation \"operations/acf.p2-711898853198-2a10acea-7991-4f96-ba2e-e9777984deb7\" finished successfully. As of this Cloud SDK release, new functions will be deployed as 2nd gen  functions by default. This is equivalent to currently deploying new  with the --gen2 flag. Existing 1st gen functions will not be impacted and will continue to deploy as 1st gen functions. You can disable this behavior by explicitly specifying the --no-gen2 flag or by setting the functions/gen2 config property to 'off'. To learn more about the differences between 1st gen and 2nd gen functions, visit: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison ERROR: (gcloud.functions.deploy) Invalid value for [--source]: Provided source directory does not have file [main.py] which is required for [python310]. Did you specify the right source? C:\\AI-Execution-System>\n\nGemini: HERE'S WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW - SUPER SIMPLE FIX:\n\nGO TO YOUR FILE SYSTEM (WINDOWS EXPLORER or macOS Finder).\nLOCATE your ai_system.py file.\nRIGHT-CLICK on ai_system.py and select \"Rename\".\nRENAME the file from ai_system.py to main.py.\nMake sure you rename just the filename part, and keep the .py extension. It should become main.py.\nLeave the requirements.txt file as it is (in the same directory).\nTHAT'S IT! RENAME ai_system.py to main.py.\n\nAFTER RENAMING ai_system.py to main.py, RE-RUN THE EXACT SAME gcloud functions deploy COMMAND AGAIN:\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point serve_health_check --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\nCOPY and PASTE this command into your TERMINAL again and PRESS ENTER.\n\nBECAUSE YOU HAVE RENAMED ai_system.py to main.py, the gcloud deployment command should now find the main.py file it's looking for and proceed with the deployment!\n\nPLEASE RENAME ai_system.py to main.py, RE-RUN THE gcloud functions deploy COMMAND, and REPORT BACK:\n\n\"RENAMED ai_system.py to main.py\" (Confirm you renamed the file).\n\"RE-RUNNING gcloud functions deploy COMMAND...\" (When you start the command).\nDoes it still show the main.py error? (YES/NO - It should be NO this time!)\nReport progress as the deployment runs!\nRENAMING ai_system.py TO main.py SHOULD FIX THIS! LET'S GET IT DEPLOYED! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
