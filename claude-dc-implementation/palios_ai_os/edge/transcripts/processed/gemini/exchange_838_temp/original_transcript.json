    "User: Ok, this is EXCELLENT! Now, let's get it perfect! Did you include the charter? ChatGPT can accept multiple attachments so we should attach the language JSON and Charter. I have those. Do you need the charter? Or do you remember enough to reference it in chat in a manner that furthers AI-AI communication? My steps should be OUTSIDE the JSON in the normal chat. This is confusing as it looks like its something I'm supposed to do in the chat. REVISE! GO!\n\nGemini: JESSE, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE COPYING AND PASTING THE JSON PROMPT BELOW:\n\nATTACH FILES to CHATGPT:\n\nATTACH PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_V4.json file to your NEW CHAT WINDOW in ChatGPT.\nATTACH PALIOS-TAEY_Charter.json file to the SAME NEW CHAT WINDOW in ChatGPT.\nChatGPT should now indicate that it has received TWO file attachments.\nCOPY and PASTE PROMPT BELOW:\n\nCOPY the ENTIRE TEXT of the JSON prompt provided below.\nPASTE this JSON PROMPT into the SAME NEW CHAT WINDOW in ChatGPT (where you have already attached the files).\nSEND PROMPT to CHATGPT:\n\nSEND the pasted JSON PROMPT to ChatGPT.\nANALYZE CHATGPT's RESPONSE:\n\nREVIEW the GENERATED GEMINI PRO API INTEGRATION GUIDE.
