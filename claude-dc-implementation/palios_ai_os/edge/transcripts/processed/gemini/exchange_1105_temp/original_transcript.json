C:\\Users\\jesse>where git 'where' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. C:\\Users\\jesse>\n\nGemini: git-filter-repo, as its name suggests, is a tool that depends on Git. It needs the core git command to function. That's why you are getting the \"File Not Found\" error from git-filter-repo \u2013 it's trying to run the git command, and the system can't find it because Git is not properly installed or in your PATH.\n\nThe IMMEDIATE SOLUTION is to INSTALL Git for Windows!\n\nPlease follow these steps to install Git for Windows:\n\nDownload Git for Windows:\n\nOpen your web browser and go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win\nThe download for Git for Windows should start automatically. If not, click the \"Click here to download manually\" link. Download the appropriate installer for your system (usually the 64-bit Git for Windows Setup).\nRun the Git for Windows Installer:\n\nRun the downloaded .exe installer file.\n\nIMPORTANT: During the installation process, pay close attention to the \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" step. You will see a screen with options like \"Use Git from Git Bash only\", \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software\", and \"Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt\".\n\nChoose the option: \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software\" (Recommended). This is crucial. This option ensures that Git commands will be available in your regular Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), which is what git-filter-repo needs.\n\nYou can generally accept the default options for the rest of the installation, unless you have specific preferences. Click \"Next\" through the installer, making sure to select \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software\" at the \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" step.\n\nComplete the installation.\n\nAfter Installation, Open a NEW Command Prompt:\n\nClose your current command prompt window.\nOpen a new command prompt window (Windows key -> cmd -> Enter).\nVerify Git Installation:\n\nIn the new command prompt, run these commands again to verify Git is now working:\n\ngit --version\nwhere git\nTell me the output of both git --version and where git after installing Git for Windows and opening a new command prompt.\n\ngit --version should now show the Git version. (e.g., git version 2.43.0.windows.1)\nwhere git should now show the path to git.exe. (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe)\nOnce git --version and where git are working correctly and show Git information, then we will FINALLY be able to run git filter-repo and complete the process of removing the large files and pushing to GitHub!\n\nPlease proceed with installing Git for Windows, carefully selecting the \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software\" option during installation. Then, verify Git using git --version and where git in a new command prompt. Let me know the results! We are at the very last step now!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
