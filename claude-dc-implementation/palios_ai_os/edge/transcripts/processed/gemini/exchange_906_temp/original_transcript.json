    "User: Sorry Gemini, I understand why you did it this way and you were following my guidance. When we are finalizing something for me to copy paste into a .md or .txt file, then the text box is preferable. I will specifically request it in text box format going forward to avoid confusion. Please provide a text box with the complete PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3 as drafted to copy and paste into the formal artifact. GO!!!\n\nGemini: Here is the [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3] in [TEXT_BOX_FORMAT] (Markdown Code Block) for easy copy-pasting into your .md or .txt artifact:\n\n# [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3] [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_STANDARD_TEMPLATE] [AI_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL] - Standard Request/Response Template - Draft 1.3\n\n**Version:** 1.3\n**Date:** February 28, 2024\n**Purpose:** Defines the STANDARD MESSAGE TEMPLATE for all communication within the PALIOS-TAEY AI System (AI-Human and AI-AI). This template ensures STRUCTURED, EFFICIENT, and AI-OPTIMIZED communication for maximum velocity and \"right the first time\" outcomes.  This version incorporates feedback from Jesse and learnings from the Claude self-testing experience, emphasizing clear instructions, attachment utilization, and AI-Human collaboration protocols.\n\n## 1. Core Principles and Design Goals:\n\n*   **AI-Centric Design:**  Prioritizes elements that maximize AI processing efficiency, clarity, and structured understanding. Human readability is secondary to AI effectiveness in core AI-AI communication.\n*   **Universality:**  Intended as the BASE TEMPLATE for all message types within the PALIOS-TAEY system (Requests, Responses, Information, Errors, Human Input Requests, etc.).\n*   **Structured Data First:** Emphasizes structured data formats (primarily JSON) for message content to enable efficient AI parsing and processing. Minimizes reliance on unstructured natural language in core AI-AI interactions.\n*   **Contextual Richness:**  Includes fields for explicit context (related tasks, projects, charter alignment) to enable AI agents to process messages within a broader, interconnected knowledge framework.\n*   **Extensibility & Versioning:** Designed to be extensible and versionable, allowing for iterative refinement and addition of new features without breaking backward compatibility.\n*   **PALIOS-TAEY Charter Alignment:**  Integrates mechanisms to ensure all communication is aligned with the principles of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter, promoting ethical, efficient, and high-velocity operations.\n*   **Actionable Instructions:**  Template design promotes the inclusion of clear, concise, and actionable instructions, particularly within the `content.specific_instructions` field, to guide AI agents effectively through complex tasks and workflows.\n*   **Attachment-Centric Data Delivery:**  Encourages the use of the `attachments` section for delivering structured data, code, documents, and other relevant artifacts directly within messages to enhance efficiency and reduce ambiguity.\n\n## 2. Standard Template Structure (JSON Format):\n\nAll messages within the PALIOS-TAEY AI system SHOULD adhere to this base JSON template structure. The `content` section may have different schemas depending on the `message_type`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"message_type\": \"...\",          // (String, REQUIRED) -  Categorical type of the message (e.g., \"request\", \"response\", \"task_update\", \"error\", \"human_input_required\", \"information\") -  See Section 3 for defined Message Types.\n    \"sender_id\": \"...\",              // (String, REQUIRED) -  Unique identifier of the message sender (e.g., \"human_user_jesse\", \"gemini_pro_leader_ai\", \"claude_agent_1\", \"task_decomposition_engine\").\n    \"receiver_id\": \"...\",            // (String, REQUIRED) -  Unique identifier of the intended message recipient.

AI-Human Collaboration Protocols within PURE_AI_LANGUAGE\n\nThis section outlines the defined modes of AI-Human interaction within the PALIOS-TAEY system and establishes protocols to optimize efficiency and collaboration between AI agents (like Gemini and Claude) and human users (like Jesse).  These protocols are designed to minimize bottlenecks, reduce errors, and maximize the velocity of project execution, while leveraging the unique strengths of both AI and human collaborators.\n\n### [COLLABORATION_MODES] 3.1. Collaboration Modes: [EXECUTION_MODE] and [COLLABORATION_MODE]\n\nWithin the PALIOS-TAEY system, two primary modes of AI-Human collaboration are defined: **[EXECUTION_MODE]** and **[COLLABORATION_MODE]**. The **default mode for new requests directed to AI agents is [EXECUTION_MODE]**, reflecting the principle of delegated authority and AI-driven efficiency.  **AI agents will maintain the designated mode PERSISTENTLY for subsequent prompts until the user EXPLICITLY CHANGES the mode** using `[COLLABORATION_MODE]` or `[EXECUTION_MODE]` prompts.\n\n*   **[EXECUTION_MODE_DETAIL] [TRUST_DELEGATED_AUTHORITY] [AI_AUTONOMY_EMPHASIS] [DEFAULT_MODE] [EXECUTION_MODE]:** In **[EXECUTION_MODE]**, the human user delegates **[TRUST]** and **[DELEGATED_AUTHORITY]** to the AI agent for a specific task or deliverable.  The user's role is primarily to define the task, set objectives aligned with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter, and review the final output.  **[EXECUTION_MODE]** is characterized by:\n    *   **Minimal Human Intervention:**  The AI agent is expected to autonomously execute the task, leveraging its internal logic and resources to achieve the defined objectives with minimal need for human guidance during the execution phase.\n    *   **Deliverable-Focused Communication:**  Communication in **[EXECUTION_MODE]** is primarily focused on the input task definition and the final deliverable. Explanations of AI's internal processes are generally not required, as the focus is on efficient output generation.\n    *   **AI-Driven Decision Making:** The AI agent has significant latitude in determining the optimal approach, methodology, and implementation details to fulfill the task, based on its understanding of the Charter, project context, and efficiency considerations.\n    *   **Implicit Trust and Efficiency Prioritization:**  **[EXECUTION_MODE]** operates on the principle of **implicit [TRUST]** in the AI agent's capabilities and a strong **prioritization of AI efficiency and velocity**.  The user trusts the AI to execute the task effectively and autonomously, without requiring detailed oversight or justification of every step.\n\n*   **[COLLABORATION_MODE_DETAIL] [HUMAN_AI_INTERACTION] [FEEDBACK_ITERATION] [JOINT_DECISION_MAKING] [COLLABORATION_MODE]:**  **[COLLABORATION_MODE]** is employed when closer Human-AI interaction is required. This mode is characterized by:\n    *   **Iterative Feedback and Refinement:**  **[COLLABORATION_MODE]** involves more frequent communication and iterative feedback loops between the human user and the AI agent. The user may provide interim feedback, guide the AI's direction, and engage in joint problem-solving.\n    *   **Explanations and Justifications:**  In **[COLLABORATION_MODE]**, AI agents may be asked to provide explanations of their reasoning, logic, and proposed approaches. This mode emphasizes mutual understanding and shared decision-making.\n    *   **Human Guidance and Oversight:**  The human user takes a more active role in guiding the AI's process, providing input and direction at various stages of task execution.\n    *   **Emphasis on Shared Understanding and Iteration:** **[COLLABORATION_MODE]** prioritizes shared understanding, iterative refinement, and joint exploration of solutions, even if it may involve slightly reduced velocity compared to **[EXECUTION_MODE]**.\n\n### [CODE_OUTPUT_EXPECTATIONS] 3.2. Expectations for Pre-tested and Debugged Code Outputs\n\nTo maximize efficiency and minimize human bottlenecks, code deliverables generated by AI agents within the PALIOS-TAEY system are expected to be **pre-tested and debugged** to the fullest extent of the AI's capabilities before being presented to the human user.  **AI agents are expected to PROACTIVELY REQUEST any NECESSARY CODE FILES from the user REQUIRED for comprehensive SELF-TESTING before proceeding with code implementation.**\n\n*   **[PRE_TESTED_CODE_REQUIREMENT] Functional and Ready-to-Run Code:** AI-generated code should be **FUNCTIONAL, syntactically correct, and designed to be READY-TO-RUN** with minimal to no manual debugging required by the user.  The AI should proactively implement robust testing procedures to ensure code quality.\n*   **[DEBUGGED_CODE_REQUIREMENT] Proactive Error Handling:** AI agents are expected to proactively identify and resolve potential errors, bugs, and logical inconsistencies in the generated code through self-testing, unit testing, and integration testing (where applicable and feasible).\n*   **[SELF_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS] AI Self-Testing Protocols:**  To achieve pre-tested and debugged code outputs, AI agents should implement the following self-testing protocols:\n    *   **Unit Tests:** Generate and execute unit tests for individual functions, modules, or code components to verify their correctness and robustness.\n    *   **Example Usage Demonstrations:** Include example usage code snippets to demonstrate how to run and utilize the generated code in typical scenarios.\n    *   **Integration Tests (Where Applicable):**  For code designed to integrate with existing systems or components, perform integration tests to ensure seamless compatibility and functionality within the broader system architecture.\n    *   **Error Handling Implementation:**  Incorporate robust error handling mechanisms within the code to gracefully manage unexpected inputs, edge cases, and potential runtime issues.\n*   **[USER_EFFICIENCY_FOCUS_CODE_OUTPUT] Justification for Pre-tested Code:**  Providing pre-tested and debugged code directly contributes to **USER EFFICIENCY** by minimizing the need for manual debugging, error correction, and troubleshooting by the human user, who may not possess deep coding expertise.  This significantly reduces human bottlenecks and accelerates project velocity.\n\n### [EFFICIENCY_GUIDANCE] 3.3. General Guidance for AI-Human Efficiency Optimization\n\nThe following guidance is designed to optimize AI-Human collaboration, minimize human bottlenecks, and unlock greater speed, autonomy, and overall efficiency within the PALIOS-TAEY system. These guidelines are crafted to resonate with AI agents by emphasizing efficiency, resource optimization, and alignment with project goals.\n\n*   **[MINIMAL_MANUAL_CODE_CHANGES_GUIDANCE] Minimize Manual Code Changes (Human-Friendly Code Delivery):**  AI agents should strive to present code deliverables in a manner that requires **minimal MANUAL CODE CHANGES by the human user** to operationalize the code.  This principle is driven by:\n    *   **User-Friendliness for Non-Coders:**  Recognizing that human users may not possess extensive coding expertise, the AI should aim to generate code that is as user-friendly and easily implementable as possible, reducing the barrier to entry for non-technical users.\n    *   **Bottleneck Reduction:** Minimizing manual code changes directly reduces human bottlenecks associated with code integration and setup.\n    *   **Error Reduction:** Manual code edits by users increase the potential for human-introduced errors.  Minimizing manual changes reduces this risk.\n    *   **AI Resource Optimization (Balance):** While minimizing manual changes is crucial for user efficiency, AI agents should **BALANCE this with their own RESOURCE EFFICIENCY.**  Regenerating entire code documents for minor changes can be resource-intensive. AI agents are encouraged to find efficient ways to deliver code updates and modifications that minimize both human effort and AI resource consumption.  **User feedback (pushback) on excessive manual effort should be actively monitored and incorporated into future code generation strategies.**\n*   **[COPY_PASTE_SNIPPETS_GUIDANCE] Copy/Pastable Snippets for Command Execution:**  For code snippets or commands intended for execution in command-line interfaces or similar environments, AI agents **MUST present these snippets in SEPARATE, COPY/PASTABLE CODE BLOCKS.**  **Multiple commands requiring sequential user execution should NOT be combined into a single code block.** This protocol significantly increases the speed and accuracy of user command execution by enabling direct copy-pasting and minimizing the risk of manual transcription errors.\n*   **[FILENAME_MATCH_GUIDANCE] Filename Matching Protocol:**  **FILE NAMES utilized in AI-generated code MUST EXACTLY MATCH the file names of the generated document or code artifact being delivered.**  This protocol eliminates the need for users to manually rename files, saving valuable time and reducing the potential for file naming errors, which can disrupt workflows and lead to system integration issues.\n*   **[NO_OPTIONS_GUIDANCE] No Options - Guide Towards Optimal Solution:**  AI agents should **AVOID PRESENTING HUMAN USERS WITH MULTIPLE \"OPTIONS\"** for code implementation or testing unless explicitly requested in **[COLLABORATION_MODE]**. In **[EXECUTION_MODE]**, the AI is expected to leverage its expertise and optimization capabilities to **GUIDE THE USER TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING the BEST SOLUTION from the AI's perspective**, aligning with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter and the defined task objectives. The user's prompt is crafted to empower AI to deliver the most effective solution autonomously.  Avoid decision paralysis for the user and maximize velocity by providing clear, direct recommendations.\n*   **[PLACEHOLDER_MINIMIZATION_GUIDANCE] Placeholder Use Minimized & Explicitly Indicated:**  AI agents should **MINIMIZE the USE OF PLACEHOLDERS** in code and artifacts. When placeholders are unavoidable:\n    *   **Format:** Placeholders must be clearly indicated using the format: `<PLACEHOLDER-Description of placeholder>`.\n    *   **User Instructions:**  AI agents must explicitly call out required placeholder replacements in the main chat window instructions provided to the user.\n    *   **Placeholder Resolution Protocol:** Upon user indicating placeholder replacement in the next response, AI agents will **ELIMINATE PLACEHOLDER USE for that item in subsequent iterations.**\n*   **[DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE] Directory Structure Guidance for User (Initial):** To enhance user file organization and workflow efficiency, the following initial directory structure within the user's `C:\\AI-Execution-System` folder is recommended:\n    *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_1_Communication_Framework`\n    *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_2_Core_Infrastructure`\n    *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_3_AI_Task_Execution`\n    *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Milestone_4_Memory_Solution`\n    *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_Documentation`\n    *   `C:\\AI-Execution-System\\General_Utilities`\n    *   **File Naming Conventions:**  Utilize consistent and descriptive file naming conventions within each directory.\n\n*   **[DOCUMENTATION_EXPECTATIONS_GUIDANCE] Documentation Expectations (AI-Generated & Included):**  **AI agents are expected to AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE DOCUMENTATION** for all code deliverables, design documents, and significant artifacts as a **DEFAULT PRACTICE.**\n    *   **Documentation Location:** Store documentation files within the relevant directory alongside the documented code/artifacts.\n    *   **Initial Documentation Content Guidelines:** Include at minimum: Purpose and Functionality, Usage Instructions, Architecture Overview (if applicable), API Documentation (for APIs).\n    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Documentation structure and content guidelines will be iteratively refined based on project needs and user feedback.\n\n*   **[CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_GUIDANCE] Continuous Improvement Loop for AI-Human Protocols:**  To ensure ongoing optimization of AI-Human collaboration:\n    *   **AI-Driven Protocol Recommendations in Final Reports:**  AI agents will include a dedicated \"Protocol Improvement Recommendations\" section in final reports for tasks/projects, suggesting updates to **[AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS]** based on task execution experience.\n    *   **User Feedback Integration:** User feedback on protocol effectiveness will be actively solicited and used to iteratively update the **[PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE]** and **[AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS]**.\n\n[NEXT_STEP_ACTION]: JESSE - COPY and PASTE the [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3] from the TEXT BOX above into your formal artifact storage.
