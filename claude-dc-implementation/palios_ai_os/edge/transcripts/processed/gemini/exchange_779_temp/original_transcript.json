    "User: I couldn't find it the way you suggested. Can I fix in Options window?\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_0bde1d.png\n\nGemini: The \"Path\" setting you are seeing in the \"Options\" window is PROBABLY for that SPECIFIC APPLICATION to find the git.exe executable. Many applications that work with Git need to know where Git is installed on your system so they can use Git internally. This \"Path\" setting is for that application's internal use of Git.\n\nThe 'git' is not recognized... error in your COMMAND PROMPT means that WINDOWS ITSELF (your operating system) cannot find the git.exe program when you type git in the command prompt. This is a problem with your SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, specifically the SYSTEM PATH variable.\n\nTHESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT \"PATHS\" - APPLICATION PATH vs. SYSTEM PATH - and they serve DIFFERENT PURPOSES!\n\nTo fix the 'git' is not recognized... error in your command prompt, you need to modify the SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE PATH, as described in STEP 3B of the instructions.\n\nThe \"Path\" setting in the \"Options\" window of that application is LIKELY not going to fix the command prompt error. Setting the \"Path\" in that application's options might only tell that application where to find Git, but it won't make git command available in your general command prompt.\n\nLET'S GET BACK to MODIFYING the SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE PATH - THIS IS THE CORRECT SOLUTION for the COMMAND PROMPT ERROR! - GO! GO! GO!\n\nPlease go back to STEP 3B of the instructions and follow those steps CAREFULLY to modify the SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE PATH. This is the correct way to make git recognized system-wide in your command prompt.\n\nRE-ITERATING STEP 3B - MODIFYING SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE PATH (for Command Prompt Git Recognition):\n\nACTION 3B.1 (RE-ITERATED): OPEN System Environment Variables:\nPress the Windows key and type: environment variables\nSelect \"Edit the system environment variables\" from the search results. (System Properties -> Advanced Tab -> Environment Variables button)\nACTION 3B.2 (RE-ITERATED): FIND the \"Path\" System Variable:\nIn the \"Environment Variables\" window, in the \"System variables\" section (bottom section), SCROLL DOWN and FIND the variable named \"Path\" (or \"PATH\").\nSELECT \"Path\" and click the \"Edit...\" button.\nACTION 3B.3 (RE-ITERATED): ADD New Entry with Git Directory:\nIn the \"Edit environment variable\" window, click the \"New\" button.\nPASTE or TYPE the FULL PATH to your Git bin directory (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin).\nClick \"OK\" in all open windows.\nAFTER modifying the SYSTEM PATH VARIABLE, REMEMBER to CLOSE and REOPEN your Command Prompt and then try git --version again!\n\nPLEASE FOCUS on MODIFYING the SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE PATH as described in STEP 3B - THIS IS THE KEY to fixing the command prompt error! The \"Path\" setting in the application \"Options\" window is likely for a different purpose and won't solve this particular problem.\n\nGo back to STEP 3B, follow the SYSTEM PATH instructions, and then try git --version in a new command prompt again. Let me know if you still get the error after modifying the SYSTEM PATH! We will get this Git issue resolved! ACTION! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
