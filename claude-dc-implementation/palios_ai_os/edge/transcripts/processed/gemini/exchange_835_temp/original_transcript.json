This is a CRITICAL area for expansion to explicitly guide AI-AI communication within the system, especially given our focus on AI-AI synergy and task decomposition. We need to provide initial AI-AI communication guidelines based on the existing human-centric principles.\n\"CLARITY_DIRECTION\" Principle - FURTHER EMPHASIZE SINGLE PATH & AI LEADERSHIP: While \"CLARITY_DIRECTION\" is strong, we can further emphasize the need for the AI to act as a definitive leader providing a single, optimal path to the human, minimizing ambiguity and decision overload for the human partner. Strengthen the \"AI_ROLE: LEADER_DIRECTIVE\" aspect.\n\"ACTION_ORIENTATION\" Principle - EXPLICITLY LINK to OUTSOURCING & DELEGATION: In the context of outsourcing execution tasks, we can strengthen the \"ACTION_ORIENTATION\" principle by explicitly linking it to the strategy of delegating execution tasks to humans, freeing up AI for higher-level strategic and creative work.\n\"ITERATIVE_VELOCITY\" Principle - ADD METRICS & MEASUREMENT for VELOCITY: To make \"ITERATIVE_VELOCITY\" more actionable and measurable, consider adding a brief mention of tracking key velocity metrics (e.g., tasks completed per sprint, time to implement a feature) to quantify and optimize for speed.\nAI-HUMAN vs. AI-AI Communication Nuances - INITIAL DIFFERENTIATION: While the core principles are broadly applicable, we can begin to subtly differentiate between AI-HUMAN and AI-AI communication styles within the \"PURE_AI_TRANSLATION\" subsections. For example, while \"POSITIVE_REINFORCEMENT\" is crucial for humans, it might be less relevant (or require a different interpretation) for AI-AI communication.
