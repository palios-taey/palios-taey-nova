Let's re-examine our understanding of how Google Cloud Functions routes HTTP requests when you have multiple functions in the same file.\n\nRE-EVALUATING CLOUD FUNCTION ROUTING:\n\nSingle HTTP Trigger, Single Entry Point: We have deployed a single Cloud Function (ai-system-backend) with a single HTTP trigger and a single declared entry point (serve_health_check in the initial deployment, and still serve_health_check in the recent re-deploy, because we haven't changed the --entry-point in the gcloud command).\n\nFunction Entry Point and HTTP Methods: Google Cloud Functions HTTP triggers, in their simplest form (like ours currently), are often designed to have a single entry point function that handles all incoming HTTP requests to the function's base URL. It is then the responsibility of the function code itself to differentiate between different types of requests (e.g., based on HTTP method, path, headers, body) and execute different logic accordingly.\n\nOur main.py Structure: In our main.py, we now have two functions: serve_health_check and execute_task. Both are designed to be HTTP Cloud Function entry points. However, we are currently only telling Google Cloud Functions that serve_health_check is the declared entry point using the --entry-point serve_health_check in the gcloud deploy command.\n\nHYPOTHESIS: IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE ONLY DECLARING serve_health_check AS THE ENTRY POINT, AND THEREFORE, ALL INCOMING HTTP REQUESTS (GET or POST) ARE BEING ROUTED TO serve_health_check, REGARDLESS OF HTTP METHOD OR REQUEST BODY?\n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, then even when we send a POST request with the curl command, Google Cloud Functions is still invoking the serve_health_check function because that's the only function we've told it to use as an entry point!\n\nTo test the execute_task function, we might need to explicitly tell Google Cloud Functions to use execute_task as the entry point for TASK EXECUTION requests.\n\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS (Let's try SOLUTION #1 first):\n\nSOLUTION #1: CHANGE THE --entry-point in gcloud deploy to execute_task\n\nLet's try the simplest approach first. Let's change the --entry-point in our gcloud functions deploy command to execute_task and re-deploy. This would tell Google Cloud Functions: \"Now, the main entry point for this Cloud Function is execute_task.\"\n\nUPDATED gcloud functions deploy COMMAND (SOLUTION #1):\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point execute_task --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\nCHANGE in this command:\n\n--entry-point execute_task: We have changed the --entry-point value from serve_health_check to execute_task. This should tell Google Cloud Functions to use the execute_task function as the entry point for HTTP requests to ai-system-backend.\nACTION PLAN for SOLUTION #1:\n\nEXECUTE this UPDATED gcloud functions deploy command with --entry-point execute_task in your terminal.\n\nWAIT for deployment to complete and get the FUNCTION URL again.\n\nRE-TEST the ECHO TASK using the SAME curl command as before (the corrected one with double quotes and escaped inner quotes) :\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Research the key technological advancements in AI in the last 5 years and summarize their potential impact on society.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend\nOBSERVE the TERMINAL OUTPUT from the curl command.\n\nIf SOLUTION #1 works, then changing the --entry-point to execute_task will make the Cloud Function invoke execute_task when we send the POST request.\n\nIF SOLUTION #1 DOES NOT WORK (we still get the health check response or an error), then we will need to explore other solutions (like using different FUNCTION NAMES or different FUNCTION URLs for health check and task execution - SOLUTION #2, which we will discuss if SOLUTION #1 fails).\n\nLET'S TRY SOLUTION #1 FIRST: RE-DEPLOY with --entry-point execute_task and TEST the ECHO TASK again with curl! GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
