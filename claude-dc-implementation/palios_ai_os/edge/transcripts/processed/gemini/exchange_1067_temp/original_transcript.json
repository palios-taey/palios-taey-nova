    "User: C:\\ai-execution-system\\deployment\\terraform>git push origin main error: src refspec main does not match any error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system-core.git' C:\\ai-execution-system\\deployment\\terraform>\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_b35142.png\n\nGemini: [SECTION_TAG] 1. CHECK GIT REPOSITORY ROOT:\n\nAction: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root of your ai-execution-system folder (the folder containing app.py, cloudbuild.yaml, etc., not the terraform subfolder).\nAction: Run command: git status\nExpected Result: git status should show you are in a Git repository. If it says \"Not a git repository\", you are in the wrong folder.\nTroubleshooting: Make sure you are in the ai-execution-system root folder, not ai-execution-system\\deployment\\terraform. The git push needs to be executed from the repository root.\n[SECTION_TAG] 2. CHECK CURRENT BRANCH & REMOTE TRACKING:\n\nAction: Run command: git branch -v\nExpected Result: This shows your local branches. You should see * main (or similar indicating you are on the main branch). It should also show if main is tracking a remote branch. It might look like: * main [origin/main] Your last commit message... The [origin/main] part indicates it's tracking the remote main branch.\nTroubleshooting (If not tracking):\nIf you are on main but it's not tracking origin/main, try: git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\nThen try git push origin main again.\n[SECTION_TAG] 3. CHECK FOR LOCAL COMMITS:\n\nAction: Run command: git log\nExpected Result: git log should show your recent commits, including the \"Test Cloud Build Trigger - Updated print in app.py\" commit. If it shows \"fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet\", there are no commits to push on the current branch.\nTroubleshooting (No commits): If no commits, ensure you did git add app.py and git commit -m \"...\" before trying to push. If you did commit, double-check you are on the correct branch (git branch).\n[SECTION_TAG] 4. VERIFY REMOTE URL (Less Likely, but check):\n\nAction: Run command: git remote -v\nExpected Result: This lists your configured remotes. You should see origin pointing to your GitHub repository URL ( https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system.git).\nTroubleshooting (Incorrect URL): If the URL is wrong, you can update it: git remote set-url origin <your_correct_github_repo_url>\n[CONCISE_ACTIONS_TAG] Concise Actions - Push Fix:\n\ncd C:\\ai-execution-system (Go to repo root)\ngit status (Verify in Git repo)\ngit branch -v (Check branch & tracking)\ngit log (Check for commits)\nIf needed: git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\ngit push origin main (Try push again from repo root)\nLet me know:\n\nAre you running git push from C:\\ai-execution-system?\nWhat does git status, git branch -v, and git log show?\nAfter trying these checks, does git push origin main work from the ai-execution-system root folder?\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
