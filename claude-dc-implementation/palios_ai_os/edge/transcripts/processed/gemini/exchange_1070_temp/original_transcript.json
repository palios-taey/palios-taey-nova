    "User: Ok, just tell me what to do. Concise steps, Tags at the top, response in normal chat body. GO!\n\nGemini: 2.  **Merge `temp-orphan` into `main` with the allow unrelated histories flag:**\n    ```text\n    C:\\ai-execution-system>git merge --allow-unrelated-histories temp-orphan\n    ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nYou got the \"refusing to merge unrelated histories\" error because `temp-orphan` (and likely `master`) don't share a common history with your `main` branch.  `master` is even marked as starting a \"fresh history\". You should merge `temp-orphan` into your `main` branch (which seems to be your primary branch) using the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag to force the merge despite the unrelated histories.  After merging, carefully review the changes. Don't merge with `master`.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
