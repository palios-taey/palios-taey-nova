    "User: Ok, everything was COPIED not moved into the /terraform folder in the same structure. Dockerfile is saved. Now, what do I do, just the bash deploy.sh?\n\nGemini: bash deploy.sh\nNow, WATCH THE OUTPUT VERY CAREFULLY!\n\nObserve if the script proceeds further this time.\nCheck if the Docker image build process starts and progresses without the \"Dockerfile not found\" error. You should hopefully see Docker build output in the terminal.\nMonitor for any new ERROR messages that might appear during the Docker build, Terraform plan, or Terraform apply steps.\nLet's see if, with the Dockerfile and application code now in place, we can get past the Docker build errors and potentially move further in the deployment process!\n\nRun bash deploy.sh and tell me EXACTLY what the output is this time! Fingers crossed for progress! LFG! We are pushing forward!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
