    "User: Ok, apparently there is a desktop 'app' that does not install and that's what I used. I am going through proper install now and there will likely be an option for PATH. What about this setting? It has notepad as well, just not sure what to pick.\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_0bd67c.png\n\nGemini: During the Git installer, you will likely encounter a step titled \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" or something similar. THIS IS THE KEY STEP for fixing the 'git' is not recognized... error!\n\nMAKE SURE to choose the option that says \"Recommended: Add Git to PATH environment variable.\" It might be worded slightly differently, but look for an option that explicitly mentions \"PATH environment variable\" and \"Recommended.\" This option will automatically handle adding Git to your system's PATH, which is exactly what we need!\n\nRegarding the Editor Choice (Vim vs. Notepad vs. Other):\n\nThe editor choice in the Git installer is LESS CRITICAL for getting Git working in the command prompt right now. This setting determines the default text editor that Git will use for tasks like writing commit messages.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the editor choices and recommendations for this stage (you can always change this later):\n\nVim (the ubiquitous text editor): POWERFUL but NOT beginner-friendly. Vim is a very powerful, highly configurable text editor favored by many developers, but it has a steep learning curve and an unusual interface. For now, I would NOT recommend choosing Vim as your default Git editor if you are not already familiar with it.\n\nNotepad: VERY SIMPLE, but TOO LIMITED for code editing. Notepad is the basic text editor built into Windows. It's extremely simple and lacks many features that are helpful for code editing (syntax highlighting, code formatting, etc.). I would also NOT recommend choosing Notepad as your default Git editor.\n\n\"Let Git Decide\" (or similar option if offered): Some installers might have an option like \"Let Git Decide\" or \"Use Git's default editor.\" This usually defaults to Vim, but it might also use a slightly more user-friendly default in some cases. This option is ACCEPTABLE if you are unsure, but it will likely still default to Vim.\n\nModern GUI Code Editor (If you have one already, and if installer allows): If you ALREADY USE a modern code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, etc., and the Git installer gives you an option to choose a specific editor, you could select your preferred code editor. This would make it slightly more convenient to edit commit messages using an editor you are already familiar with. However, this is NOT ESSENTIAL for getting Git working in the command prompt.\n\nRECOMMENDATION for EDITOR CHOICE - For Now - Prioritize PATH Installation!\n\nFor now, to keep things simple and focused on getting Git working in the command prompt, I recommend the following for the editor choice during Git installation:\n\nPRIORITY: Focus on the \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" step and choose the \"Recommended: Add Git to PATH environment variable\" option. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING to get right during installation to fix the 'git' is not recognized... error!\n\nEDITOR CHOICE - Choose \"Let Git Decide\" (or similar default option) OR a slightly more user-friendly option than Notepad if offered. Don't overthink the editor choice at this stage. You can always change the default Git editor later if needed. Choosing \"Let Git Decide\" or a slightly better default than Notepad will be perfectly fine for now. Avoid choosing Vim or Notepad directly unless you have a strong preference for them already.\n\nACTION - PROCEED with PROPER GIT INSTALLATION - FOCUS on PATH OPTION - GO! GO! GO!\n\nPROCEED with the \"proper\" Git installation from the official Git website.\nCAREFULLY LOOK for the \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" step during the installation process.\nENSURE you select the option to \"Add Git to PATH environment variable\" (or the recommended option that mentions \"PATH\").\nFor the Editor Choice, choose \"Let Git Decide\" or a slightly more user-friendly default than Notepad (if offered). Don't choose Vim or Notepad directly unless you have a specific preference for them.\nAFTER INSTALLATION, open a NEW COMMAND PROMPT window and type git --version to VERIFY that Git is now correctly recognized (you should see the version number).\nIf git --version works successfully, then proceed with STEP 4 of the GitHub Setup Guide (Configure Git Username and Email).\nIf git --version STILL gives the 'git' is not recognized... error, then report back IMMEDIATELY and we will troubleshoot further.\nLet's get Git properly installed and onto your system's PATH, Jesse! This is the key to unlocking the rest of the GitHub setup and moving forward with codebase migration! ACTION! GO! GO! GO! Focus on the PATH option during installation, and let me know if git --version works successfully in the command prompt afterwards! You've got this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
