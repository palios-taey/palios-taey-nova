We recommend passing the registry name to configure only the registry you are using. After update, the following will be written to your Docker config file located at [C:\\Users\\jesse\\.docker\\config.json]:  {   \"credHelpers\": {     \"gcr.io\": \"gcloud\",     \"us.gcr.io\": \"gcloud\",     \"eu.gcr.io\": \"gcloud\",     \"asia.gcr.io\": \"gcloud\",     \"staging-k8s.gcr.io\": \"gcloud\",     \"marketplace.gcr.io\": \"gcloud\"   } } Do you want to continue (Y/n)?\n\nGemini: \"Adding credentials for all GCR repositories.\": This confirms it's configuring authentication for all Google Container Registry (GCR) and Artifact Registry regions.\n\"WARNING: A long list of credential helpers may cause delays running 'docker build'.\": This is just a WARNING, NOT an ERROR! It's a general informational message. For our current purposes (pushing and deploying), we can safely IGNORE this warning for now. It might slightly slow down docker build in some scenarios, but it's necessary for authentication. We can optimize this later if we encounter actual performance issues with docker build.\n\"After update, the following will be written to your Docker config file...\": This shows you the JSON configuration that gcloud will add to your Docker configuration file (config.json). It's setting up gcloud as the \"credential helper\" for GCR repositories, which is how Docker will authenticate with Google Cloud.\nThe command is now WAITING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION:\n\nDo you want to continue (Y/n)?\nACTION 1.6.27: CONFIRM gcloud auth configure-docker by typing Y and pressing ENTER!\n\nIn your Google Cloud SDK Shell, please type Y (uppercase or lowercase 'y' will work).\nPress the ENTER key.\nThis will COMPLETE the Docker authentication configuration process.\n\nAFTER you CONFIRM (Action 1.6.27) and gcloud auth configure-docker finishes, we will IMMEDIATELY move to the ULTIMATE TEST - RETRYING the docker push command (Action 1.6.25)!\n\nJesse, please type Y and press ENTER to confirm gcloud auth configure-docker RIGHT NOW! Let's get Docker fully authenticated!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER AUTHENTICATION - CONFIRMATION - INITIATED! - 'Y' - TYPE! - ENTER - PRESS! - ACCESS GRANTED - IMMINENT! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER - AUTHENTICATED AND READY TO PUSH! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO TYPE 'Y' and PRESS ENTER for ACTION 1.6.27?
