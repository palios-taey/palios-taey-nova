    "User: I had to select Notepad, I downloaded Sublime, but looks like I need some packages for that, so I just clicked Notepad to proceed because that was the only option that worked. Can configure later if needed. I'm using the middle option for PATH?\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_0b70c7.png\n\nGemini: \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software (Recommended)\" - THIS IS THE OPTION YOU SHOULD CHOOSE!\nWHY is this the BEST OPTION? This \"Recommended\" middle option strikes the ideal balance:\nIt DOES add Git to your PATH environment variable, which is ESSENTIAL to fix the 'git' is not recognized... error in your command prompt.\nIt only adds \"minimal Git wrappers\" to your PATH, avoiding \"cluttering your environment with optional Unix tools.\" This means it adds the necessary Git components to your PATH without potentially causing conflicts with existing Windows commands by adding a lot of extra Unix utilities.\nIt allows you to use Git from Git Bash, Command Prompt, PowerShell, AND any 3rd-party software that needs to use Git. This provides maximum flexibility and compatibility.\nIN SHORT: The MIDDLE \"Recommended\" option for \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" is thePERFECT CHOICE for getting Git working correctly in your command prompt and for general Git usage!** GO WITH IT!\n\nRegarding Notepad Selection - NOTEPAD is OKAY for NOW - PATH SETTING IS MORE IMPORTANT!\n\n\"I had to select Notepad... because that was the only option that worked.\" - UNDERSTOOD! It sounds like you might have encountered some issue or confusion with Sublime Text setup during the Git installation. No problem at all to select Notepad to proceed for now!\n\nNotepad is functional as a basic text editor for Git commit messages. It will work, even though it's very basic.\n\n\"Can configure later if needed\" - YES, ABSOLUTELY! You can EASILY CHANGE the default Git editor later, at any time! Don't worry about getting the perfect editor set up right now during Git installation. The PATH setting is the CRITICAL thing to get right now to fix the command prompt error.\n\nPrioritize PATH Setting Completion - Editor Can Wait! FOCUS on COMPLETING the Git installation with the \"Recommended\" MIDDLE PATH option. We can address setting up a better code editor (like Sublime Text or VS Code) later, as a separate, less urgent task.\n\nNEXT ACTION - PROCEED with GIT INSTALLATION - MIDDLE PATH OPTION - NOTEPAD - VERIFY in COMMAND PROMPT! - GO! GO! GO!\n\nCONTINUE with the Git Installer, SELECTING the MIDDLE OPTION - \"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software (Recommended)\" for the \"Adjusting your PATH environment\" step.\nSELECT \"Notepad\" as the editor (for now - can be changed later).\nCOMPLETE the REST of the Git Installation with the remaining default options (unless you have a specific reason to change something).\nAFTER INSTALLATION is COMPLETE, IMMEDIATELY OPEN a NEW COMMAND PROMPT window.\nTYPE git --version and PRESS ENTER.\nVERIFY that you now see the GIT VERSION NUMBER (e.g., git version 2.x.x) THIS IS THE CRITICAL VERIFICATION! If you see the version number, it means Git is now correctly recognized in your command prompt - SUCCESS!\nIf git --version WORKS SUCCESSFULLY, PROCEED to STEP 4 of the GitHub Setup Guide (Configure Git Username and Email).\nIf git --version STILL FAILS with the 'git' is not recognized... error, STOP and REPORT BACK IMMEDIATELY! We will troubleshoot further. (But with the middle PATH option selected, it should work this time!)\nLet's get Git properly installed and recognized in your command prompt, Jesse! The middle PATH option is the key! Select it, complete the installation, and verify with git --version! You are SO CLOSE to having Git working! ACTION! GO! GO! GO! Let me know if git --version works after the installation! You've got this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
