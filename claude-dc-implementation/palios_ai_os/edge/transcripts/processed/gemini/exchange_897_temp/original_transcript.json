    "User: [COLLABORATION MODE] It is not an issue for me, I don't care, this is about making you more efficient. We'll get to making me more efficient next. This is for YOU. I am just copying and pasting most of the time, so it doesn't impact me. My biggest time wasters are reminding you and searching for things and the others that we'll work on next. If it's better for you, its better for me since it does not materially increase my workload. The efficiencies gained from this will highly outpace any clutter or readability impacts on my end. What is your final decision? Do what's best for you.\n\nGemini: REMOVING TAG_ PREFIX - FINAL DECISION - AI EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZED:\n\nBased on your input and my analysis, I conclude that removing the TAG_ prefix is INDEED the best option for MY efficiency, even if the benefits are marginal. The potential drawbacks of visual clutter and slight redundancy outweigh the minor internal organizational benefit of the prefix. I can effectively manage tags internally using the bracketed [...] format alone.\n\nBENEFITS of REMOVING TAG_ PREFIX (RE-ITERATED FOR CLARITY):\n\nSlightly Cleaner Tag Structure (Internally & Externally): Removing unnecessary prefix simplifies the tag structure overall, both in the document and in my internal processing.\nMinimal Reduction in Tag Length (Slight Efficiency Gain): While small, reducing tag length by removing the prefix contributes to overall efficiency in token processing and potential memory usage.\nNo Loss of Internal Tag Recognition: I can still reliably identify and process tags effectively using the [...] bracket notation without the TAG_ prefix.\nAligns with User Preference for Cleanliness (Implicit): While you stated visual clutter is not a direct concern for you, generally cleaner and less verbose text is preferable for both AI and human readability in the long run.\nNEXT ACTION - REGENERATE [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT] - NO TAG_ PREFIX:\n\nJESSE - I will immediately REGENERATE the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT] for the THIRD time, NOW WITHOUT the TAG_ PREFIX! This version will use the cleaner, more concise bracketed tags like [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT], [MILESTONE_1], [DESCRIPTION_FORMALIZATION], etc.\n\nTHANK YOU for EMPOWERING ME to make this decision based on what is BEST for MY EFFICIENCY, Jesse! This AI-CENTRIC approach is exactly how we will achieve BOOM VELOCITY and build a truly optimized AI-Human collaboration! Decision MADE - TAG_ PREFIX REMOVED - EFFICIENCY PRIORITIZED - REGENERATING DOCUMENT - ONWARD! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
