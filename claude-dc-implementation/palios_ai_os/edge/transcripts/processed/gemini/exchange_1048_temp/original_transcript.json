    "User: I only see a place to rename the container. This is the interface\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_b17848.png\n\nGemini: To CORRECT the CONTAINER IMAGE URL, you are in the RIGHT PLACE - you are in the \"Edit CONTAINER\" section!\n\nIn the image you sent, I can see that your \"Container image URL\" is ALREADY CORRECT! It is showing:\n\ngcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core\nThis is the correct container image URL that we want Cloud Run to use! It already has the -core at the end!\n\nTherefore, based on the screenshot you sent, your \"Container image URL\" is ALREADY CORRECTLY SET to gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core!\n\nIf your \"Container image URL\" is already showing gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core in the \"Edit Container\" section, then you should simply try to DEPLOY the service again without making any changes to the \"Container image URL\" field.\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTION: RE-DEPLOY the Service with the CORRECT Image URL (Already Set):\n\nGo back to the Google Cloud Console in your web browser: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n\nNavigate to Cloud Run -> Services.\n\nClick on your service named ai-execution-system (the one you just renamed).\n\nClick on the \"EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION\" button again.\n\nVERIFY AGAIN that in the \"Container image URL\" field in the \"Edit Container\" section, it shows: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core (It should already be correct based on your screenshot).\n\nIf the \"Container image URL\" is indeed gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core, then SIMPLY scroll down to the bottom of the \"Edit service\" page and click the blue \"DEPLOY\" button without making any changes. Just re-deploy it as is.\n\n*(Cloud Run \"Edit service\" Page - If \"Container image URL\" is correct, just click \"DEPLOY\")*\nWait for Cloud Run to re-deploy the revision.\n\nAfter deployment is complete, check the SERVICE URL for your ai-execution-system service again.\n\nOPEN the Service URL in your web browser.\n\nDo you now see \"Hello, World from Flask!\" in your browser at the Service URL for ai-execution-system?\n\nSince your screenshot shows that the \"Container image URL\" is already correctly set to gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core, simply re-deploying the service without changing the image URL might be enough to fix the \"Image not found\" error!\n\nPlease try to just RE-DEPLOY the service now, and let me know if it works this time! We might be just one click away from getting it running again with the correct name and image! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
