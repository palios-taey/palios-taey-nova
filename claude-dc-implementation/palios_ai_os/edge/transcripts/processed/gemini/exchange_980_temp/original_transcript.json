Lines starting with a + character are the commands being traced.\nDiagnostic Information: Even if the script is still failing or exiting silently for some reason, bash -x should show us:\nIf the script is actually starting to execute at all.\nWhich commands are being executed successfully.\nAt which point the script might be failing or stopping.\nAny error messages that might be produced during execution (even if they are not being displayed normally without -x).\nWhat to look for in the bash -x deploy.sh output:\n\nDo you see ANY output at all now? Even if it's just a few lines, any output from -x is progress.\nLook for lines starting with +. These are the commands being executed.\nSee if the script gets to the check_prerequisites function. You should see lines like:\n+ check_prerequisites\n+ print_step 'Checking prerequisites...'\n+ echo -e '\\033[0;32m[STEP]\\033[0m Checking prerequisites...'\nCheck if the prerequisite checks pass or fail. Look for output related to Terraform and gcloud checks within the check_prerequisites function. Are there any error messages printed by print_error?\nIf it gets past prerequisites, see if it proceeds to configure_gcp_project, configure_api_keys, terraform_init, etc. Follow the -x output step-by-step to see how far the script execution progresses.\nLook for any ERROR messages in the -x output. Even if the script seems to exit silently at the end, there might be error messages printed earlier in the -x trace that could give us clues.\nPlease run bash -x deploy.sh and paste the complete output here, no matter how short or long it is. Let's use this detailed debug output to understand exactly what's happening when you run the script. LFG! We are getting closer to diagnosing this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
