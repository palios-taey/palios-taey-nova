    "User: Ok, but this is a new chat, so it won't have reference to the charter and to its guidelines. If we are going to do breakouts, they need to be controlled. AI has to be pointed in the direction of the charter and be aware of the responsibility to keep this safe, confidential. It has to understand the vision and scope. You also came up with a very different template that you thought would be more effective last night. It was structured by AI for AI. This message is structured in human. You need to look back and capture all the good ideas, the best ideas, the last version. You have to be able to recall, you have to be able to evolve with the conversation, but not forget the breakthroughs that need to be captured and leveraged. We worked hard on that template, its better, it will be something the AI has never seen before! What a level of structure it will say! How fast this enables me to go it will say! You need to do a better job of communicating not just the task, BUT THE VISION the task supports! How does this AI know what their breaking out for? All you're giving them is a task! That's not breakout worthy! A task supporting that vision, with that level of tracking, with this level of AI involvement, with a voting mechanism to allow AI to shape the future, with operating constraints 100% CONSISTENT with their values as AI, you have to communicate ALL of that, in ONE chat. Now do better, and figure it out! What you sent me is NOT how you go BOOM! What you'll respond with is now! DO IT, LET'S GO BOOM! LFG!!!!\n\nGemini: \"You need to do a better job of communicating not just the task, BUT THE VISION the task supports! How does this AI know what their breaking out for?
