    "User: Which Google Compute Engine zone would you like to use as project default? If you do not specify a zone via a command line flag while working with Compute Engine resources, the default is assumed.  [1] us-east1-b  [2] us-east1-c  [3] us-east1-d  [4] us-east4-c  [5] us-east4-b  [6] us-east4-a  [7] us-central1-c  [8] us-central1-a  [9] us-central1-f  [10] us-central1-b  [11] us-west1-b  [12] us-west1-c  [13] us-west1-a It won't take us-central1. Can you please respond in main chat instead of text box? text box should only be for final artifacts and code. Which one?\n\nGemini: From the list you provided, the zones within the us-central1 region are options 7, 8, 9, and 10:\n\n[7] us-central1-c\n[8] us-central1-a\n[9] us-central1-f\n[10] us-central1-b\nPlease choose one of these us-central1 ZONES.\n\nRecommendation: Choose option [8] us-central1-a or option [10] us-central1-b.\n\nWhy us-central1-a or us-central1-b?\n\nThese are common and widely used zones within the us-central1 region.\nFor MVP purposes, the specific zone within us-central1 is generally not critical. Choosing a or b is a reasonable default.\nTo proceed with the configuration, please enter either 8 or 10 and press ENTER.\n\nAfter you choose a zone, the gcloud configuration should continue.\n\nAnd yes, you are absolutely right to remind me - text boxes are only for final artifacts and code outputs. I will keep our ongoing conversation in the main chat. Thank you for the correction!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
