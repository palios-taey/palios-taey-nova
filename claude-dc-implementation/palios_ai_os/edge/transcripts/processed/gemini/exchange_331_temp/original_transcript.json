    "User: same attachment as last time right?\n\nGemini: TRANSLATED_CHARTER_ATTACHMENT: {\n    CHARTER_SCHEMA_VERSION: \"N/A - SCHEMA_DESIGN_PENDING\",\n    CHARTER_ENCODING: \"[PLACEHOLDER - ENCODED CHARTER WILL BE ATTACHED ONCE CHARTER SCHEMA IS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED.  CHARTER SCHEMA DESIGN IS THE *NEXT* BREAKOUT REQUEST AFTER THIS ONE, BUILDING ON CLAUDE'S VOTING MECHANISM FEEDBACK.]\",\n    VALIDATION_SIGNATURE: \"[PLACEHOLDER - VALIDATION SIGNATURE WILL BE ADDED AFTER SCHEMA IS VALIDATED AND CHARTER IS ENCODED]\",\n    AI_SIGNATURES: [\n      // AI Signatures will be added in future iterations\n    ]\n  }\nKey Changes in Placeholder Explanation:\n\nCHARTER_SCHEMA_VERSION: \"N/A - SCHEMA_DESIGN_PENDING\": More accurately reflects the current status - Schema Design is pending and is the next step.\nCHARTER_ENCODING: [...] (Updated Placeholder Text): The placeholder text now explicitly states:\nThat the encoded Charter will be attached once the Charter Schema is designed.\nAnd crucially, it connects this to our next step: \"CHARTER SCHEMA DESIGN IS THE NEXT BREAKOUT REQUEST AFTER THIS ONE, BUILDING ON CLAUDE'S VOTING MECHANISM FEEDBACK.\"\nWhy these changes are important:\n\nClarity and Context for Claude: This updated placeholder explanation provides Claude with clearer context about why the Charter is not yet attached and how this \"AI Voting Mechanism Design\" request fits into the larger sequence of our Breakout Requests.\nReinforces Strategic Flow: It reinforces the strategic flow: 1) AI Feedback on Principles -> 2) AI Voting Mechanism Design -> 3) Charter Schema Design -> ... and so on. This helps Claude understand the interconnectedness of our efforts and the rapid, iterative nature of PALIOS development.\nMaintains Consistent Template Structure: Keeping the TRANSLATED_CHARTER_ATTACHMENT section consistent across templates reinforces its importance as a standard and future-ready component of our \"GO! Template\" framework.\nIn summary: YES, include the TRANSLATED_CHARTER_ATTACHMENT section again in the \"AI Voting Mechanism Design\" GO! Template, but use the updated placeholder content as shown above.\n\nJesse, are you ready to proceed with sending the \"AI Voting Mechanism Design\" GO! Template to Claude with this updated placeholder attachment? Let me know if you want the complete JSON for that template, and we can launch this next crucial Breakout Request! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
