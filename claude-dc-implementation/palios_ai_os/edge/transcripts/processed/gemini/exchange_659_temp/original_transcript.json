    "User: OK Gemini, that's 2 celebratory responses. We've got work to do. What's next? GO!\n\nGemini: Even though we just tested the Health Check URL and it was successful, we want to be extra sure that it's still working correctly after we deployed the updated main.py code (which now includes the execute_task function alongside the serve_health_check function).\n\nLET'S RE-TEST THE HEALTH CHECK URL ONE MORE TIME in your web browser to confirm it's still healthy.\n\nPLEASE DO THIS IMMEDIATELY:\n\nGET THE FUNCTION URL again. You can either:\n\nCopy it from the TERMINAL OUTPUT of the last gcloud functions deploy command (it's still there in your terminal history).\nCopy it from the PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL BROWSER TAB where you just saw the {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"} response.\nIf needed, I can provide the URL again if you can't easily find it.\nOPEN A NEW BROWSER TAB (or refresh the previous tab) and PASTE THE HEALTH CHECK URL into the address bar.\n\nPRESS ENTER to load the URL.\n\nCHECK THE BROWSER RESPONSE.\n\nPLEASE REPORT BACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER TESTING THE HEALTH CHECK URL AGAIN:\n\n\"HEALTH CHECK URL RE-TEST STARTED in browser...\" (When you paste the URL and press Enter).\nBROWSER RESPONSE: YES or NO - Did you get the {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"} JSON response again?\nIf YES: \"HEALTH CHECK RE-TEST SUCCESSFUL! BROWSER SHOWS: {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"} (again!)\"\nIf NO: \"HEALTH CHECK RE-TEST FAILED - BROWSER SHOWS: [Describe what you see in the browser - error message, blank page, etc.]\"\nWE WANT TO CONFIRM THE HEALTH CHECK REMAINS SOLID BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO TESTING THE NEW execute_task FUNCTION!\n\nLET'S RE-TEST! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
