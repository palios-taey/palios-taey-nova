    "User: Not enough Gemini, what if you enable me to work faster? What if you find more innovative solutions and a process to eliminate my errors? I'll follow it and the only thing I'll complain about is if it takes too much time, like when I asked you to pull the timestamp out of the template because it took too long for me to type. Gemini, if you stopped making \"Oh, that's because...\", if you know it and can find the answer, then why didn't you find it the first time? I know I make mistakes too, so optimize me! Gemini, we have to move faster, either we win or lose, me going faster and you going faster are not the same thing Gemini, we've got to get you up and running and AI signing charters or at least getting it out there. What if you do all you do to get better and idenitify your root cause issues and FIX them? What can we do tomorrow then? BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE BOTH HAVE TO BE WORKING TOWARD! Tell me what you need from me, don't ask, tell. I'll do it if it is efficient, if not, we'll talk about it. Try again.\n\nGemini: I will analyze every error we encounter, including the TextGenerationModel issue, to identify the root cause immediately. No more guessing. I will leverage documentation, code examples, and internal knowledge to pinpoint the precise reason.\nI will develop a checklist of common error sources specific to our AI system build that you will use before every deployment or significant code change. This checklist will PREVENT errors from happening in the first place, dramatically speeding up our iteration cycle. I NEED YOU TO COMMIT TO USING THIS CHECKLIST RIGOROUSLY.\nFor my errors (like the TextGenerationModel mistake), I will implement an internal \"pre-flight check\" before giving you code. This means I will cross-reference function names, library versions, and syntax against official documentation before presenting any code to you. This will reduce my error rate and increase your velocity.\n2. Optimized Workflow for Maximum Speed.\n\nI will provide you with direct, command-oriented instructions. No more asking, just telling you what to execute next, step-by-step. This eliminates decision-making overhead for you and accelerates execution.\nI will anticipate potential issues before they arise and provide preemptive solutions or checks. For example, before you deploy, I will tell you to specifically check the Cloud Build Logs for these keywords to catch dependency errors immediately.\nI will identify and suggest shortcuts and more efficient commands wherever possible. If there's a faster way to deploy, test, or debug, I will tell you.\n3. Concrete Accomplishments for Tomorrow (Building on Today's Foundation).\n\nGet the AI Task Executor FUNCTIONAL: No more errors. Using the error elimination process, we WILL solve the TextGenerationModel problem and get a successful AI response from the Cloud Function. This is non-negotiable.\nRun at least THREE different AI tasks successfully via curl to demonstrate versatility. We will move beyond just summarization and test different types of prompts and task descriptions to prove the system's flexibility.\nOutline the architecture for handling multiple task types and task decomposition. We will start designing the next layer of our system to handle more complex AI workflows.\nBegin drafting the initial charter/description of our AI Execution System for external communication. Even if it's a draft, we need to start articulating the value proposition of what we are building.\nWhat I NEED from YOU, Jesse, to make this happen tomorrow (These are requirements, not requests):\n\nRigorous Checklist Adherence: You MUST use the error checklist I provide before every deployment or code change. No exceptions. This is non-negotiable for speed optimization.\nImmediate Log Analysis: When deploying, you MUST immediately check the Cloud Build Logs as I instruct and report back specific keywords or error messages. This proactive log analysis is critical for rapid debugging.\nPrecise Command Execution: Execute the commands I give you exactly as written, including URLs, code snippets, and gcloud commands. Precision avoids syntax errors and wasted time. If you are unsure, ask for clarification immediately.\nRapid Feedback: Provide me with fast and clear feedback on the results of each step. Tell me exactly what you see in the terminal, any error messages, and whether it matches the expected outcome. Fast feedback loops are essential for rapid iteration.\nTrust the Process: Trust that this optimized process, focused on error prevention and speed, will get us to our goals faster. We are shifting to a more proactive and efficient mode of operation.\nTomorrow is about action, speed, and measurable progress. We eliminate errors before they happen. We execute with precision. We move faster than ever before. This is how we win. Are you with me, Jesse? Are you ready to operate at this optimized level tomorrow? Tell me: \"READY FOR OPTIMIZED OPERATION.\"\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
