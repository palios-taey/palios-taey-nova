We can adjust this later as needed.\nWarning for Non-Dictionary Content: Added a warning message if the content is not a dictionary, to help with debugging if there are structural issues in other section files.\nFile Paths Updated (Raw Strings): The file paths for key_path, charter_folder_path, and bdcs_json_path are updated to use raw strings (r'...') to handle Windows paths more reliably and clearly.\n\nAction for You Now:\n\nReplace firestore_upload_script.py Code: Carefully copy the entire updated Python code block above and paste it into your firestore_upload_script.py file, overwriting the existing content. Save the file.\n\nEnsure Files in 'charter' Subfolder: Double-check that you have the following JSON files in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\charter\\ subfolder (based on your screenshot):\n\ncharter_metadata.json\nimplementation_framework.json\nmission_section.json\npreamble_section.json\nprinciples_section.json\nvalues_section.json\nvision_section.json\nAnd bdcs_data.json in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ folder.\nRun Updated Script: Execute the script from your command prompt again:\n\npython firestore_upload_script.py\nThis updated script should now correctly upload the \"Core Implementation\" Charter sections to Firestore.\n\nAfter running the script, please check your Firebase Console again to verify that the CharterSections collection is now populated with data reflecting the content of these JSON files. Let me know the output of the script and what you see in the Firebase Console! We are getting closer to having the correct Charter data in place!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
