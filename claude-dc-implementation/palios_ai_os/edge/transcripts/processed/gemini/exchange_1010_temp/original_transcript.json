    "User: Same errors, this is the main.tf file.\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_98eb84.png\n\nGemini: Please perform these steps VERY CAREFULLY and in order:\n\nVERIFY FILE PATH in FILE EXPLORER (not just Sublime Text):\n\nOpen WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER (not Git Bash, not Sublime Text).\nNavigate to the directory: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\\nCONFIRM that you see a file named main.tf in this directory.\nRIGHT-CLICK on the main.tf file in File Explorer.\nSelect \"Open with\" and choose \"Notepad\" (or a very basic text editor, not Sublime Text for this verification). This will open main.tf in Notepad.\nVERIFY FILE CONTENT in NOTEPAD:\n\nCAREFULLY compare the content you see in Notepad with the EXACT simplified code block I provided:\n\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    google = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/google\"\n      version = \"6.20.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"project_id\" {\n  description = \"GCP Project ID\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"ai-execution-system\" # Replace with your actual Project ID if different\n}\n\nvariable \"region\" {\n  description = \"GCP region\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"us-central1\"\n}\n\nvariable \"service_name\" {\n  type    = string\n  default = \"ai-execution-system-core\"\n}\n\n\nresource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" {\n  project   = var.project_id\n  region    = var.region\n  name      = \"${var.service_name}-healthcheck\"\n  schedule  = \"*/5 * * * *\"\n  time_zone = \"UTC\"\n  http_target {\n    http_method = \"GET\"\n    uri         = \"https://example.com/health\" # Placeholder URI for now\n  }\n}\nIs the content in Notepad EXACTLY this simplified code, with NO EXTRA LINES, NO EXTRA CODE, NO OLD CODE?\n\nIf there is ANY difference at all, carefully re-copy the simplified code block and PASTE it into Notepad, and then SAVE the file in Notepad.\n\nAfter verifying the file path and content using File Explorer and Notepad:\n\nClose Notepad.\nGo back to your Git Bash terminal (in the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory).\nRun terraform init -upgrade AGAIN:\nterraform init -upgrade\nRun terraform plan AGAIN:\nterraform plan\nThe goal of these meticulous steps is to ELIMINATE ANY POSSIBILITY of Terraform reading an outdated or incorrect main.tf file. By verifying in File Explorer and Notepad, we bypass any potential issues with Sublime Text or hidden files.\n\nPlease perform these verification steps VERY carefully, and then run terraform init -upgrade and terraform plan again. Provide the EXACT output of both commands.\n\nThis detailed file verification is crucial to resolve these persistent errors. Let's be absolutely certain about the file itself! We are in the home stretch! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
