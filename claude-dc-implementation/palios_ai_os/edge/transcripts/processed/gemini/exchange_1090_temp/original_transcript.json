Choose the \"Windows installer (64-bit)\" if you have a 64-bit Windows system, which is most common these days.\nRun the Python Installer:\n\nRun the downloaded installer .exe file.\nIMPORTANT: During the installation, make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python x.x to PATH\" (it's usually at the bottom of the first installation screen). This is crucial so that Python and pip are added to your system's PATH automatically.\nYou can usually accept the default installation options. Click \"Install Now\" or follow the prompts.\nAfter installation completes, open a NEW command prompt.\n\nVerify Python and pip are working from the new command prompt:\n\nType these commands and check the output:\n\npython --version\npip --version\npython --version: Should now show the version of the Python you just installed from python.org (not the Google Cloud SDK Python).\npip --version: Should now show the version of pip and should work without errors.\nPlease perform these steps to install Python from python.org, making sure to add Python to your PATH during installation. Then verify that both python --version and pip --version work in a new command prompt. Let me know once you've done this and what the output of those version commands is.\n\nOnce we have a working standard Python installation with pip, we can proceed to install git-filter-repo using pip install git-filter-repo and then finally remove those large files from your Git history! We are very close to resolving this!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
