    "User: The Terraform install created it's own directory in AI-Execution-System. Is this where it goes? Or do I create a separate folder for the deployment files?\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_8731a3.png\n\nGemini: Yes, you can use that existing terraform folder inside AI-Execution-System to create your deployment files.\n\nHere's what I recommend for simplicity and keeping things organized:\n\nNavigate to the AI-Execution-System directory.\nGo INSIDE the existing terraform folder.\nWithin this terraform folder, create your Terraform configuration files (.tf files).\nIn other words, YES, the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform\\ directory shown in your image is a good place to put your Terraform configuration files for deploying ai-system-backend-v2.\n\nYour terraform directory structure for deployment files will then look like this:\n\nAI-Execution-System/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 terraform/         # <---  Put your deployment files HERE\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.tf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 outputs.tf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 providers.tf\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... (other .tf files and modules if needed)\nYou do not need to create a separate folder outside of AI-Execution-System for deployment files. Keeping them inside the existing terraform directory within your project root is perfectly acceptable and keeps everything related to your AI execution system project contained within the AI-Execution-System directory.\n\nJust to reiterate to be super clear: The terraform folder in your image becomes your Terraform configuration directory for this deployment, not just the Terraform installation location.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense or if you have any other questions! Ready to get those Terraform files configured and deployed! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
