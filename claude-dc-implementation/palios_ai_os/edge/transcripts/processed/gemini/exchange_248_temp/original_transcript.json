Please open File Explorer and navigate to your C:\\ drive and confirm that the firebase_key.json file is present there.\nFilename Spelling: VERY IMPORTANT: Ensure that the filename is spelled exactly as firebase_key.json (all lowercase, with the underscore and .json extension). Even a small typo will cause this error.\nPath in Script:\n\nVerify that the key_path variable in your firestore_upload_script.py is exactly as follows:\n\nkey_path = r'C:\\firebase_key.json'\nRaw String r'...': Make sure you are using the raw string prefix r before the path string. This is important for Windows paths with backslashes.\nCorrect Path: Double-check that the path is C:\\firebase_key.json and not some other variation.\nAction for You Now:\n\nVerify File Existence and Filename: Please carefully check in File Explorer that the file firebase_key.json exists in your C:\\ drive and that the filename is spelled correctly.\n\nVerify key_path in Script: Open your firestore_upload_script.py file and confirm that the key_path line is exactly key_path = r'C:\\firebase_key.json'.\n\nOnce you have verified these two points, please let me know your findings.\n\nIf you confirm that the file does exist at C:\\firebase_key.json and the key_path in the script is correct, then there might be a more unusual issue (like permissions, although less likely in this case). We can investigate further if this is the case.\n\nMost likely, the issue is a simple typo in the filename or the path. Correcting this should resolve the FileNotFoundError.\n\nLet's get this file path issue resolved, and then we can rerun the script and get the Charter data uploaded correctly!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
