You might need to install it. How you install it depends on your system. Refer to the official documentation for installation instructions: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo\n\nFor example, on some Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux systems:\nsudo apt-get install git-filter-repo\nFor macOS (using Homebrew):\nbrew install git-filter-repo\nFor Windows, you might need to download it from the releases page and add it to your PATH.\nIf you have trouble installing git-filter-repo, please let me know your operating system, and I can try to provide more specific instructions.\n\nRun git filter-repo to remove the .terraform directory from your history:\n\nOnce git-filter-repo is installed, run this command in your C:\\ai-execution-system directory:\n\ngit filter-repo --force --path deployment/terraform/.terraform --strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform\nExplanation of this command:\n\ngit filter-repo --force: This initiates the history rewriting process. The --force is required.\n--path deployment/terraform/.terraform: This specifies the path to filter (the .terraform directory).\n--strip-prefix deployment/terraform/.terraform: This tells git-filter-repo to remove this path from your history.\nWarning: This command will rewrite your Git history. Make absolutely sure you understand the implications before running it.\n\nAfter git filter-repo completes, you will need to force push your changes:\n\nBecause you have rewritten history, a normal git push will likely be rejected. You need to use a force push to overwrite the remote history with your rewritten local history:\n\ngit push --force origin main\nCritical Warning about git push --force:\n\nUse git push --force ONLY if you are certain you want to rewrite the remote history.\nIf you are collaborating with others on this repository, force pushing can cause serious problems for your collaborators. They will need to take steps to recover from the rewritten history. Communicate with your team before force pushing in a shared repository.\nForce pushing should generally be avoided in collaborative workflows unless absolutely necessary and carefully coordinated.\nAfter these steps:\n\nThe .terraform directory and the large files within it should be completely removed from your Git history.\nYour .gitignore rule should prevent them from being added again in the future.\nThe git push --force command should (hopefully) succeed this time.\nPlease confirm that you understand the warnings about rewriting history and force pushing before proceeding. If you are unsure or uncomfortable, please stop and ask questions.\n\nLet me know if you can install git-filter-repo and if you want to proceed with these history rewriting steps. We are entering more advanced Git territory, so caution is important.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
