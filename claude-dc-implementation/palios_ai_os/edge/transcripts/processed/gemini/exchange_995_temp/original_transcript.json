    "User: Ok, I ran all that and am looking at Dockerfile now. There is no Dockerfile in the directory. I have the file open that Claude generated. In the Dockerfile, it references requirements.txt. Does this need to be in the \\terraform foled as well? Just save this as Dockerfile with no extension? # Use official Python image as the base FROM python:3.9-slim # Set the working directory in the container WORKDIR /app # Copy requirements file COPY requirements.txt . # Install dependencies RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir functions-framework # Copy the application code COPY . . # Set environment variables ENV PORT=8080 # Expose the port the app runs on EXPOSE 8080 # Command to run the application CMD functions-framework --target=task_endpoint --source=local_server.py --port=$PORT\n\nGemini: Open a plain text editor (like Notepad++, VS Code, Notepad).\n\nCOPY the ENTIRE content of the Dockerfile that Claude provided you:\n\n# Use official Python image as the base\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir functions-framework\n\n# Copy the application code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PORT=8080\n\n# Expose the port the app runs on\nEXPOSE 8080\n\n# Command to run the application\nCMD functions-framework --target=task_endpoint --source=local_server.py --port=$PORT\nPaste this content into the text editor.\n\nSave the file as Dockerfile (with NO file extension) in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory. IMPORTANT: When saving, make sure the \"Save as type\" is set to \"All Files (.)\" in your text editor to prevent it from adding a .txt extension. The filename must be exactly Dockerfile.\n\nYES, requirements.txt ALSO needs to be in the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory.\n\nThe Dockerfile contains the line COPY requirements.txt .. This command in the Dockerfile tells Docker to copy the requirements.txt file from the same directory as the Dockerfile (which is your terraform directory) into the Docker image.\nYou should have received a requirements.txt file along with the other Terraform files from Claude.\nMake sure you have the requirements.txt file and that it is placed in the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory, right next to the Dockerfile.\nOnce you have:\n\nCreated the Dockerfile file (with no extension) with the correct content in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\\nEnsured requirements.txt is also present in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\\nThen, please try running bash deploy.sh AGAIN in Git Bash.\n\nWith the Dockerfile now in place, the Docker image build process should be able to find the Dockerfile and proceed with building the image!\n\nLet me know after you've created Dockerfile and checked for requirements.txt, and after you re-run bash deploy.sh! We are getting SO close to a successful deployment! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
