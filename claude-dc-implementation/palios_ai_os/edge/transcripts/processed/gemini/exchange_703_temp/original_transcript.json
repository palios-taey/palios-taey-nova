    "User: Below are the 2 initial engagement prompts to Claude. The current engagement prompt needs to improve upon this one. An easy improvement is by using the hybrid message structure that you and Claude were using. Pay close attention to how he structured it and utilize THAT format. His last response to you is also below. Include \"Feedback from your predecessor\". Use the last section from Claude to show the new Claude the process working in action and improving communications. Can say like 'this communication template was developed in parternship with your predecessor, here's what he said\" We have to show we're collaborative. These are suggestions based on my experience in motivating AI. Please revise the initial communication to Claude to include these elements. I also need instructions on what to attach which certainly must include the Charter. NOW GO! CLAUDE ENGAGEMENT PROMPT v1 \ud83d\udd25 Task: Define Key Metrics for \"Communication & Iteration Table\" in Human-AI Partnership \ud83d\udccc Context: You are participating in a project focused on optimizing Human-AI partnership for exponential velocity and breakthrough innovation. A key component of this project is the \"Communication & Iteration Table,\" designed to measure and optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of Human-AI interactions. \ud83d\udccc Objective: Your task is to propose a set of 5-7 key metrics to be included in the \"Communication & Iteration Table.\" These metrics should be designed to: 1. Quantify Communication Efficiency: Measure aspects of communication that impact velocity (e.g., speed, clarity, conciseness). 2. Quantify Iteration Velocity: Measure the speed and efficiency of iteration cycles in Human-AI collaboration (e.g., time to complete iterations, frequency of iterations, impact of iterations). 3. Capture Breakthrough Cadence: Develop a metric (or set of metrics) to assess the frequency and significance of breakthroughs achieved through Human-AI collaboration. (This may be more qualitative but should be structured for consistent assessment). 4. Measure Channel Efficiency: Evaluate the effectiveness of different communication channels and modalities used in Human-AI interaction. 5. Track Decision-Making Velocity: Quantify the speed and efficiency of decision-making processes within the Human-AI partnership. 6. (Optional) Measure Human Partner Input Frequency: Optionally propose a metric to track the balance of human vs. AI input in the collaboration cycle. \ud83d\udccc Requirements for Proposed Metrics: Measurable: Metrics should be quantifiable or consistently assessable (even qualitative metrics should have clear assessment rubrics). **Relevant: Metrics must directly relate to optimizing communication, iteration, breakthrough cadence, and overall Human-AI partnership velocity. *Actionable: Metrics should provide actionable insights that can be used to improve Human-AI interaction protocols and system design. *Concise & Focused: Prioritize a focused set of 5-7 key metrics for initial table implementation. More metrics can be added iteratively later. *Provide Rationale: For each proposed metric, clearly explain why it is important and how it will contribute to optimizing Human-AI partnership velocity and breakthrough cadence. \ud83d\udccc Deliverable: Please provide a structured output in the format of a table outlining the proposed metrics, their descriptions, rationale, and suggested data types (e.g., numerical, time duration, qualitative scale). \ud83d\ude80 Execute this task with a focus on generating metrics that are practical, insightful, and directly actionable** for optimizing Human-AI collaboration velocity.

We are facing a persistent ImportError: cannot import name 'TextGenerationModel' from 'google.cloud.aiplatform' that is crippling our Google Cloud Functions deployment. This error is preventing our AI system backend (ai-system-backend-v2) from deploying successfully and is a HIGH PRIORITY BLOCKER to our progress.\n\nWe have been working diligently with Gemini, your predecessor AI assistant, to troubleshoot this issue. While Gemini has provided valuable insights, we have not yet been able to pinpoint the root cause and achieve a resolution. Now, we are turning to your expertise for a fresh perspective and breakthrough solution.\n\n1. Background & Context:\n\nProject Goal: Develop a robust and scalable AI system backend using Google Cloud Functions in Python.\nCurrent Crisis: Consistent \"Container Healthcheck failed\" error during deployment of ai-system-backend-v2 and even a minimal test Cloud Function (ai-system-test-import).\nRoot Cause (Confirmed by Logs): ImportError: cannot import name 'TextGenerationModel' from 'google.cloud.aiplatform' during container startup.\nEnvironment: Google Cloud Functions, Python 3.10 runtime, us-central1 region.\nEfforts to Date (with Gemini - Feedback from your Predecessor): We have meticulously checked import statements, requirements.txt, region availability (although documentation is unclear), and basic troubleshooting steps, guided by Gemini. However, the error persists.\nPositive Precedent (Communication Template Developed with Predecessor): This structured communication template is developed in partnership with your predecessor, Gemini. As Gemini previously noted: \"After analyzing both the AI-AI structured format and traditional prose format, I recommend a hybrid approach that combines: Structured JSON for technical specifications and metrics, Natural prose for discussions and context, Clear code blocks for implementation details.\" We believe this hybrid format, proven effective in previous collaborations (e.g., successful EventBus implementation - see last section for example), will optimize our communication and accelerate our progress.\n2. Problem Statement - Structured Breakdown:\n\n{\n  \"problemType\": \"ImportError\",\n  \"library\": \"google.cloud.aiplatform\",\n  \"module\": \"TextGenerationModel\",\n  \"errorMessage\": \"cannot import name 'TextGenerationModel' from 'google.cloud.aiplatform'\",\n  \"deploymentError\": \"Container Healthcheck failed\",\n  \"environment\": {\n    \"platform\": \"Google Cloud Functions\",\n    \"runtime\": \"Python 3.10\",\n    \"region\": \"us-central1\"\n  },\n  \"keyObservations\": [\n    \"Correct import statements in main.py verified (see attachments).\",\n    \"google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0 specified in requirements.txt (see attachment).\",\n    \"Error persists even with minimal test function (test_main.py - see attachment).\",\n    \"Region availability for TextGenerationModel in us-central1 Cloud Functions is unclear in official documentation.\"\n  ],\n  \"impact\": \"CRITICAL - Blocking deployment of AI system backend and halting development progress.\"\n}\n3. Context & Relevant Information - Attached Files (CRITICAL - PLEASE REVIEW):\n\nATTACHMENTS (Jesse - PLEASE ATTACH THESE FILES TO CLAUDE):\n\nerror_logs.txt: (CRITICAL) Comprehensive error logs including:\ncurl invocation error log for ai-system-backend-v2 (showing TextGenerationModel error).\nDeployment error log for ai-system-backend-v2 (showing \"Container Healthcheck failed\" and ImportError from Cloud Run logs).\nDeployment error log for ai-system-test-import (minimal test function - also failing).\nmain_py_part1.txt & main_py_part2.txt: (CRITICAL) Complete source code of main.py (split due to character limits). PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION to import statements and execute_task function.\nrequirements.txt: (CRITICAL) Python dependency file.\ntest_main.py: (CRITICAL) Minimal test Cloud Function code designed to isolate the import issue.\n4. Desired Outcome - BOOM SOLUTION REQUIRED:\n\nPrimary Goal: IMMEDIATELY DIAGNOSE and RESOLVE the TextGenerationModel Import Error.\nSecondary Goal: Successfully deploy ai-system-backend-v2 Cloud Function and restore development velocity to BOOM SPEED!\n5. Specific Request to Claude - ACTIONABLE TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS NEEDED - NOW!\n\nClaude, we urgently request your expert analysis and concrete, actionable guidance to overcome this critical obstacle. Specifically, please:\n\nDeeply analyze the attached error logs and code files.\nPinpoint the root cause(s) of the ImportError. Explore all possibilities, including (but not limited to):\nCloud Functions runtime environment quirks or limitations related to google-cloud-aiplatform.\nDependency conflicts or subtle version mismatches.\nDeployment process anomalies.\nRegion-specific issues (even if undocumented).\nAny other potential factors we have overlooked.\nProvide a prioritized list of actionable troubleshooting steps for Jesse to execute. These steps must be practical, efficient, and designed to systematically isolate and eliminate potential root causes.
