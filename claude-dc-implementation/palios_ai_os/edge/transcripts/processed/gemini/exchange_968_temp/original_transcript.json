    "User: Ok, where should terraform.exe be located?\n\nGemini: Here's why this is a good location:\n\nSimplicity and Easy Access: C:\\terraform\\ is a very straightforward and easy-to-remember path. It's directly at the root of your C: drive, making it simple to navigate to.\nDedicated Terraform Executable Folder: Putting terraform.exe in its own folder keeps it organized and separate from other files. You can think of C:\\terraform\\ as the designated \"Terraform executables\" folder.\nCommon Practice (Informal): While not a strict requirement, placing executables in a dedicated folder at the root of the drive (or in C:\\Program Files\\ for more formal installations) is a common practice on Windows for organization.\nSteps to Move terraform.exe and Update PATH:\n\nCreate the terraform Folder:\n\nOpen File Explorer.\nGo to your C: drive.\nCreate a new folder named terraform (all lowercase). You should now have C:\\terraform\\.\nLocate your terraform.exe file. Find the .zip file you downloaded from the Terraform website and extract it. Inside the extracted folder, find terraform.exe.\n\nMove terraform.exe to C:\\terraform\\. Copy or move the terraform.exe file into the C:\\terraform\\ folder you just created. So, terraform.exe should now be directly inside C:\\terraform\\.\n\nUpdate your PATH environment variable:\n\nOpen the Start Menu and search for \"environment variables\".\nSelect \"Edit the system environment variables\".\nClick the \"Environment Variables...\" button in the System Properties window.\nIn the \"System variables\" section, find and select the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit...\".\nClick \"New\" and add the following EXACTLY: C:\\terraform (This is the path to the folder containing terraform.exe).\nClick \"OK\" on all open windows to save.\nVERIFY TERRAFORM INSTALLATION:\n\nCLOSE all command prompts.\nOpen a NEW command prompt.\nType: terraform --version\nPress Enter.\nYou MUST see the Terraform version output. If you still get \"'terraform' is not recognized...\", double-check:\n\nYou added C:\\terraform (exactly) to the PATH.\nterraform.exe is definitely in C:\\terraform\\ folder.\nYou closed and reopened the command prompt.\nOnce terraform --version works from ANY command prompt, you are good to go with Terraform installation! Then you can navigate back to your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform\\ directory (your deployment configuration directory) and run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply.\n\nLet me know if you have any trouble with these steps! We are getting closer to deployment! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
