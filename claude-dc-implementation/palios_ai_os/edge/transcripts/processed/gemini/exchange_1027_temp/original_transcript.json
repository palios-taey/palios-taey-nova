    "User: This is updated Dockerfile. Do you want me to move files out of the terraform directory that are not scripts of some kind? FROM python:3.9-slim-buster WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install -r requirements.txt COPY . /app/ RUN ls -l /app/ ENV PORT=8080 EXPOSE 8080 CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n\nGemini: Let's do these two CRITICAL things FIRST to troubleshoot the flask issue:\n\nVERIFY requirements.txt CONTENT:\n\nPlease COPY and PASTE the EXACT CONTENT of your requirements.txt file here. We need to make absolutely sure that flask is listed in this file. It should look something like this:\n\nflask\n# ... other dependencies ...\nIf flask is NOT in requirements.txt, you need to ADD flask to requirements.txt, save the file, and then run universal-deploy-script.sh again.\n\nCHECK CLOUD BUILD LOGS for pip install ERRORS:\n\nGo back to the Cloud Build logs URL from your last deployment attempt.\nFind the \"build\" step in the logs again.\nCarefully EXAMINE the output of the RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt command in the build logs.\nLook for ANY ERROR MESSAGES or WARNINGS during the pip install process. Even if the step says \"SUCCESS\" overall, scroll through the output of pip install itself. There might be errors or warnings that indicate why flask is not being installed correctly.\nCOPY and PASTE any ERROR messages or WARNINGS from the pip install output here.\nAfter you have verified your requirements.txt content and checked the Cloud Build logs for pip install errors, please provide me with:\n\nThe content of your requirements.txt file.\nAny ERROR or WARNING messages from the pip install -r /app/requirements.txt step in the Cloud Build logs.\nOnce we have this information, we can figure out why flask is not being installed and how to fix it! Let's solve this flask problem right now! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
