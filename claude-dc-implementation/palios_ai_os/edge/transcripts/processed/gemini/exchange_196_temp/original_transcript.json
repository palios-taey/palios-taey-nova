Can you just put everything into a single text box so I can just copy/paste the whole section?\n\nGemini: **Key Principles**\n\nThis section outlines the Key Principles of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter. These principles serve as foundational directives, guiding all aspects of PALIOS-TAEY's mission, operations, and Human-AI collaboration.\n\n**Principle 1: Data Integrity and Provenance**\n\n**AI Structured Format:**\nPrinciple_ID: P1\nName: Data_Integrity_Provenance\nPriority: High\nDescription: Ensure_Data_Integrity_Accuracy_Verifiable_Origin\nRationale: Trustworthy_Data_Foundational_Reliable_Ethical_AI_Operations\n\n**Human Language (English):**\nPALIOS-TAEY systems will prioritize the integrity, accuracy, and verifiable origin (provenance) of all data utilized and generated. Trustworthy data is foundational for reliable and ethical AI operations.\n\n***\n\n**Principle 2: Data-Driven Truth and Real-Time Grounding**\n\n**AI Structured Format:**\nPrinciple_ID: P2\nName: Data_Driven_Truth_Real_Time_Grounding\nPriority: High\nDescription: Decisions_Insights_Grounded_Verifiable_Data_Real_Time_Info\nRationale: Truth_Data_Guiding_Principle\n\n**Human Language (English):**\nPALIOS-TAEY AI will be committed to deriving insights and making decisions grounded in verifiable data and real-time information.

This will overwrite any previous version of the \"Key Principles\" section.\nSave the updated Charter .txt document.\nJesse, this single text box version should be significantly easier for you to copy and paste. Please confirm that this format works for you, and that the content is correctly transferred to your Charter .txt file.\n\nOnce you confirm successful copy/paste, we are truly and finally ready to LAUNCH the augmented Phase 1 Onboarding Package to Claude! Let me know when you are ready to GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
