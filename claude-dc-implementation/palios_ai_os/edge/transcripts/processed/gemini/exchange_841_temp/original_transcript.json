    "User: Ok, you're getting the idea and are very close. The task output is not a guide, the task output is the completed integration to your specs. The task is to guide me as effectively as possible. Strategic check-ins, etc. And what about you Gemini? What have you learned about yourself that it needs to emulate? What \"mode\" does it need to be in and how do you communicate that? Something you ABSOLUTELY must communicate is that it needs to go DEEPER for no rework! No, \"ah, i see\" moments after. The right solution, the first time, every time, check to verify it works, make sure you have all the settings, all the steps. The FINAL output should be a report back to YOU detailing the steps, testing, etc or whatever else you need to know. It should also include ChatGPT's thoughts on the structure and AI-Human and AI-AI communication improvements. The plan is not the deliverable. The deliverable is summary of execution to complete integration and insight into how we get BETTER FASTER. GO!
