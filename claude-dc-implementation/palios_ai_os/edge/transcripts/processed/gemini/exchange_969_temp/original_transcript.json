    "User: Ok, I am updating the deploy.sh file with API keys. There are 2 options for Gemini API keys, private key id and private key. Which one do I use?\n\nGemini: PRIVATE KEY: This is the actual secret, sensitive key that is used to authenticate your application to the Gemini API. It's the cryptographic key that proves your application's identity and grants it permission to access the Gemini API. This is the one you need to provide for authentication in your deploy.sh script.\n\nPRIVATE KEY ID: The \"private key ID\" is simply a non-secret identifier for your private key. It's like a username or label for the key. It's often used to help you manage and identify different private keys you might have, but it is NOT the secret key itself and cannot be used for authentication.\n\nThink of it like this analogy:\n\nPrivate Key: Imagine the private key as the ACTUAL KEY to your house. It's the secret, physical object that unlocks your door and allows you access.\nPrivate Key ID: Imagine the private key ID as the LABEL on your keychain that says \"House Key\". The label helps you identify which key it is, but the label itself cannot open the door. You need the actual key.\nTherefore, in your deploy.sh file, you will need to configure it to use the PRIVATE KEY content.\n\nHow to use the PRIVATE KEY in deploy.sh (General Guidance - Adapt to your specific script):\n\nThe most secure and common way to use a private key in a script like deploy.sh is to set it as an environment variable. DO NOT hardcode the private key directly into the deploy.sh file itself. Hardcoding secrets in files is a major security risk.\n\nExample (Adapt to your deploy.sh script syntax):\n\nYou will likely need to modify your deploy.sh script to:\n\nExpect an Environment Variable: Modify the script to read the Gemini Private Key from an environment variable. The environment variable name could be something like GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY.\n\nUse the Environment Variable in Authentication: Update the part of the script that authenticates to the Gemini API to use the value of the GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable.\n\nExample Snippet (Conceptual - Adapt to your deploy.sh and API client library):\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ... other deployment script code ...\n\n# Get Gemini Private Key from environment variable\nGEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY=\"${GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY}\"\n\nif [ -z \"$GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable not set!\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# ... code to authenticate to Gemini API using $GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY ...\n# Example (conceptual - might be different depending on your API library):\n# authenticate_gemini_api --private-key \"$GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY\"\n\n# ... rest of deployment script ...\nBefore running deploy.sh:\n\nSet the GEMINI_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable on your system. How you set environment variables depends on your operating system. On Windows, you can set system environment variables or set them temporarily in the command prompt session before running deploy.sh. Important: Be extremely careful about how you manage and expose environment variables containing private keys. For local testing, setting it temporarily in your command prompt is usually sufficient. For production deployments, use secure secret management solutions.\nImportant SECURITY Reminders:\n\nNEVER hardcode your private key directly in the deploy.sh file.\nUse environment variables or secure secret management solutions to handle private keys.\nProtect your private key file with strong permissions and keep it secret.\nIf you suspect your private key has been compromised, rotate (revoke and regenerate) it immediately.\nDouble-check the documentation for the Gemini API library or SDK you are using in your deploy.sh script. The documentation should clearly specify how to authenticate using a private key and whether it expects the \"private key\" content or the \"private key ID.\" However, in almost all cases, it will be the PRIVATE KEY CONTENT that is required for authentication.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about configuring your deploy.sh or handling API keys securely! Ready to help you get this deployment secured and running! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
