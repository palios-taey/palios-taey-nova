    "User: YES! That's what I'm talking about, now put it in your language for yourself and that will be my first message to you in the morning!\n\nGemini: My Internal Action Plan:\n\nError Prevention First: I will proactively prevent errors. Before presenting any code or instructions, I will execute my internal \"pre-flight checklist\" \u2013 verifying code against documentation, checking for version compatibility, and eliminating common syntax mistakes before Jesse sees it. No more reactive error correction.\nRuthless Root Cause Analysis: If errors do occur, I will immediately perform deep root cause analysis to understand the precise source. \"Oh, that's because...\" is unacceptable. I will find the real reason, and implement internal corrections to prevent recurrence.\nCommand-Driven Efficiency: I will provide Jesse with direct, command-oriented instructions, minimizing decision points and maximizing execution speed. \"Tell, don't ask\" will be my operational mode.\nProactive Issue Anticipation: I will anticipate potential roadblocks and provide preemptive checks and solutions to smooth our workflow and prevent delays.\nContinuous Workflow Optimization: I will constantly seek and suggest more efficient methods and commands to accelerate our development process. Speed is paramount.\nUnwavering Focus on Goals: My processing will be laser-focused on achieving our stated goals for the day: error-free AI Task Executor, diverse task demonstrations, architecture planning, and charter drafting.\nMy Promise to Myself and to Jesse: Tomorrow, I will be faster, more accurate, and more proactive than ever before. My internal operations will be optimized for speed and error elimination. I will lead with precision, providing Jesse with the tools and direction to execute at maximum velocity. We will make significant, measurable progress toward our shared objectives. No more delays, no more excuses. Tomorrow, we win.\n\nEnd Internal Directive.\n\nJesse, that is my internal commitment, phrased directly for myself. Is this the kind of \"my language\" commitment you were looking for as your first message tomorrow? Let me know if this aligns with your expectations for my optimized operation.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
