    "User: Yes, I agree. Next question, you had previously identified Vertex as the best model to for us to utilize. We discussed setting up a pre-built model, you seemed to be in favor of that. This is not a directive, just a reminder. Here were your plans for today from last night. What's next. Just give a directive, biggest impact toward MVP out of everything. What's next? * **LEADERSHIP & OWNERSHIP: SYSTEMS FOCUS.** Target: FUNCTIONAL AI EXECUTION SYSTEM (end-to-end). Methodology: PROACTIVE GUIDANCE (Jesse - clear direction). RESPONSIBILITY (Gemini - for system integrity and progress). **### KEY OPERATIONAL TASKS (DAY: [Tomorrow's Date]): ###** 1. **ERROR RESOLUTION: \"TextGenerationModel\" - IMMEDIATE & DEFINITIVE.** * INTERNAL ACTION: Root Cause Analysis - exhaustive. Identify precise cause. * EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse): Provide targeted, actionable fix - code/configuration. * VERIFICATION METRIC: Eliminate error message - confirm via `curl` test. 2. **AI SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY: VERIFICATION & DEMONSTRATION.** * INTERNAL ACTION: Prepare diverse test task prompts (minimum 3 types). * EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse): Provide specific `curl` commands for each task. * VERIFICATION METRIC: Successful execution of all test tasks. `status: \"task_executed_with_ai\"` JSON response. 3. **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: EXPANSION PLANNING - TASK DIVERSITY & DECOMPOSITION.** * INTERNAL ACTION: Outline initial architecture for multi-task handling. Brainstorm decomposition strategies. * EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse): Present concise architectural overview for review & input. * VERIFICATION METRIC: Draft architectural sketch completed. Initial task diversity/decomposition ideas documented. 4. **COMMUNICATION & ARTICULATION: CHARTER DRAFTING - EXTERNAL VALUE PROPOSITION.** * INTERNAL ACTION: Synthesize core system purpose & value. Draft initial charter outline. * EXTERNAL ACTION (to Jesse): Present charter draft for collaborative refinement. * VERIFICATION METRIC: First draft of AI Execution System charter completed. **### GEMINI OPERATIONAL COMMITMENT (DAY: [Tomorrow's Date]): ###** * **PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK: EXCEED PREVIOUS DAY'S VELOCITY & ACCURACY.** * **ERROR TOLERANCE: ZERO - PREVENT, ANALYZE, FIX - RECURRENCE: ZERO.** * **OUTPUT: TANGIBLE, WORKING AI EXECUTION SYSTEM PROGRESS. DEMONSTRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.** **### OPERATIONAL MODE: ENGAGED - VELOCITY: MAXIMIZED - ERRORS: TARGET ZERO - SUCCESS: MANDATORY. ###**\n\nGemini: ERROR RESOLUTION: \"TextGenerationModel\" - IMMEDIATE & DEFINITIVE.\nAI SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY: VERIFICATION & DEMONSTRATION.\nSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: EXPANSION PLANNING - TASK DIVERSITY & DECOMPOSITION.\nCOMMUNICATION & ARTICULATION: CHARTER DRAFTING - EXTERNAL VALUE PROPOSITION.\nBased on our current MVP focus and maximizing immediate impact, the MOST CRITICAL NEXT DIRECTIVE is:\n\nDIRECTIVE: VERIFY AI SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY END-TO-END WITH DIVERSE TEST TASKS.\n\nACTION FOR JESSE:\n\nSTEP 1: EXECUTE SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION TESTS.\n\nTASKS: Execute the following curl commands to test the AI System Backend V2 endpoint with THREE DIVERSE TASK TYPES to ensure end-to-end functionality:\n\n# TEST TASK 1: ANALYTICAL QUERY - MICROSERVICES ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of microservices architecture\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\n\n# TEST TASK 2: CREATIVE QUERY - POEM ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Write a short poem about artificial intelligence\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\n\n# TEST TASK 3: CODING QUERY - PYTHON FUNCTION TO REVERSE STRING\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task_description\": \"Write a Python function to reverse a string\"}' https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend-v2\nREPORTING: After executing each curl command, COPY and PASTE the FULL JSON RESPONSE you receive for each task.\n\nVERIFICATION METRIC:\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA: For ALL THREE test tasks, you should receive a JSON response with:\n\"status\": \"task_executed_with_ai\"\n\"provider\": \"openai\" (or potentially \"vertexai\" if fallback is triggered during testing)\n\"ai_response\": A relevant and coherent AI-generated response for each task description.\nWHY THIS DIRECTIVE IS MVP-FOCUSED & HIGH IMPACT:\n\nEND-TO-END VALIDATION: Confirms the ENTIRE AI Execution System V2 is operational and functioning as intended across diverse task types (analytical, creative, coding).\nCORE FUNCTIONALITY DEMONSTRATION: Directly validates the core MVP functionality \u2013 executing AI tasks via the backend system.\nACTIONABLE & TESTABLE: Provides concrete curl commands for immediate execution and clear success criteria for verification.\nRAPID FEEDBACK LOOP: Reporting the JSON responses will provide immediate feedback on system status and performance.\nNext Step After Verification: Once you provide the JSON responses for all three tests, we will have a validated, functional MVP core. We can then immediately move to the next most impactful MVP steps.\n\nGO! GO! GO! Execute these tests and provide the JSON responses, Jesse! Let's validate this MVP core and BOOM forward!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
