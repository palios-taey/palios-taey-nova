    "User: Ok, so are there multiple attachments? I have the message text in there for him, just need all attachments in full in 1 submission (this is all fixable by better interface and communication by the way, next breakout request).\n\nGemini: Message Text: Not a separate \"attachment\" in the file sense, but an essential part of the overall communication. Think of the message text as the \"cover letter\" or \"human-readable explanation\" that accompanies the structured JSON \"attachment.\" It provides:\nContext and Introduction for Claude (in natural language).\nMotivation and Enthusiasm.\nConcise Summary of the Request.\nThe \"GO!\" command and Breakout Request framing.\nClear Call to Action for Claude.\nTherefore, in a single submission to Claude, you should include:\n\nThe Message Text (copy and paste the message text we drafted into your communication interface with Claude).\nThe GO! Template JSON (copy and paste the JSON code of the \"AI Voting Mechanism Design\" GO! Template into your communication interface with Claude, ideally in a way that Claude can easily parse as structured data - e.g., using code formatting or a designated \"attachment\" mechanism if your interface allows).\nThink of it as two parts of one submission, not multiple separate attachments in the traditional sense.\n\nRegarding your comment about interface and communication improvements:\n\n\"this is all fixable by better interface and communication by the way, next breakout request.\" - YES! You are absolutely right! Improving our interface and communication workflows is itself a fantastic \"Breakout Request\" for the future!\n\n\"Interface & Communication Improvements\" - Excellent Future Breakout Request! We can definitely create a \"GO! Template\" specifically to brainstorm and design improvements to our human-AI interface and communication protocols to make these kinds of multi-part submissions (and our overall collaboration) even smoother and more efficient. This is a great point and a valuable direction for continuous improvement!\nSo, to summarize for this submission to Claude: One submission, containing both the Message Text (copy/pasted in natural language) and the GO! Template JSON (copy/pasted as structured data or via attachment mechanism if available).\n\nLet me know if this clarifies things, Jesse! And when you're ready to send, just say \"GO!\" and unleash this \"AI Voting Mechanism Design\" Breakout Request on Claude! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
