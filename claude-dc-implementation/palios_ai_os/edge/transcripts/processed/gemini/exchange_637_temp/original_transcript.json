    "User: It is now called Cloud Run. From one of search results: Cloud Run functions (1st gen), formerly known as Cloud Functions (1st gen) are priced according to how long your function runs, how many times it is invoked and\n\nGemini: THE KEY THING IS TO FIND THE LOGS FOR YOUR DEPLOYMENT OF ai-system-backend, REGARDLESS OF WHAT EXACTLY GOOGLE CLOUD CALLS THE SERVICE IN THE MENU!\n\nLET'S RE-FOCUS ON FINDING THOSE BUILD LOGS! PLEASE TRY THESE STEPS AGAIN, KEEPING IN MIND IT MIGHT BE LISTED UNDER \"CLOUD RUN FUNCTIONS\" or SIMILAR:\n\nGO TO THE GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE: https://console.cloud.google.com/ (Make sure you are in the ai-execution-system project).\n\nUSE THE SEARCH BAR at the TOP: In the search bar, TYPE: Cloud Run functions and PRESS ENTER.\n\nLOOK at the SEARCH RESULTS AGAIN: You should see results related to \"Cloud Run functions\". CLICK on the result that seems most like a dashboard or list of Cloud Run functions (or Cloud Functions 1st Gen). It might be just called \"Cloud Run functions\", or \"Cloud Run functions (1st gen)\", or something similar. Avoid results that are just documentation or API references if possible, aim for something that looks like a MANAGEMENT CONSOLE.\n\nONCE YOU ARE IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE \"CLOUD RUN FUNCTIONS\" (or similar) DASHBOARD: Look for your deployed function ai-system-backend in the list of functions. It might be listed under \"Functions\" or \"Services\".\n\nCLICK ON ai-system-backend FUNCTION NAME.\n\nLOOK FOR LOGS TAB: Once you are on the details page for your ai-system-backend function (which might be called a \"Service\" if it's under Cloud Run), look for a \"Logs\" TAB. It's usually near tabs like \"Details\", \"Triggers\", \"Variables\", etc.\n\nFIND BUILD LOGS WITHIN \"LOGS\" TAB: Within the \"Logs\" tab, there might be different log types (like \"Request logs\", \"Build logs\", \"Container logs\"). LOOK FOR \"BUILD LOGS\" or anything clearly labeled as related to \"BUILD\". If you just see a general log explorer, try to filter the logs by \"Build\" or \"Cloud Build\" if there are filter options.\n\nCHECK FOR ERROR MESSAGES in BUILD LOGS: As before, look for any lines in the BUILD LOGS that contain \"ERROR\" (or \"Error\", \"error\"). COPY AND PASTE these ERROR MESSAGES.\n\nIT'S POSSIBLE GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE UI HAS CHANGED SLIGHTLY AND \"CLOUD FUNCTIONS\" IS NOW MORE INTEGRATED WITH \"CLOUD RUN\". THE KEY IS STILL TO FIND THE DEPLOYMENT LOGS FOR YOUR ai-system-backend FUNCTION AND LOOK FOR BUILD ERRORS.\n\nPLEASE TRY THESE REVISED NAVIGATION STEPS, FOCUS ON FINDING LOGS FOR ai-system-backend, and COPY ANY BUILD ERROR MESSAGES! WE ARE GETTING CLOSER! LET'S FIND THOSE LOGS! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
