(In the left-hand menu, click on \"Firestore Database\" and then select the results collection).\n\nLOOK for a DOCUMENT in the results collection where the task_id field is set to: 4ace33d7-a034-4691-82ae-786653ef43b6 (This is the DOCUMENT ID of the collaborative task we just verified in the tasks collection).\n\nIF YOU FIND A RESULT DOCUMENT with task_id: 4ace33d7-a034-4691-82ae-786653ef43b6, OPEN this RESULT DOCUMENT by clicking on its Document ID.\n\nONCE YOU HAVE OPENED THE RESULT DOCUMENT, VERIFY that you see these KEY FIELDS:\n\ntask_id FIELD: Double-check that it is indeed 4ace33d7-a034-4691-82ae-786653ef43b6.\nfinal_result FIELD: Is there a field named final_result? If YES, does it contain a long text value? (It might be truncated in the console, but just check if it's there and looks like a story).\nsubtask_results FIELD: Is there a field named subtask_results? If YES, is its VALUE an ARRAY?\nEXPAND the subtask_results ARRAY. Does it contain MULTIPLE OBJECTS?\nEXPAND ONE or TWO of the SUBTASK RESULT OBJECTS inside the subtask_results array. Do they contain a result field with some text content that looks like a result for a subtask?\nREPORT BACK ONCE YOU HAVE CHECKED THE results COLLECTION and (hopefully!) found the RESULT DOCUMENT for your collaborative task!\n\nTell me:\n\n\"YES, I FOUND THE RESULT DOCUMENT!\"\nThe DOCUMENT ID of the result document (just to confirm).\n\"YES, the task_id in the result document is 4ace33d7-a034-4691-82ae-786653ef43b6.\"\n\"YES, I see the final_result field, and it contains a long text (story).\" (Even if it's truncated in the console).\n\"YES, I see the subtask_results ARRAY.\"\n\"The subtask_results ARRAY contains approximately [NUMBER] subtask result objects.\" (Should be similar number to subtasks in the task document).\n\"YES, each subtask result object I checked has a result field with text content.\" (Confirming subtask execution results are stored).\nIf we can confirm these details in the results collection, then we have SOLID PROOF that COLLABORATIVE TASKS ARE WORKING END-TO-END! LET'S GO CHECK THE results COLLECTION NOW! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
