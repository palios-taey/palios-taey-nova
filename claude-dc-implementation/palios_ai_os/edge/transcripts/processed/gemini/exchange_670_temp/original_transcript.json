    "User: MODIFIED main.py - execute_task updated for AI task So that could have had the next step in this one. Want to try to get to doing instructions, testing and next action.\n\nGemini: EXECUTE this gcloud functions deploy COMMAND in your terminal IMMEDIATELY:\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point execute_task --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\nIMPORTANT: This is the same deployment command as before (with --entry-point execute_task), we are just re-running it to deploy the new version of main.py with the AI-powered execute_task function.\nWHILE THIS IS DEPLOYING, LET'S PREPARE FOR TESTING!\n\nTESTING INSTRUCTION: EXECUTE THIS curl COMMAND AFTER DEPLOYMENT:\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"task_description\\\": \\\"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\\\"}\" https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-backend\nThis curl command is similar to before, but with a new task_description: \"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\" This is a task that the language model should be able to handle!\nEXPECTED TEST RESULT:\n\nWhen you execute the curl command after successful deployment, we are expecting the TERMINAL OUTPUT to be a JSON response that now includes an \"ai_response\" field containing a summary of the plot of Inception generated by the PaLM 2 model! It should look something like this (the exact summary might vary slightly):\n\n{\n  \"task_description\": \"Summarize the plot of the movie 'Inception' in three sentences.\",\n  \"ai_response\": \"[A summary of Inception in three sentences generated by PaLM 2 model will be here]\",\n  \"status\": \"task_executed_with_ai\"\n}\nNEXT ACTION AFTER SUCCESSFUL TESTING:\n\nIf the curl command successfully returns the JSON response with the ai_response, then WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED THE \"BASIC TEXT GENERATION TASK\" MVP MILESTONE! This means:\n\nOur Cloud Function is deployed and healthy.\nIt can receive task descriptions.\nIt can use a language model (Vertex AI PaLM 2) to process the task description as a prompt.\nIt can return the AI model's response in a JSON format.\nONCE WE CONFIRM THIS SUCCESS, the next action will be to:\n\nEXPLORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TASKS: Experiment with sending various task descriptions to our Cloud Function to see how the PaLM 2 model performs with different prompts and requests.\nREFINE PROMPTING STRATEGIES: Start thinking about how to improve our task descriptions (prompts) to get more specific and better AI responses.\nTHINK ABOUT TASK DECOMPOSITION: Consider how we can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that our Cloud Function can execute.\nBUT FIRST, LET'S FOCUS ON DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING! EXECUTE THE gcloud functions deploy COMMAND NOW! THEN, AS SOON AS IT'S DEPLOYED, RUN THE curl TEST COMMAND! LET'S GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
