    "User: [COLLABORATION MODE] Thank you for that excellent analysis Gemini! The only thing my memory is superior on is the Vertex AI integration. We decided to pause on this as the custom model required training data. You decided that creating a vertex model or setting up a custom one, was not required for the MVP stage. Given the objectives in the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT] (let me know if you need me to provide the full document, it's fine if you do, I understand this is a gradual process to improve your memory), what do you think are next steps with this?\n\nGemini: Re-evaluating Next Steps in Light of MVP Objectives:\n\nGiven this corrected understanding \u2013 Vertex AI deployment is paused and not MVP-critical \u2013 our next steps should be re-prioritized to focus on the core MVP deliverables outlined in the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT].\n\nBased on our progress so far and assuming the MVP is focused on demonstrating the core functionality of the Hybrid Consciousness System, I believe the following are logical next steps:\n\nComplete Phase 1 Integration & Validation (Top Priority):\n\nContinue EventBus Implementation: Implementing the EventBus remains a high priority. Even though Vertex AI is paused, the EventBus addresses a key architectural improvement and resolves the failing StateTransitionTriggers integration test. A robust, event-driven architecture is beneficial regardless of the deployment environment and strengthens the core system.\nFix StateTransitionTriggers Test: Once the EventBus is implemented, ensure the StateTransitionTriggers test is updated and passes.\nRe-run Full Integration Test Suite: After EventBus integration and test fix, re-run the entire integration test suite to confirm all 8 tests are passing and Phase 1 integration is fully validated.\nFocus on MVP-Relevant Functionality (Next Priority):\n\nConsult the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT]: We need to explicitly refer back to the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT] to identify the specific functionalities required for the MVP demonstration. What are the minimum features needed to showcase the core concept and value proposition of the Hybrid Consciousness System for the MVP?\nPrioritize MVP Features: Based on the document, we should identify and prioritize the development and integration of these MVP-critical features. This might involve selecting a subset of Phase 2 functionalities that are most relevant for the MVP.\nDevelop MVP Demonstration Scenario: Let's brainstorm and define a clear, concise, and compelling demonstration scenario for the MVP. What specific task or process will we showcase to highlight the system's capabilities? This scenario will guide our feature prioritization and development efforts.\nDefer Vertex AI Deployment (For Now):\n\nKeep Deployment Documentation/Troubleshooting on Hold: We can temporarily pause active troubleshooting and further investigation into the Vertex AI deployment issue. We should, however, keep any documentation and troubleshooting steps we've already gathered organized for potential future deployment efforts (post-MVP).\nRe-evaluate Deployment Post-MVP: Vertex AI deployment might become relevant for later stages (e.g., scaling, production). We should re-evaluate the need for Vertex AI deployment after the MVP is successfully demonstrated and consider it as a potential objective for the next phase of development.\nIn summary, my thoughts for moving forward are:\n\nShift focus from Vertex AI deployment to MVP-defined functionalities.\nComplete Phase 1 Integration (including EventBus) to establish a solid foundation.\nExplicitly reference and prioritize the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT] to guide feature development.\nDefine a clear MVP demonstration scenario to focus our efforts.\nDefer Vertex AI deployment until post-MVP evaluation.\nDoes this revised plan align with your understanding and the objectives outlined in the [MVP_ROLLOUT_PLAN_DOCUMENT]? Please provide any clarifications or adjustments based on the MVP goals and let me know how you'd like to proceed. I'm ready to refine this plan and begin executing the next steps.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
