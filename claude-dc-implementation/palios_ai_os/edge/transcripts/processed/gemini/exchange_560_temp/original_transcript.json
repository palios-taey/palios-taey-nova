    "User: Choose how to control access to objects Prevent public access Restrict data from being publicly accessible via the internet. Will prevent this bucket from being used for web hosting. Learn more  Enforce public access prevention on this bucket Access control Uniform Ensure uniform access to all objects in the bucket by using only bucket-level permissions (IAM). This option becomes permanent after 90 days. Learn more  Fine-grained Specify access to individual objects by using object-level permissions (ACLs) in addition to your bucket-level permissions (IAM). Learn more\n\nGemini: \"Prevent public access\": \u2705 ENABLE \"Prevent public access\" (CHECK THE CHECKBOX)!\n\nYES, you should ABSOLUTELY ENABLE \"Prevent public access\" for your ai-execution-bucket!\nREASON: We do NOT want to make your ai-execution-bucket and its contents publicly accessible on the internet. For security and data privacy, it is essential to restrict public access by default.\nThis setting will prevent accidental or unauthorized public access to your bucket and its objects.\nIt is a BEST PRACTICE to ALWAYS enable \"Prevent public access\" unless you have a specific and intentional reason to make a bucket publicly accessible (e.g., for web hosting, which is NOT our use case).\n\"Access control\": \u2705 SELECT \"Uniform\" (RADIO BUTTON)!\n\nYES, you should SELECT \"Uniform\" access control.\nREASON: \"Uniform access control\" is the RECOMMENDED and SIMPLER access control model for most use cases, including ours.\n\"Uniform\" access control uses only BUCKET-LEVEL PERMISSIONS (IAM) to manage access to ALL OBJECTS within the bucket. This simplifies access management and is generally easier to understand and maintain.\n\"Fine-grained\" access control (using Object-Level ACLs) is typically only needed for very specific and complex access control scenarios where you need to grant different permissions to individual objects within the bucket. For our Vertex AI deployment and general AI Execution System storage needs, \"Uniform access control\" is sufficient and preferred.\n\"Uniform access control\" is also the RECOMMENDED option by Google Cloud for most new buckets.\nIn SUMMARY:\n\nFor your ai-execution-bucket in us-central1, and for the security and manageability of your Vertex AI deployment, the OPTIMAL and RECOMMENDED access control configuration is:\n\n\"Prevent public access\": ENABLED (CHECKED)\n\"Access control\": \"Uniform\" (SELECTED)\nThese settings will ensure that your ai-execution-bucket is PRIVATE and SECURE by default, while still allowing authorized Google Cloud services (like Vertex AI) to access it using IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions at the bucket level. This is exactly what we need for our Vertex AI deployment!\n\nACTION 1.6.47: CONFIGURE BUCKET ACCESS CONTROL - \"PREVENT PUBLIC ACCESS\" and \"UNIFORM\"\n\nPlease configure the \"Choose how to control access to objects\" settings for your new ai-execution-bucket as follows RIGHT NOW:\n\nCHECK the CHECKBOX for \"Enforce public access prevention on this bucket\" (under \"Prevent public access\").\nSELECT the RADIO BUTTON for \"Uniform\" (under \"Access control\").\nAfter configuring these Access Control settings, proceed to the NEXT STEP in the bucket creation process (likely by clicking a \"CONTINUE\" or \"CREATE\" button, depending on the UI flow).\nBy setting these access control options, you are ensuring the security and proper access management for your ai-execution-bucket, which is a crucial step before we retry the Vertex AI Custom Model deployment!\n\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.47 - CONFIGURE BUCKET ACCESS CONTROL RIGHT NOW! Enable \"Prevent public access,\" select \"Uniform,\" and then proceed with bucket creation! Let's get this secure bucket created in us-central1 and resolve that region mismatch error once and for all!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! BUCKET ACCESS CONTROL - CONFIGURED! - \"PREVENT PUBLIC ACCESS\" - ENABLED! - \"UNIFORM\" - SELECTED! - SECURITY - MAXIMIZED! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI - DEPLOYMENT - SECURITY BEST PRACTICES - IMPLEMENTED! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE ACTION 1.6.47 - CONFIGURE ACCESS CONTROL and CREATE BUCKET? LET'S GET THAT SECURE BUCKET CREATED IN us-central1!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
