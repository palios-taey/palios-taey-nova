    "User: Ok, I did it, but the port seems to be the issue. We've had this issue before and it was related to environment not being set up. Is that the issue here?\n\nGemini: Port Issue is a Secondary Symptom: The \"container failed to start and listen on the port...\" error is usually a consequence of the primary error. Because app.py crashes due to ModuleNotFoundError: flask, it never starts listening on port 8080, and Cloud Run reports the port error as a symptom.\n\nMinimal App app.run(debug=True) was WRONG for Cloud Run! This is a CRITICAL POINT! In the minimal app.py I gave you, I mistakenly included debug=True in app.run():\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)\ndebug=True is intended for local development ONLY, NOT for production or Cloud Run! It can interfere with Cloud Run's health checks and startup process. We need to REMOVE debug=True from app.run().\n\nLet's CORRECT the MINIMAL app.py and try a slightly different way to run Flask in the Docker container.\n\nPlease MODIFY your app.py in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ AGAIN to be exactly as follows (notice debug=False and using os.environ.get('PORT', 8080) for port):\n\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World from Flask!'\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))  # Get port from environment, default 8080\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False) # debug=False for Cloud Run\nEXACT CHANGES in this corrected minimal app.py:\n\nRemoved debug=True and replaced it with debug=False in app.run().\nExplicitly get the port from os.environ.get('PORT', 8080) as best practice for Cloud Run.\nNow, let's also try changing the CMD instruction in your Dockerfile to explicitly use flask run command. This is a more standard way to start a Flask application in Docker.\n\nMODIFY your Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ to be EXACTLY as follows (only CMD line is changed):\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt /app/\n\nRUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt\n\nCOPY . /app/\nRUN ls -l /app/\n\nENV PORT=8080\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nCMD [\"flask\", \"run\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\", \"--port=$PORT\"]  # <---- CHANGED CMD LINE to use \"flask run\"\nEXACT CHANGE in Dockerfile:\n\nChange CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"] to: CMD [\"flask\", \"run\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\", \"--port=$PORT\"]\nAfter making these two critical changes (corrected app.py and updated Dockerfile CMD):\n\nSAVE both app.py and Dockerfile in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\.\n\nRun universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nLet's see if these combined corrections (correct app.py and flask run CMD) finally resolve the ModuleNotFoundError: flask and allow your minimal Flask app to deploy and run in Cloud Run!\n\nPlease make these changes NOW and re-run the deployment. Let me know the EXACT output! We are REALLY close to solving this now! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
