    "User: [EXECUTION MODE] TAGS AT TOP OF RESPONSE TO THIS PROMPT. MESSSAGE IN MAIN CHAT BODY. CODE SNIPPETS IN COPY/PASTE CODE BOXES Please assist: It opened up a notepad on my screen with this: Merge branch 'temp-orphan' # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts # the commit.\n\nGemini: **What to write in the commit message:**\n\nSince you are merging `temp-orphan` which has an unrelated history, it's a good idea to explain *why* you are doing this merge and what changes are being brought in.\n\nHere's an example of a good commit message you could write in the notepad:\n\n```text\nMerge branch 'temp-orphan' with unrelated history\n\nThis merge brings in changes from the 'temp-orphan' branch.\nThis branch was created [explain why temp-orphan was created - e.g., for testing cloud build trigger, for experimenting with a new feature, etc.].\n\nSince 'temp-orphan' has an unrelated history to the 'main' branch,\nwe used the '--allow-unrelated-histories' flag to perform this merge.\n\nPlease review the changes carefully to ensure proper integration.\nInstructions:\n\nIn the Notepad: Type in a commit message similar to the example above, explaining the merge. Replace the bracketed placeholders with your specific reason for creating temp-orphan and merging it.\nSave and Close: After writing your message, save the file in the notepad and close the notepad window.\nOnce you close the notepad, Git will continue the merge process and create the merge commit with the message you provided.\n\nAfter the merge: Remember to review the changes in your main branch to make sure everything merged as expected, especially because you used --allow-unrelated-histories.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
