    "User: Yes, it was there. Should I add /.terraform/? I see other folders we excluded have that syntax.\n\nGemini: Run git rm --cached again, but be more specific with the path:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git rm --cached -r deployment/terraform/.terraform\nThis is the same command we used before, but let's just re-run it to be absolutely sure, targeting the specific path again.\n\nImmediately after, run git status again:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git status\nCheck the output of git status carefully. It should NOT list any files in deployment/terraform/.terraform as being tracked or changed. Ideally, it should say \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\" or only show your .gitignore file as being changed (if you haven't already committed it).\n\nTell me what the output of git status is after running git rm --cached again. This is important to diagnose if Git is still seeing those files.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
