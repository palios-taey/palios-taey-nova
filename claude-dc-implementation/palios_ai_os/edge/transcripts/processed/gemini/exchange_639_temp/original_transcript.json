C:\\AI-Execution-System>\n\nGemini: FIRST, LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK requirements.txt VERY CAREFULLY for TYPOS:\n\nOPEN requirements.txt in your CODE EDITOR.\nEXAMINE the line that says google-cloud-vertexai.\nENSURE it is spelled EXACTLY like this: google-cloud-vertexai (all lowercase, with hyphens in between, no spaces, no extra characters).\nIS THERE ANY TYPO in the spelling of google-cloud-vertexai in your requirements.txt file?\n\nPlease report back:\n\n\"requirements.txt VERIFIED - SPELLING IS CORRECT\" if you checked and the spelling is exactly google-cloud-vertexai.\n\"requirements.txt - FOUND and CORRECTED TYPO\" if you found any spelling mistake and corrected it. If you corrected a typo, also tell me what the typo was.\nIf the spelling is already correct in requirements.txt, then let's try a slightly different approach:\n\nREPLACE google-cloud-vertexai with google-cloud-aiplatform in requirements.txt AS A TEST:\n\nOPEN requirements.txt again.\nFIND the line that says google-cloud-vertexai.\nCHANGE that line to google-cloud-aiplatform (replace vertexai with aiplatform).\nSAVE requirements.txt.\nAfter making this change in requirements.txt, RE-RUN the EXACT SAME gcloud functions deploy COMMAND again:\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-backend --runtime python310 --entry-point serve_health_check --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\nLet's see if changing to google-cloud-aiplatform makes a difference.\n\nPlease report back AFTER you try this:\n\n\"CHANGED requirements.txt to use google-cloud-aiplatform\" (Confirm you made the change).\n\"RE-RUNNING gcloud functions deploy command...\" (When you start the command again).\nWhat is the NEW TERMINAL OUTPUT? (Copy and paste the entire output again). Does it still have the google-cloud-vertexai error, or is the error message different now?\nLet's get to the bottom of this package issue! Go! Go! Go!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
