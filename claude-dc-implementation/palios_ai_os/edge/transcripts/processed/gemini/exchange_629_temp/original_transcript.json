Did you forget to import 'http'? C:\\AI-Execution-System>\n\nGemini: Go back to the corrected ai_system.py code I provided and make sure you copied all the lines, especially the import statements at the very beginning.\n\nSpecifically, check that you have these lines at the top of ai_system.py:\n\nimport http.server\nimport socketserver\nfrom http import HTTPStatus\nimport logging  # Import the logging module\n# ... other imports ...\nMake sure import http.server is there. It's essential.\n\nAfter adding the missing import http.server, SAVE ai_system.py and try running python ai_system.py again in cmd.\n\nLet me know if that fixes it!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
