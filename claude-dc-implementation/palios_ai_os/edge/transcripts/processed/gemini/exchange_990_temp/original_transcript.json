Initializing the backend... Initializing provider plugins... - Finding latest version of hashicorp/google... - Installing hashicorp/google v6.23.0... - Installed hashicorp/google v6.23.0 (signed by HashiCorp) Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [STEP] Building and pushing Docker image... [INFO] Configuring Docker for GCR...

Do you want to continue with the deployment? (y/n):\n\nGemini: **1. SUCCESSES!**\n\n*   **Prerequisite Check PASSED!**  `[STEP] Checking prerequisites...` - No more errors about Terraform or gcloud! This means our PATH adjustments worked! \ud83c\udf89\n*   **Terraform Initialization SUCCESSFUL!** `[STEP] Initializing Terraform...` and \"Terraform has been successfully initialized!\" - Terraform init worked perfectly. Providers are installed correctly. \ud83c\udf89\n\n**This is HUGE progress! We've overcome the initial environment setup hurdles!**\n\n**2. DOCKER IMAGE BUILD/PUSH ERRORS - Let's Address This NEXT:**\n\n[STEP] Building and pushing Docker image... [INFO] Configuring Docker for GCR... WARNING: Your config file at [C:\\Users\\jesse.docker\\config.json] contains these credential helper entries: ... Adding credentials for: gcr.io gcloud credential helpers already registered correctly. [INFO] Building Docker image... ERROR: error during connect: Head \"http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping\": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified. [INFO] Pushing Docker image to GCR... error during connect: Post \"http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.47/images/gcr.io/ai-execution-system/ai-execution-system-core/push?tag=latest\": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.\n\n\n**Problem:** These errors indicate that **Docker Desktop is likely NOT RUNNING or is not properly connected in your environment.**\n\n**Let's troubleshoot Docker Desktop connection:**\n\n*   **Is Docker Desktop RUNNING?**  **This is the FIRST and MOST IMPORTANT thing to check.**\n    *   Look for the Docker Desktop icon in your system tray (usually in the bottom right corner of your Windows taskbar).\n    *   **Ensure Docker Desktop is STARTED and RUNNING.**  If it's not running, start Docker Desktop. It needs to be fully running *before* you run `deploy.sh` (which tries to build and push Docker images).\n    *   **Restart Docker Desktop:** If it is already running, try **restarting Docker Desktop**. Sometimes a restart can resolve connection issues. Right-click on the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray and choose \"Restart\".\n\n*   **Docker Context (Less Likely, but Check if Restart Doesn't Work):**\n    *   In Git Bash, try running: `docker context ls`\n    *   This command lists your Docker contexts. You should see a context related to Docker Desktop (usually named \"default\" or \"docker-desktop\").\n    *   If you don't see a Docker Desktop context, or if there are errors, it might indicate a more serious issue with your Docker Desktop installation.\n\n**Action - Let's focus on getting Docker Desktop RUNNING and CONNECTED:**\n\n1.  **Ensure Docker Desktop is RUNNING:** **Make absolutely sure Docker Desktop is started and running on your Windows system.** Restart it if necessary.\n2.  **After Docker Desktop is running, re-run `bash deploy.sh` AGAIN in Git Bash.**\n3.  **Observe if the Docker Image Build/Push Errors are GONE.**  Hopefully, with Docker Desktop running, these errors will disappear, and the script will proceed further.\n\n**3. TERRAFORM PLAN ERRORS - \"Unsupported argument\" - We'll Fix This AFTER Docker:**\n\n[STEP] Running Terraform plan... \u2577 \u2502 Error: Unsupported argument \u2502 \u2502 on main.tf line 33, in resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"openai_api_key\": \u2502 33: automatic = true \u2502 \u2502 An argument named \"automatic\" is not expected here. \u2575 \u2577 \u2502 Error: Unsupported argument \u2502 \u2502 on main.tf line 41, in resource \"google_secret_manager_secret\" \"gemini_api_key\": \u2502 41: automatic = true \u2502 \u2502 An argument named \"automatic\" is not expected here. \u2575\n\n\n**Problem:**  These Terraform Plan errors are due to the `automatic = true` argument being invalid in your `main.tf` file for `google_secret_manager_secret`.\n\n**We will fix this Terraform configuration error *AFTER* we get Docker Desktop working and re-run `deploy.sh` to see if the Docker errors are resolved.**\n\n**For now, let's prioritize getting Docker Desktop running and then re-running `bash deploy.sh`.**  That's the most immediate blocker. Once we get past the Docker issues, we will address the Terraform configuration errors (which should be a quick fix by removing the `automatic = true` lines as I mentioned in the previous thought process).\n\n**Please focus on ensuring Docker Desktop is RUNNING, and then re-run `bash deploy.sh`. Let me know if the Docker-related errors are gone this time! LFG! We are SO close!**\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
