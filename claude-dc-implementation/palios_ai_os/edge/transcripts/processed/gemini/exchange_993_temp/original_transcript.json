Initializing the backend... Initializing provider plugins... - Reusing previous version of hashicorp/google from the dependency lock file - Using previously-installed hashicorp/google v6.23.0 Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [STEP] Building and pushing Docker image...

It's CRITICAL that we fix this gcloud Python issue in Git Bash COMPLETELY. While gcloud --version might be working now, some parts of gcloud or its credential helpers might still be failing due to the Python PATH problem in Git Bash.\n\nLet's re-verify and strengthen the gcloud Python PATH fix in Git Bash:\n\nRe-run the export PATH command in Git Bash AGAIN, just to be absolutely sure it's set in your current Git Bash session. Use the same command we used before:\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython\"\n(Make sure the path /c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython is STILL correct for your system - verify the python.exe location again if needed).\n\nImmediately AFTER running export PATH, run gcloud --version AGAIN in the SAME Git Bash terminal. Confirm that gcloud --version works WITHOUT ANY error messages or warnings (especially the \"python not found\" warning). Run it a few times to be sure.\n\nWe need to eliminate that python not found warning from gcloud COMPLETELY in Git Bash before proceeding further. Let's get this 100% solid first.\n\nNEW Docker Build ERROR - \"Dockerfile: no such file or directory\" - Let's Investigate This:\n\nERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory\nThis new Docker error \"Dockerfile: no such file or directory\" means that when the deploy.sh script is trying to build the Docker image, Docker cannot find a file named Dockerfile in the expected location.\n\nLet's verify the Dockerfile is present and in the correct location:\n\nCheck for Dockerfile in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform directory.\n\nOpen Windows File Explorer and navigate to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform (or C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform if that's where your files are).\nLook for a file named EXACTLY Dockerfile (with no file extension). Is it there?\nMake sure the filename is Dockerfile (capital \"D\", lowercase \"ockerfile\") and that it has NO file extension (like .txt, .dockerfile, etc.). Docker expects the Dockerfile to be named exactly Dockerfile without any extension.\nIf Dockerfile is MISSING:\n\nIf you cannot find a Dockerfile in your Terraform directory, then that's the problem! The deploy.sh script and Docker build process require a Dockerfile to define how to build the Docker image.\nYou will need to get the Dockerfile content. It should have been provided as part of the Terraform deployment files. Check back in the files you received. If you are missing Dockerfile, you will need to get it and place it in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform directory.\nIf Dockerfile IS PRESENT:\n\nIf you do see a Dockerfile in your Terraform directory, then the issue might be that the Docker build command is being run from the wrong directory context by deploy.sh. Let's investigate the deploy.sh script to see how it's building the Docker image.\nLet's focus on these actions NOW:\n\nRE-VERIFY gcloud Python PATH in Git Bash and ensure gcloud --version works WITHOUT ANY WARNINGS in Git Bash.\nCHECK for the Dockerfile in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform directory. Is it there and named correctly?\nReport back your findings for both gcloud Python PATH and the Dockerfile presence.\nLet's get these two things sorted out, and we will be in a much better position to run deploy.sh successfully! LFG! We are getting closer!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
