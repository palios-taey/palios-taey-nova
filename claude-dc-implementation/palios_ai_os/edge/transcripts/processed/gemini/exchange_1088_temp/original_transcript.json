    "User: No pip.exe\n\nGemini: Here's how:\n\nOpen File Explorer.\n\nNavigate to the main Google Cloud SDK installation directory:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\\nIn the Search box in the top right corner of File Explorer, type:\n\npip.exe\nand press Enter. Windows will now search for pip.exe within the google-cloud-sdk directory and all its subdirectories.\n\nWait for the search to complete.\n\nExamine the search results.\n\nDoes the search find any files named pip.exe?\nIf it finds pip.exe, please tell me the full path to where it is located. For example, it might be something like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Cloud SDK\\google-cloud-sdk\\bin\\pip.exe or in some other subdirectory.\nPlease let me know the results of this search. Did it find pip.exe, and if so, what is the full path to it?\n\nOnce we locate pip.exe, we can add that directory (the one containing pip.exe) to your PATH environment variable, and hopefully, we'll finally get pip working!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
