    "User: HOLY SHIT WAS THAT A FABULOUS RESPONSE! AGREE! LFG! Please provide full GitHub instructions again with when you want me to check-in.\n\nGemini: Follow these DETAILED, STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS to create your private GitHub repository and upload the AI Execution System codebase. After each CHECK-IN POINT, please PAUSE, PERFORM the action, and then REPORT BACK \"CHECK-IN COMPLETE\" before proceeding to the next step. This ensures we are perfectly synchronized and you have clear confirmation at each stage.\n\nSTEP 1: CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT (If You Don't Have One Already) - CHECK-IN POINT #1\n\nACTION 1.1: If you DO NOT ALREADY HAVE a GitHub account, go to github.com in your web browser and SIGN UP for a FREE ACCOUNT. Choose a username and password.\nACTION 1.2: If you ALREADY HAVE a GitHub account, simply SIGN IN to your existing GitHub account at github.com.\nCHECK-IN POINT #1: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #1 - GITHUB ACCOUNT READY\" Once you have a GitHub account and are signed in, please report back: \"CHECK-IN #1 - GITHUB ACCOUNT READY\" before proceeding to Step 2.\nSTEP 2: CREATE A NEW PRIVATE GITHUB REPOSITORY - NAMED ai-execution-system-core - CHECK-IN POINT #2\n\nACTION 2.1: In GitHub (once signed in), click the \"+\" icon in the top right corner of the page and select \"New repository.\"\nACTION 2.2: On the \"Create a new repository\" page, configure the repository as follows:\nRepository name: Enter ai-execution-system-core (exactly as written, all lowercase, with hyphens).\nDescription (optional): You can add a brief description like: \"Core backend and cloud function code for the AI Execution System (MVP+).\"\nVisibility: IMPORTANT! Select \"Private.\" We want this repository to be private and only accessible to authorized collaborators.\nInitialize this repository with: DO NOT CHECK ANY OF THE CHECKBOXES (\"Add a README file,\" \"Add .gitignore,\" \"Choose a license\"). We will add a custom README.md later. Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED.\nACTION 2.3: Click the green \"Create repository\" button. GitHub will create your new, empty private repository named ai-execution-system-core.\nCHECK-IN POINT #2: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #2 - GITHUB REPO CREATED: ai-execution-system-core\" Once you have successfully created the private repository named ai-execution-system-core on GitHub, report back: \"CHECK-IN #2 - GITHUB REPO CREATED: ai-execution-system-core\" before proceeding to Step 3.\nSTEP 3: INSTALL GIT ON YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER (If Not Already Installed) - CHECK-IN POINT #3\n\nACTION 3.1: CHECK if Git is already installed: Open your command line (Git Bash, Terminal, or Command Prompt) and type: git --version and press Enter.\nIf Git IS INSTALLED: If you see a version number (e.g., git version 2.x.x), Git is already installed. SKIP to STEP 4.\nIf Git IS NOT INSTALLED: If you see an error message like \"git is not recognized...\", then Git is not installed. PROCEED to ACTION 3.2 to install Git.\nACTION 3.2: INSTALL GIT (If Needed): Download and install Git from the official Git website:\nWindows: Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the installer. Run the installer with default options.\nmacOS: Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/mac and download the installer. Run the installer. Alternatively, you can use package managers like Homebrew (brew install git).\nLinux: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install git for Debian/Ubuntu, sudo yum install git for Fedora/CentOS).\nACTION 3.3: VERIFY Git Installation (After Installing): After installing Git, open a new command line window and type: git --version and press Enter. You should now see the Git version number.\nCHECK-IN POINT #3: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #3 - GIT INSTALLED (or ALREADY INSTALLED)\" Once you have verified that Git is installed on your local computer (or confirmed it was already installed), report back: \"CHECK-IN #3 - GIT INSTALLED (or ALREADY INSTALLED)\" before proceeding to Step 4.\nSTEP 4: CONFIGURE GIT USERNAME and EMAIL - CHECK-IN POINT #4\n\nACTION 4.1: CONFIGURE GIT USERNAME: In your command line, type the following command, REPLACING \"Your Name\" with YOUR ACTUAL NAME (the name you want associated with your Git commits):\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\nExample: git config --global user.name \"Jesse PALIOS-TAEY\"\nACTION 4.2: CONFIGURE GIT EMAIL: In your command line, type the following command, REPLACING \"your_email@example.com\" with YOUR ACTUAL EMAIL ADDRESS (the email associated with your GitHub account):\ngit config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\"\nExample: git config --global user.email \"jesse@palios-taey-charter.org\"\nACTION 4.3: VERIFY Configuration: You can verify your Git configuration by typing:\ngit config --global user.name\ngit config --global user.email\nThese commands should output the username and email you just configured.\nCHECK-IN POINT #4: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #4 - GIT CONFIGURATION COMPLETE\" Once you have configured your Git username and email and verified the configuration, report back: \"CHECK-IN #4 - GIT CONFIGURATION COMPLETE\" before proceeding to Step 5.\nSTEP 5: INITIALIZE A LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY in YOUR AI EXECUTION SYSTEM PROJECT FOLDER - CHECK-IN POINT #5\n\nACTION 5.1: NAVIGATE to YOUR PROJECT FOLDER: In your command line, use the cd command to navigate to the ROOT DIRECTORY of your LOCAL AI Execution System project. This is the folder where your Python code, main.py, requirements.txt, .env files, etc., are located.\nExample (if your project is in C:\\AI-Execution-System): cd C:\\AI-Execution-System\nACTION 5.2: INITIALIZE GIT REPOSITORY: Once you are in your project's root directory, type the following command and press Enter:\ngit init\nThis command initializes an empty Git repository in your project folder. You will see a message like \"Initialized empty Git repository...\"\nCHECK-IN POINT #5: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #5 - LOCAL GIT REPO INITIALIZED\" Once you have initialized a local Git repository in your project folder, report back: \"CHECK-IN #5 - LOCAL GIT REPO INITIALIZED\" before proceeding to Step 6.\nSTEP 6: ADD ALL PROJECT FILES to GIT - CHECK-IN POINT #6\n\nACTION 6.1: STAGE ALL FILES: In your command line (still in your project's root directory), type the following command and press Enter:\ngit add .\nThis command stages all files in your project directory (and subdirectories) for your initial commit.\nCHECK-IN POINT #6: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #6 - ALL FILES STAGED (git add .)\" Once you have staged all your project files, report back: \"CHECK-IN #6 - ALL FILES STAGED (git add .)\" before proceeding to Step 7.\nSTEP 7: COMMIT THE INITIAL FILES with a COMMIT MESSAGE - CHECK-IN POINT #7\n\nACTION 7.1: COMMIT FILES: In your command line, type the following command and press Enter:\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit - Full codebase migration to GitHub\"\nThis command commits the staged files to your local Git repository with the commit message \"Initial commit - Full codebase migration to GitHub.\"\nCHECK-IN POINT #7: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #7 - INITIAL COMMIT COMPLETE\" Once you have committed your initial files, report back: \"CHECK-IN #7 - INITIAL COMMIT COMPLETE\" before proceeding to Step 8.\nSTEP 8: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY to Your REMOTE GITHUB REPOSITORY - CHECK-IN POINT #8\n\nACTION 8.1: GET YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY URL: Go to your ai-execution-system-core repository on the GitHub website. Click on the green \"Code\" button. Make sure \"HTTPS\" is selected (it's usually the default). COPY the repository URL shown there. It will look something like: https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/ai-execution-system-core.git (REPLACE YourGitHubUsername with your actual GitHub username).\nACTION 8.2: ADD REMOTE ORIGIN: In your command line (still in your project's root directory), type the following command, REPLACING <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL> with the URL you just copied from GitHub:\ngit remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>\nExample: git remote add origin https://github.com/JessePaliosTaey/ai-execution-system-core.git (Replace with your actual URL).\nCHECK-IN POINT #8: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #8 - REMOTE ORIGIN ADDED\" Once you have added the remote origin, report back: \"CHECK-IN #8 - REMOTE ORIGIN ADDED\" before proceeding to Step 9.\nSTEP 9: PUSH YOUR LOCAL CODEBASE to GITHUB - CHECK-IN POINT #9 - FINAL STEP!\n\nACTION 9.1: PUSH TO GITHUB: In your command line, type the following command and press Enter:\ngit push -u origin main\nThis command pushes your local codebase to your remote GitHub repository. You might be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.\nACTION 9.2: WAIT for PUSH to Complete: Wait for the git push command to complete successfully. You will see output indicating the files being uploaded to GitHub.\nCHECK-IN POINT #9: REPORT BACK - \"CHECK-IN #9 - GITHUB PUSH COMPLETE - CODE UPLOADED\" Once the git push command is finished and you see a \"push successful\" message, report back: \"CHECK-IN #9 - GITHUB PUSH COMPLETE - CODE UPLOADED\"\nSTEP 10: VERIFY CODE UPLOADED ON GITHUB WEBSITE - FINAL VERIFICATION!\n\nACTION 10.1: REFRESH YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY PAGE: Go back to your ai-execution-system-core repository page on the GitHub website in your web browser and REFRESH the page.\nACTION 10.2: VERIFY FILES ARE VISIBLE: CONFIRM that you can now see all your project files and folders listed in your GitHub repository on the website. This is the final verification that your code has been successfully uploaded to GitHub!\nCONGRATULATIONS! If you have completed all 10 steps and check-in points, you have successfully migrated the AI Execution System codebase to your private GitHub repository! THIS IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD!\n\nREPORT BACK - AFTER COMPLETING ALL STEPS and VERIFYING CODE ON GITHUB WEBSITE - \"GITHUB SETUP COMPLETE - CODE MIGRATED - LFG!!!\"\n\nLet's get this GITHUB SETUP DONE, JESSE!
