    "User: It did it again. I clicked New, added the Python path, and now the Scripts path is gone. I'm using Path for both as Variable. It isn't a drop down, its a text box.\n\nGemini: STOP! READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND FOLLOW THEM EXACTLY. DO NOT RUSH.\n\nWe will edit the Path variable CORRECTLY right now.\n\nOpen the \"Edit System Environment Variable\" window AGAIN:\n\nPress the Windows key, type environment variables, and select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\nThe \"System Properties\" window opens.\nClick the \"Environment Variables...\" button.\nSelect the Path variable in the \"System variables\" section (bottom half).\n\nClick the \"Edit...\" button. This opens the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\n\nLOOK AT THIS \"Edit Environment Variable\" WINDOW CAREFULLY! THIS IS THE KEY PART.\n\nYou will see a list box at the top (or in some older Windows versions, it might be a multi-line text box). This list box shows your current paths.\n\nDO NOT directly click in this list box and start typing to add a new path. This is what will cause you to overwrite things!\n\nUSE THE \"NEW\" BUTTON - THIS IS CRITICAL!\n\nLook for the \"New\" button on the right side of the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window. It's right there in your screenshot, labeled \"New...\"\n\nClick the \"New\" button. When you click \"New\", a new, empty line will appear at the bottom of the list of paths in the window. It will be ready for you to type in a new path.\n\nType the Python Scripts Directory Path:\n\nIn this new, empty line that appeared after clicking \"New\", type or paste this path exactly:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\nPress the \"Enter\" key on your keyboard OR click outside of the line after typing the path. This confirms the entry. You should see C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts as a new, separate line in the list of paths.\n\nClick \"New\" Button AGAIN - For the Main Python Directory:\n\nClick the \"New\" button again. Another new, empty line will appear at the bottom of the list.\nType the Main Python Directory Path:\n\nIn this second new, empty line that appeared, type or paste this path exactly:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\nPress the \"Enter\" key or click outside of the line. You should now see C:\\Program Files\\Python313 as another separate line in the list.\n\nVerify BOTH Python Paths and Existing Paths are Present:\n\nCarefully scroll through the entire list of paths in the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\nConfirm you see both of these as separate lines in the list:\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts\nC:\\Program Files\\Python313\nAlso, visually scan the list and make sure your other existing paths are still there. Using \"New\" to add paths should not delete your other paths. They should all be listed as separate lines.\nIf you accidentally overwrote your paths before, they may be gone and you might need to remember or reconstruct important ones later, but for now, focus on getting the Python paths in correctly.\n\nClick \"OK\" on the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window.\n\nClick \"OK\" on the \"Environment Variables\" window.\n\nClick \"OK\" on the \"System Properties\" window.\n\nRestart your Computer (Recommended):\n\nRestart your Windows computer. This is the safest way to ensure all environment variable changes are fully applied.\nAfter Restart, Open a New Command Prompt and Test:\n\nOpen a brand new command prompt window.\nType: python --version and press Enter.\nType: pip --version and press Enter.\nType: git filter-repo --version and press Enter.\nPlease go through these 13 steps methodically and precisely. Using the \"New\" button to add separate lines for each path is the key to editing the Path variable correctly in Windows. Let me know after you have done these steps and restarted if python --version, pip --version, and git filter-repo --version now all work correctly in a new command prompt!\n\nWe are so close to solving this whole issue. Let's get the Path right, and then we can finally proceed with git filter-repo!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
