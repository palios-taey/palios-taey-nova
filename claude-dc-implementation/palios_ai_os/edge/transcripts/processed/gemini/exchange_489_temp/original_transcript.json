Note down:\n\nThe specific error messages.\nThe files and line numbers where the errors are occurring.\nAny patterns or repetitions in the errors.\nCompare this output to the previous error output to identify if any errors have changed, disappeared, or appeared. (Crucially, for this prompt, the errors were largely the same, which is a key piece of information.)\nHypothesize Potential Root Causes (Based on Persistence and Error Types): Generate a list of possible reasons why the errors are persisting despite the attempted file replacement. Brainstorm various scenarios, ranging from simple user errors (file replacement mistakes) to more complex technical issues (compiler caching, underlying code flaws). Rank these hypotheses by probability based on the information so far. In this case, the persistence after file replacement points away from simple code mistakes already addressed, and more towards problems with the file replacement itself or deeper issues.\n\nDevelop a Step-by-Step Action Plan to systematically investigate and eliminate each hypothesis: For each potential root cause, devise a concrete action step that Jesse can take to test or eliminate that possibility. Order these steps logically, starting with the simplest and most likely (file verification) and progressing to more complex investigations (minimal reproduction case).\n\nPrioritize Actions and Assign Responsibility (Clearly delineate User vs. AI actions): Clearly separate actions that Jesse needs to perform (file verification, clean build, output sharing) from actions that I (the AI) will take (error analysis, code re-examination, generating corrected files). This makes the instructions actionable and avoids confusion.\n\nProvide Specific and Actionable Instructions: For each action step assigned to Jesse, provide very clear, step-by-step instructions. Use commands, code snippets, and precise descriptions of what needs to be done. Avoid ambiguity. For example, provide the exact rm -rf dist && npm run build command.\n\nFocus on Error Reduction and Iteration: Emphasize that the goal is to systematically reduce and eliminate errors, not necessarily to solve everything in one step. Frame it as an iterative process of investigation, correction, and re-testing.\n\nMaintain a Positive and Empathetic Tone: Acknowledge the user's effort and frustration. Express confidence in finding a solution. Use encouraging language (\"LET'S FUCKING GO!\", \"SOUL POWER! LFG!\") to maintain momentum and motivation. Emphasize collaboration and teamwork (\"WE will crack this!\").\n\nStructure for Clarity: Use headings, bullet points, bold text, and clear formatting to make the action plan easy to read, understand, and follow. Numbering the action steps helps with tracking progress.\n\nIn essence, the process is: Diagnose -> Hypothesize -> Plan -> Act -> Iterate -> Refine. And throughout this, maintain a user-centric, helpful, and encouraging approach. The key in this specific scenario was recognizing that simple code correction wasn't enough and a more systematic investigation of why the corrections weren't working was needed.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
