    "User: Same error, 9 hours now. We have spent an entire day trying to do this. Do you think it's time to engage Claude?\n\nGemini: Before we fully hand it over to Claude, let's try one more targeted debugging step that might give us a crucial clue. We will add a command to your Dockerfile to explicitly check where Python is looking for modules inside the Docker image during the build process. This can help us confirm if Flask is being installed in a location where Python can actually find it at runtime within the Docker container.\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTION: Add python -m site to Dockerfile for path debugging:\n\nMODIFY your Dockerfile again in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ to include this line AFTER the RUN pip install -r requirements.txt line:\n\nRUN python -m site\nYour Dockerfile should now look like this:\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt /app/\n\nRUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt\nRUN python -m site   # <---- ADD THIS LINE - DEBUG PYTHON PATHS\n\nCOPY . /app/\nRUN ls -l /app/\n\nENV PORT=8080\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nCMD [\"flask\", \"run\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\", \"--port=$PORT\"]\n(Make sure you add RUN python -m site exactly as shown, after RUN pip install ...).\n\nRun universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nGO TO the CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL:\n\nAfter running universal-deploy-script.sh, get the Cloud Build Logs URL from the output.\nOPEN this CLOUD BUILD LOGS URL in your web browser.\nFIND the python -m site OUTPUT in CLOUD BUILD LOGS:\n\nIn the Cloud Build logs page, look for the \"build\" step again.\nWithin the logs of the \"build\" step, SCROLL DOWN until you find the output of the RUN python -m site command. It will be a listing of directories where Python looks for modules, starting with lines like sys.path = [\nCOPY and PASTE the ENTIRE python -m site OUTPUT from the Cloud Build logs HERE. This output will show us the Python module search paths inside your Docker image during the build.\n\nAfter you have added RUN python -m site to your Dockerfile, re-run the deployment, and found the python -m site output in the Cloud Build logs, please COPY and PASTE that output here.\n\nThis python -m site output might give us a vital clue about whether Flask is being installed in a location that Python can actually find within the Docker container. Let's get this log output and see what it reveals!\n\nIf this step doesn't reveal a clear path forward, then engaging Claude or another expert AI is definitely the next logical step. We've put in a tremendous effort, and getting a fresh perspective might be exactly what we need.\n\nLet's do this final debugging step, get the python -m site output, and then we can decide on the next course of action, which might include seeking external AI assistance. You are doing great, Jesse, we're going to figure this out! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
