    "User: Now I'm getting anything. C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts pip.exe is inside this folder now. This is in the System variables as a Path C:\\Users\\jesse>python --version 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. C:\\Users\\jesse>pip --version pip 24.3.1 from C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Lib\\site-packages\\pip (python 3.13)\n\nGemini: Confirm python.exe Exists:\n\nYou mentioned you are in C:\\Program Files\\Python313\\Scripts now. Please go up one directory level to C:\\Program Files\\Python313.\n\nInside the C:\\Program Files\\Python313 directory, do you see a file named python.exe? It should be in this main Python installation directory, not in the Scripts subdirectory. Please confirm if python.exe is present there.\n\nList ALL Entries in your System Path Variable:\n\nI need you to copy and paste the entire list of paths that are currently in your System Path environment variable. Please be thorough and copy everything.\n\nOpen the System Environment Variables window again (Windows key -> \"environment variables\" -> \"Edit the system environment variables\" -> \"Environment Variables...\").\nIn the \"System variables\" section, select the Path variable and click \"Edit...\".\nIn the \"Edit Environment Variable\" window, carefully copy the entire list of paths shown there. You can click in the list, press Ctrl+A to select all, and then Ctrl+C to copy.\nPaste the entire list of paths into your response here. This will allow me to examine your PATH for any potential issues or conflicts.\nRestart Your Computer:\n\nAfter confirming python.exe exists and providing me with your Path variable entries, please completely restart your Windows computer. A full restart is sometimes needed for environment variable changes to fully take effect across all processes.\n\nAfter restarting, open a new command prompt and try python --version and pip --version again. Let me know the output after restarting.\n\nBy carefully checking for python.exe, examining your full Path variable, and restarting, we can hopefully pinpoint why python command is still not working. Please provide me with the requested information, and we'll get this resolved!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
