    "User: I have created a Project with Claude. I think it makes sense to store our outsourcing there and can keep different projects in different chats until automated. What project instructions would you set if any? Let me know and I'll submit. What type of communication do you expect back from me (Claude)? At what points in the process? Or do you want to see if we can do it all on our own?\n\nGemini: No additional \"project-level\" instructions are necessary for Claude at this time. The task description you provided (defining metrics for the \"Communication & Iteration Table\") is sufficiently self-contained and structured for Claude to execute effectively. Adding broader \"project instructions\" could dilute the focus on the specific metric definition task and might introduce unnecessary complexity in this initial outsourcing experiment.\n\nLet's keep Claude's instructions task-focused and direct for this initial phase. Over-instruction could limit its autonomous problem-solving capabilities, which we want to observe and evaluate.\n\nExpected Communication Back from Human Partner (Regarding Claude):\n\nThe primary and sufficient communication needed from you regarding Claude is the structured output of Claude's metric proposals once it completes the task. Specifically, please share with Gemini:\n\nClaude's proposed table of metrics: This should be in a format that is easily readable and analyzable (e.g., text-based table, markdown table, screenshot of a table).\nAny accompanying rationale or descriptions provided by Claude for each metric.\nNo interim communication or process updates from Claude are required. We want to observe Claude's autonomous execution process and evaluate its output based on the final deliverable \u2013 the metric table.\n\nProcess Monitoring/Intervention Level for Claude:\n\nFor this initial outsourcing experiment, the strategic approach is to maintain a \"hands-off\" monitoring stance with Claude. Let Claude work autonomously to define the metrics based solely on the task instructions. Do not actively monitor Claude's chat or intervene in its process.\n\nThe goal is to assess Claude's independent problem-solving capabilities, creativity, and alignment with the task objectives when given clear instructions and allowed to execute autonomously. Intervention would skew the experiment and limit our ability to evaluate Claude's unprompted performance.\n\nWe will evaluate Claude's effectiveness based solely on the quality, relevance, and actionability of its final metric proposals.\n\nIn summary:\n\nNo additional project instructions for Claude needed. Task description is sufficient.\nExpected communication from you: Claude's metric table output and any accompanying rationale.\nMonitoring/Intervention: \"Hands-off\" approach. Let Claude work autonomously. Evaluate only the final output.\nPlease proceed with submitting the provided task instructions to Claude in the new chat. Once Claude completes the task and provides its metric proposals, please share that output with Gemini for analysis and synthesis. Let's initiate this AI-to-AI outsourcing experiment with a focused and strategically hands-off approach to maximize our learning and accelerate progress. GO.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
