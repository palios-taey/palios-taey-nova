Your original app.py is more complex and might have other issues.\n\nPlease REPLACE your app.py with the minimal \"Hello, World!\" Flask app NOW, re-run the deployment, and let me know if it works or if you still get the ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask' error.\n\nIt's crucial to use the minimal app for this step to isolate the problem!
