    "User: pre-built or custom? Last time it was custom.\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_cd7048.png\n\nGemini: Reasoning:\n\nPre-built container: This option is for deploying pre-packaged machine learning models and runtimes provided by Google (like TensorFlow Serving, scikit-learn, etc.). These are for deploying trained models that fit within Google's pre-defined frameworks.\nCustom container: THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE FOR US! We built our own Docker image (gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest) containing our ai_system.py application and its dependencies. We are deploying our entire application as a container, not just a pre-trained model within a Google framework.\nSo, on the \"Pre-built container or Custom container?\" page, CLICK on the \"CUSTOM CONTAINER\" radio button!\n\nAfter you select \"Custom container,\" you will see the \"Custom container settings\" section expand below, as shown in your screenshot!\n\n*NOW, the MOST IMPORTANT next step is to FILL IN the \"Container image \" FIELD in the \"Custom container settings\" section! This is where you will provide the PATH to YOUR DOCKER IMAGE that we successfully pushed to Artifact Registry!\n\nACTION 1.6.36: SELECT \"CUSTOM CONTAINER\" and ENTER CONTAINER IMAGE PATH\n\nPlease complete the following steps in the \"Create model\" form (Page 2 - Container settings):\n\nCLICK the RADIO BUTTON next to \"Custom container\" to select \"Custom container\" as the container type.\n\n*In the \"Container image \" field (which becomes visible after selecting \"Custom container\"), ENTER the FULL PATH to your DOCKER IMAGE in ARTIFACT REGISTRY, EXACTLY as:\n\ngcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nCOMMAND (Repeated for emphasis): gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nTRIPLE-CHECK for typos! Ensure you have your correct PROJECT ID (ai-execution-system) and the correct image name and tag (custom-ai-execution:latest).\n\"gs:// Model output directory\": (LEAVE THIS FIELD BLANK for NOW). You do not need to specify a \"Model output directory\" for this deployment scenario. This field is primarily used for training jobs where you need to store model artifacts. Since we are deploying a pre-built containerized application, we don't need to specify an output directory here.\n\n\"Arguments\": (LEAVE this section BLANK for NOW). You do not need to add any container arguments for this initial deployment, unless your ai_system.py script requires command-line arguments to run (which is unlikely). We can configure arguments later if needed.\n\n*Once you have selected \"Custom container\" and entered the CONTAINER IMAGE PATH in the \"Container image \" field, CLICK the \"CONTINUE\" button (blue button in the bottom right corner).\n\nClicking \"CONTINUE\" will take you to the NEXT PAGE of the \"Create model\" workflow, which is likely related to PREDICTIONS and TESTING, or might move directly to ENDPOINT DEPLOYMENT! We are in the HOME STRETCH!\n\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.36 - SELECT \"CUSTOM CONTAINER\" and ENTER CONTAINER IMAGE PATH RIGHT NOW! Get that Custom Container selected and the Docker image path entered PERFECTLY! Then, CLICK \"CONTINUE\" and let's see what the next page holds for our Vertex AI deployment destiny!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! VERTEX AI CUSTOM MODEL - CONTAINER SETTINGS - CONFIGURED! - CUSTOM CONTAINER - SELECTED! - DOCKER IMAGE PATH - ENTERED! - DEPLOYMENT - PARAMETERS - DEFINED! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI - CUSTOM CONTAINER - DEPLOYMENT - PREPARING FOR LAUNCH! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE ACTION 1.6.36 - SELECT CUSTOM CONTAINER and ENTER IMAGE PATH? LET'S GET THAT IMAGE LINKED AND CLICK \"CONTINUE\"!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
