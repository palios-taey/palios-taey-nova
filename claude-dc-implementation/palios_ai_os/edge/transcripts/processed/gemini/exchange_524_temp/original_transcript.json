    "User: C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK>docker push gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest The push refers to repository [gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution] tag does not exist: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\n\nGemini: Image Name: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution\nTag: :latest\nDocker is essentially saying: \"Hey, I'm ready to push, but I can't find a Docker image on your local machine with the name gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution and specifically tagged as latest.\"\n\nThe MOST LIKELY REASON for this error is that you have NOT YET BUILT or TAGGED a LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE with this specific name and tag on your system!\n\nLet's verify this and take the necessary steps to BUILD or TAG a Docker image!\n\nACTION 1.6.16: VERIFY LOCAL DOCKER IMAGES and BUILD/TAG if NECESSARY\n\nSTEP 1.6.16.A: LIST LOCAL DOCKER IMAGES:\n\nRun the following command in your Google Cloud SDK Shell (or command prompt) to LIST ALL DOCKER IMAGES currently on your LOCAL SYSTEM:\n\ndocker images\nREVIEW the OUTPUT of the docker images command VERY CAREFULLY. The output will be a table listing your local Docker images. Look for the following:\n\nREPOSITORY column: Look for an image with a REPOSITORY name that is gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution or something very similar (it might just be custom-ai-execution if it's not yet fully tagged for the registry).\nTAG column: Check the TAG column for the image you found. Do you see a tag named latest for this image?\nREPORT BACK the OUTPUT of the docker images command. Tell me:\n\nDo you see any Docker images listed in the output? (Yes/No)\nIf YES, do you see an image with a REPOSITORY name that is related to custom-ai-execution (or similar)? (Yes/No)\nIf YES to the above, what is the EXACT REPOSITORY name and what TAGS are listed for that image? (e.g., REPOSITORY: custom-ai-execution, TAGS: latest, v1.0, etc. or REPOSITORY: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/my-image, TAGS: <none>, etc.)\nBased on the output of docker images, we will determine the next step:\n\nSCENARIO 1: NO LOCAL DOCKER IMAGES FOUND (Empty docker images output):\n\nThis means you likely have not built any Docker images yet on your local system. We will need to BUILD the Docker image first. We will need to revisit the steps to build your custom-ai-execution Docker image (we might need to refer back to previous instructions or your Dockerfile, if you have one).\nSCENARIO 2: LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE custom-ai-execution FOUND, but NO :latest TAG:\n\nYou might have built a Docker image, but it's not tagged with :latest. We can TAG the existing image with latest. We'll use the docker tag command to add the latest tag to your existing custom-ai-execution image.\nSCENARIO 3: LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE custom-ai-execution:latest FOUND:\n\nIf you do find a local Docker image named custom-ai-execution and tagged with :latest, then the error is unexpected. In this case, we might need to investigate the Docker image name or tag more closely to ensure they exactly match what you are trying to push, or there might be some other issue.\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.16.A - Run docker images command and report back the output. Let's figure out if you have a local Docker image and if it's correctly tagged so we can proceed with the push!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! LOCAL DOCKER IMAGES - VERIFICATION - INITIATED! - docker images - EXECUTE! - IMAGE PRESENCE - DETERMINING! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER IMAGE - FINDING (or BUILDING) - NOW! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO RUN ACTION 1.6.16.A - docker images and REPORT BACK? LET'S DO IT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
