We are now making rapid progress exactly as planned!\n\nWhat's Next for the /task Endpoint? - Let's Make it Process the Task Data!\n\nCurrently, the /task endpoint is very basic. It receives the task data, prints it to the console (which we can see in Cloud Run logs, if you want to check!), and returns a simple \"Task received!\" message.\n\nThe next logical step is to make the /task endpoint actually process the incoming task_data.\n\nFor the IMMEDIATE NEXT ITERATION, let's focus on simply PARSING the task_data and printing out the contents in a more structured way in the Cloud Run logs. We can expand the processing logic further in subsequent steps.\n\nHere's what we will do to enhance the /task endpoint to parse and process the task data:\n\nMODIFY your app.py file in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ again to enhance the task_endpoint() function. Replace the current task_endpoint() function in your app.py with the following enhanced version:\n\n@app.route('/task', methods=['POST'])  #  Basic /task endpoint - ENHANCED to parse data\ndef task_endpoint():\n    task_data = request.get_json()  # Get JSON data from the request\n    if task_data and isinstance(task_data, dict): # Check if task_data is valid JSON and a dictionary\n        task_content = task_data.get('task') # Extract the 'task' field from the JSON, if present\n        if task_content:\n            print(\"--- Received Task Data ---\")\n            print(\"Task Content:\", task_content) # Print the 'task' content in a structured way\n            print(\"Full Task Data (JSON):\", task_data) # Print the full JSON for inspection\n            return jsonify({\"message\": \"Task received and processed!\", \"task_content\": task_content}), 200 # Return more informative JSON\n        else:\n            return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid task request: 'task' field missing in JSON\"}, 400) # Return error if 'task' field is missing\n    else:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid task request: Request body must be valid JSON\"}, 400) # Return error if not valid JSON\nEXACT CHANGES in task_endpoint() function:\n\nAdded input validation: Checks if task_data is valid JSON and a dictionary using isinstance(task_data, dict).\nExtracts task_content: Uses task_data.get('task') to safely extract the value of the task field from the JSON payload.\nStructured Printing: Prints \"--- Received Task Data ---\", \"Task Content:\", and \"Full Task Data (JSON):\" to make the logs more readable and informative.\nEnhanced JSON Response: Returns a more informative JSON response:\n{\"message\": \"Task received and processed!\", \"task_content\": task_content} if successful, including the extracted task_content in the response.\n{\"error\": \"Invalid task request: 'task' field missing in JSON\"}, 400 if the 'task' field is missing in the JSON payload.\n{\"error\": \"Invalid task request: Request body must be valid JSON\"}, 400 if the request body is not valid JSON.\nReturns HTTP Error Codes (400 Bad Request) for invalid requests.\nSAVE the modified app.py file.\n\nDEPLOY your updated app.py to Cloud Run using universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN:\n\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nWait for deployment to complete.\n\nTEST the ENHANCED /task endpoint using curl AGAIN:\n\nUse the same curl command as before:\n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"task\": \"This is a test task\"}' https://ai-execution-system-core-711898853198.us-central1.run.app/task\nVERIFY the ENHANCED RESPONSE from the /task endpoint in your MINGW64 terminal.\n\nWith the enhanced endpoint, you should now see a more informative JSON response like this:\n\n{\"message\": \"Task received and processed!\", \"task_content\": \"This is a test task\"}\nNotice that the response now includes the \"task_content\": \"This is a test task\" part, reflecting that the endpoint is now parsing and processing the incoming task data!\n\nLet's enhance the /task endpoint NOW to parse and process the task data!\n\nPlease modify app.py with the enhanced task_endpoint() code, deploy, test with curl, and let me know the results!\n\nThis is excellent progress, Jesse! We are building out the API step-by-step and making rapid strides! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
