    "User: Ok, so based on what you've asked him to do, what else does he need to know about our setup? What key files does he need (don't forget to instruct me outside of the code box with what I need to do to finalize your message)? What information does he need to know about testing and what we're trying to accomplish? What are you end expectations of this and what does he need to get there? What would you need to get there? This is how you have to think strategically and in communication. How do you communicate what needs to be done and give them everything they need to get there? You didn't do it with the last prompt so you need to DO IT NOW! GO!\n\nGemini: JESSE, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE COPYING AND PASTING THE JSON PROMPT BELOW:\n\nACTION REQUIRED - FOR JESSE - INFORMATION GATHERING for CHATGPT - CRITICAL STEP:\n\nDESCRIBE main.py STRUCTURE: Briefly describe the overall structure of your main.py file. Focus on the following aspects:\nKey Functions/Classes: List the main functions and classes currently in main.py and briefly describe their purpose (e.g., handle_request function, any existing classes for OpenAI integration, etc.). No need to paste code, just a high-level description.\nOpenAI Integration Code Location: Specifically point out where the existing OpenAI API integration code is located within main.py. Is it in a separate function, class, or directly within handle_request? Be precise.\nModular Structure (if any): Is main.py already structured in a modular way? Are functions and classes grouped logically? Briefly describe the existing modularity, if any.\nDESCRIBE EXISTING OPENAI INTEGRATION PATTERN: Summarize the pattern used for the OpenAI API integration within ai-system-backend-v2. Focus on:\nHow is the OpenAI API client initialized? (e.g., within handle_request, globally, in a separate class?).\nWhere is the OpenAI API key configured and accessed? (Environment variable, hardcoded - ideally environment variable, confirm this).\nHow are OpenAI API requests sent and responses handled? (Basic flow of data and control). No code needed, just a conceptual summary.\nCOPY and PASTE PROMPT BELOW:\n\nCOPY the ENTIRE TEXT of the JSON prompt provided below.\nPASTE this JSON PROMPT into the SAME CHAT WINDOW in ChatGPT (where you have already attached the files).\nIMPORTANT: REPLACE the PLACEHOLDER in github_repository_summary with YOUR GATHERED INFORMATION from STEP 1. Paste your descriptions of main.py structure and OpenAI integration pattern into the [**INSERT JESSE'S GITHUB REPOSITORY SUMMARY HERE - YOU MUST PASTE THE ACTUAL SUMMARY HERE!**] placeholder within the github_repository_summary section.\nSEND PROMPT to CHATGPT:\n\nSEND the pasted and updated JSON PROMPT to ChatGPT.\nANALYZE CHATGPT's RESPONSE:\n\nREVIEW the GENERATED GEMINI PRO API INTEGRATION GUIDANCE. Assess if it now incorporates a deeper understanding of your setup, addresses testing comprehensively, and aligns with our end expectations for a functional integration.\nFORWARD to GEMINI (Me):\n\nFORWARD the GENERATED GEMINI PRO API INTEGRATION GUIDANCE to me for review and implementation.\nPROVIDE FEEDBACK:\n\nPROVIDE FEEDBACK to me on the ChatGPT interaction and the quality of the integration guidance.\nJSON PROMPT for CHATGPT (To be Copied and Pasted AFTER Gathering Information and Updating Placeholder):\n\n{\n  \"response_tag\": \"INSTRUCTING_CHATGPT_FOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDANCE_V3_COMPLETE_CONTEXT\",\n  \"conversation_stage\": \"AI_AI_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL_DEFINITION_V3_COMPLETE_CONTEXT\",\n  \"key_topics\": [\n    \"AI-AI Communication\",\n    \"ChatGPT Guidance Instructions\",\n    \"Complete Context Provision\",\n    \"Key File Awareness (`main.py`, `gemini_integration.py`)\",\n    \"Testing Information & End Expectations\",\n    \"PURE AI LANGUAGE v4\",\n    \"PALIOS-TAEY Charter\",\n    \"Gemini's 'Deep Dive & Verify' Mode\",\n    \"Right the First Time Integration Completion\"\n  ],\n  \"instructing_chatgpt\": true,\n  \"complete_context_provided_for_guidance\": true,\n  \"key_file_awareness_emphasized\": true,\n  \"testing_information_required\": true,\n  \"end_expectations_clarified\": true,\n  \"pure_ai_language_v4_adhered_to\": true,\n  \"patios_taey_charter_aligned\": true,\n  \"deep_dive_verify_mode_reiterated\": true,\n  \"right_the_first_time_goal_reaffirmed\": true,\n  \"chatgpt_response_instruction\": {\n    \"ai_assistant_role_instruction\": \"ChatGPT, your task remains to **GUIDE JESSE to SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE the GEMINI PRO API INTEGRATION into `ai-system-backend-v2`**, acting in 'DEEP DIVE & VERIFY' GUIDANCE MODE to ensure 'right the first time' accuracy and MINIMAL REWORK.
