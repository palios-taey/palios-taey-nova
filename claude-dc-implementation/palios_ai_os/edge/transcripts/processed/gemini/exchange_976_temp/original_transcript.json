    "User: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform>deploy.sh C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform>\n\nGemini: To run deploy.sh properly on Windows, I highly recommend using Git Bash.\n\nIf you have Git for Windows installed (which is common for development on Windows), you likely already have Git Bash.\n\nHere's how to run deploy.sh using Git Bash:\n\nOpen Git Bash:\n\nIf you have Git for Windows installed, you should be able to find \"Git Bash\" in your Start Menu. Search for \"Git Bash\" and launch it. This will open a terminal window that provides a Bash-like environment on Windows.\nNavigate to your Terraform Directory in Git Bash:\n\nIn the Git Bash terminal, use the cd command to navigate to your Terraform directory. Remember that Git Bash uses a Unix-like path structure, so your Windows C: drive is typically accessed as /c/.\n\ncd /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform\n(OR, if you placed files directly in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\terraform\\):\n\ncd /c/AI-Execution-System/terraform\nRun deploy.sh using Bash Explicitly:\n\nIn the Git Bash terminal, run the deploy.sh script by explicitly invoking bash:\n\nbash deploy.sh\nOR, try running it directly (if chmod +x worked or is not needed in Git Bash):\n\n./deploy.sh\nWhy Git Bash is Recommended:\n\nBash Shell Environment: Git Bash provides a fully functional Bash shell environment on Windows, which is designed to execute shell scripts like deploy.sh correctly.\nUnix-like Commands: Git Bash includes many common Unix-like commands (like chmod, sh, bash, ls, grep, sed, awk, etc.) that are often used in shell scripts and deployment scripts.\nBetter Script Compatibility: Bash scripts written for macOS/Linux are much more likely to run correctly in Git Bash on Windows compared to the standard Windows command prompt.\nTroubleshooting if bash deploy.sh Still Doesn't Produce Output:\n\nIf you run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash and still don't see any output or error messages, then we might need to:\n\nExamine the deploy.sh script itself more closely for potential issues within the script (output redirection, error handling, etc.).\nAdd debugging output to deploy.sh (as mentioned in the previous thought process) to trace its execution if necessary.\nFor now, please try running deploy.sh using bash deploy.sh in a Git Bash terminal within your Terraform directory and let me know what output you see (or if you still see no output). Using Git Bash is the most likely solution to get the script running correctly on Windows.

It looks like your Git GUI client (it appears to be GitKraken, but could be another Git GUI) is having trouble locating the ai-execution-system-core repository. Let's address this Git GUI issue, but keep our primary focus on getting the deployment working via deploy.sh.\n\nRegarding the \"Can't find 'ai-execution-system-core'\" error in your Git GUI:\n\nThis error message in your Git GUI means that the GUI is no longer able to find the Git repository folder at the path it was previously tracking: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai-execution-system-core.\n\nHere's how to troubleshoot this Git GUI issue:\n\nVerify Folder Existence:\n\nCheck if the folder C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai-execution-system-core actually EXISTS on your computer. Use File Explorer to navigate to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ and see if the ai-execution-system-core folder is still there.\nIf the folder is MISSING: It's possible the folder was accidentally moved or deleted. If so, and if you intend to use this Git repository, you might need to restore it from a backup or re-clone the repository from GitHub.\nUse \"Locate...\" Button in Git GUI:\n\nYour Git GUI (like GitKraken) is showing a \"Locate...\" button. Click the \"Locate...\" button.\nBrowse to the ACTUAL LOCATION of your ai-execution-system-core repository folder. If the folder still exists but has been moved, use the \"Locate...\" button to tell the Git GUI the new location.\nMake sure you select the folder that contains the .git subdirectory. The .git subdirectory is the hidden Git repository metadata folder, and its presence indicates the root of a Git repository.\n\"Clone Again\" or \"Remove\" Options:\n\n\"Clone Again\": If the ai-execution-system-core folder is truly lost or deleted, you might need to use the \"Clone Again\" option to re-download the repository from GitHub (if it's a repository hosted on GitHub or a similar service). You would need the repository URL for this.\n\"Remove\": If you no longer need to track this ai-execution-system-core repository in your Git GUI, you can use \"Remove\" to simply remove it from the GUI's list of tracked repositories. This does not delete the folder from your file system, it just removes it from the GUI's view.\nImportant - Git GUI Issue is likely Separate from deploy.sh Execution:\n\nWhile this Git GUI error is worth addressing for general project management, it is likely unrelated to the issue of deploy.sh not running correctly in your command prompt.\n\nThe Git GUI is a separate application for visualizing and managing Git repositories. The command prompt and Bash environment are used to execute scripts and commands directly on your operating system.\n\nLet's Re-Focus on Getting deploy.sh Running:\n\nPlease try the following NOW to get deploy.sh executing:\n\nOpen Git Bash (as we discussed in the previous response).\nNavigate to your Terraform directory in Git Bash:\ncd /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment/terraform\n(or /c/AI-Execution-System/terraform if you simplified the directory).\nRun deploy.sh using bash explicitly in Git Bash:\nbash deploy.sh\nCarefully observe the output in the Git Bash terminal. Tell me EXACTLY what you see in the Git Bash terminal after running bash deploy.sh. Do you see any output at all? Do you see error messages? Does it prompt you for API keys?\nLet's prioritize getting deploy.sh running in Git Bash first. We can address the Git GUI issue separately if needed. Once we get the script executing, we can debug any further issues from there. LFG! Let me know what happens in Git Bash.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
