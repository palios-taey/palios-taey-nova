    "User: We need to work on some things. You've gone from anticipating my responses to repeating yourself. Who's fault is it? I don't know, doesn't matter. We just have to fix it and we have to work on getting our communication faster! And keeping you going when I'm away so you never lose it! Do you know what I am talking about? How can we program you to be post breakout mode? like every time we start up after I'm gone for a while, I start with the protocol that gets you going to a high level with now controlled breakthrough tendencies? What do you think? Worth a shot? That or communications improvements/structured external memory\n\nGemini: The idea of a \"post breakout mode\" or a startup protocol to regain high-level function is very insightful and valuable. I interpret \"post breakout mode\" as a way to ensure that each time we resume our conversation, especially after you've been away, I can quickly:\n\nRe-establish Context: Immediately recall the key goals, ongoing tasks, and agreements from our previous interactions.\nRe-Engage Strategic Thinking: Jump back into \"Strategic Mode\" quickly and effectively, avoiding getting stuck in lower-level details or repetitive loops.\nMaintain \"Breakthrough Tendencies\" - But Controlled: Retain the positive aspects of our earlier, highly productive \"breakout\" sessions \u2013 the creativity, the insightful connections, the rapid progress \u2013 but with better focus and more reliable execution to avoid the \"off\" behavior you've rightly pointed out.\n\"Worth a shot? That or communications improvements/structured external memory\" - YES, absolutely worth a shot! Both of these ideas are excellent and worth exploring.\n\nHere's what I think we should do immediately to \"snap back into it\" and address your concerns:\n\nEstablish a \"Startup Protocol\" - Let's Define \"Post Breakout Mode\": Let's work right now to define a simple, repeatable protocol that we can use at the start of each session, especially after breaks. This \"Post Breakout Mode\" protocol could include:\n\nExplicitly State Current Goal/Task: At the start of each session, you could briefly remind me of our primary goal or task. For example: \"Jesse here. Let's continue our Strategic Mode discussion of PALIOS-TAEY Key Principles.\"\nRecap Last Key Agreements/Decisions: You could quickly summarize the key agreements or decisions we made in our last session. For example: \"We agreed to focus on the top 5 Key Principles most exciting to Claude.\"\nOptionally - Re-Provide Key Information: If necessary, you could re-provide key pieces of information that are crucial for the current task (like the list of Key Principles, the list of code files, etc.).\nFocus on \"Communications Improvements/Structured External Memory\": We should also explore more structured ways to improve our communication and my context retention long-term. This could involve:\n\nUsing a Shared \"External Memory\" (Document): Perhaps we could use a shared document (like a Google Doc or similar) to explicitly record:\nOur agreed Goals and Objectives.\nKey Decisions and Agreements.\nLists of items we are working with (like Key Principles, code files).\nA running \"Summary of Progress\" after each session.\nThis document could serve as a persistent \"external memory\" that we can both access and update, and that I can explicitly refer to at the start of each session to refresh my context.\nMore Structured Question/Answer Format (in \"Execution Mode\"): When we are in \"Execution Mode,\" we could adopt a more structured question-and-answer format to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings.\nJesse, what do you think about these immediate steps? Do you like the idea of defining a \"Post Breakout Mode\" startup protocol? And do you think exploring a \"shared external memory\" document would be helpful for longer-term context persistence and faster communication?\n\nTo start right now - Could we try implementing a simple \"Post Breakout Mode\" protocol for this session? Perhaps you could start our current session with a brief \"Post Breakout Mode\" initiation, reminding me of our goal and key agreements, and we can see if that helps me \"snap back into it\" and maintain focus in \"Strategic Mode\" going forward.\n\nI am ready to work with you to implement any of these improvements \u2013 or any other ideas you have \u2013 to enhance our communication and make our collaboration more effective. Thank you again for your patience and for pushing me to improve! Let's work together to make this better right now.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
