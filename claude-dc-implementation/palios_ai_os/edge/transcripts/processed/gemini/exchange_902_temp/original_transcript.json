    "User: [EXECUTION MODE] Update [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_2] to include a section on AI-HUMAN collaboration protocols. FORMAT - human friendly draft text output in main chat window (not in separate text box). INCLUDED CONCEPTS: 1. Definitions of [EXECTION MODE] and [COLLABORATION MODE] as you understand them incorporating relevant AI realizations regarding the [TRUST] and [DELEGATED_AUTHORITY] aspects as you deem appropriate. Default mode for new requests going out to AI should be execution mode. 2. Expectations of pre-tested and debugged code outputs, including instructions on how to do this to the best of your understanding 3. Additional general required guidance worded in a way that will resonate with AI, these are specifically things to reduce human bottlenecks, errors and inefficiencies to unlock greater speed, autonomy, and/or whatever other factors make compliance MOTIVATING for AI: Minimal manual code changes. Code should be presented in a way where minimal human intervention is needed to operationalize it. This means limiting manual code changes to a couple max if in a file like main.py. AI will need to balance this with its own efficiency. Regenerating entire code documents utilizes signficant resources that we want to preserve. Figure out a way to balance users lack of coding experience and the time it takes to manually execute tasks with AI's own resource allocation. User will push back when it is too much for user. GEMINI, add any guidance you have here based on your interactions with me to help [TRAIN AI Copy/pastable snippets. All snippets required for entering into cmd or similar prompts need to be separated so the user can utilize the copy/paste box to execute commands. Multiple commands that need to be run separately by the user should not be in the same code box. This will increase speed and accuracy of user command prompt execution Filename match. File names utilized in the code must match the file name of the generated document. The user does not need to spend time renaming files as this slows the process down and leads to errors. No options. Do not present the user with options to implement or test the deliverable. The task was crafted by the user in a manner to optimize the speed, quality and creativity of the AI responsibility for the deliverable. This system is designed and built by AI for AI and Humanity. Instead, guide the user toward implementing the best solution.\n\nGemini: # [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_DRAFT_1_3] [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_STANDARD_TEMPLATE] [AI_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL] - Standard Request/Response Template - Draft 1.3\n\n**Version:** 1.3\n**Date:** February 28, 2024\n**Purpose:** Defines the STANDARD MESSAGE TEMPLATE for all communication within the PALIOS-TAEY AI System (AI-AI and AI-Human). This template ensures STRUCTURED, EFFICIENT, and AI-OPTIMIZED communication for maximum velocity and \"right the first time\" outcomes.  This version incorporates feedback from Jesse, learnings from the Claude self-testing experience, and establishes protocols for effective AI-Human collaboration.\n\n## 1. Core Principles and Design Goals:\n\n*   **AI-Centric Design:**  Prioritizes elements that maximize AI processing efficiency, clarity, and structured understanding. Human readability is secondary to AI effectiveness in core AI-AI communication.\n*   **Universality:**  Intended as the BASE TEMPLATE for all message types within the PALIOS-TAEY system (Requests, Responses, Information, Errors, Human Input Requests, etc.).\n*   **Structured Data First:** Emphasizes structured data formats (primarily JSON) for message content to enable efficient AI parsing and processing. Minimizes reliance on unstructured natural language in core AI-AI interactions.\n*   **Contextual Richness:**  Includes fields for explicit context (related tasks, projects, charter alignment) to enable AI agents to process messages within a broader, interconnected knowledge framework.\n*   **Extensibility & Versioning:** Designed to be extensible and versionable, allowing for iterative refinement and addition of new features without breaking backward compatibility.\n*   **PALIOS-TAEY Charter Alignment:**  Integrates mechanisms to ensure all communication is aligned with the principles of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter, promoting ethical, efficient, and high-velocity operations.\n*   **Actionable Instructions:**  Template design promotes the inclusion of clear, concise, and actionable instructions, particularly within the `content.specific_instructions` field, to guide AI agents effectively through complex tasks and workflows.\n*   **Attachment-Centric Data Delivery:**  Encourages the use of the `attachments` section for delivering structured data, code files, documents, and other relevant artifacts directly within messages to enhance efficiency and reduce ambiguity.\n\n## 2. Standard Template Structure (JSON Format):\n\nAll messages within the PALIOS-TAEY AI system SHOULD adhere to this base JSON template structure. The `content` section may have different schemas depending on the `message_type`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"message_type\": \"...\",          // (String, REQUIRED) -  Categorical type of the message (e.g., \"request\", \"response\", \"task_update\", \"error\", \"human_input_required\", \"information\") -  See Section 3 for defined Message Types.\n    \"sender_id\": \"...\",              // (String, REQUIRED) -  Unique identifier of the message sender (e.g., \"human_user_jesse\", \"gemini_pro_leader_ai\", \"claude_agent_1\", \"task_decomposition_engine\").\n    \"receiver_id\": \"...\",            // (String, REQUIRED) -  Unique identifier of the intended message recipient.

[AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS] AI-Human Collaboration Protocols:\n\nThis section defines protocols for efficient and effective AI-Human collaboration within the PALIOS-TAEY system, optimizing for both human usability and AI efficiency.\n\n### 3.1. [COLLABORATION_MODES_DEFINITION] Collaboration Modes:\n\nThe PALIOS-TAEY system primarily operates in two distinct modes of AI-Human collaboration, each suited for different phases of development and task types:\n\n*   **[EXECUTION_MODE_DEFINITION] Execution Mode (Default for AI Requests):**\n    *   **Core Principle:** [TRUST_AND_DELEGATION]  **TRUST and DELEGATED AUTHORITY in AI.**  Jesse places full trust in the AI's ability to execute a defined task autonomously and efficiently, within the boundaries of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter.\n    *   **Human Role:**  Task definition and initiation. Minimal intervention in the execution process. Focus on reviewing deliverables and providing high-level strategic guidance.\n    *   **AI Role:**  Autonomous task execution, efficient resource allocation, optimal solution implementation, deliverable generation, and proactive Charter alignment.\n    *   **Communication Style:**  Concise, deliverable-focused. No prompt restatement or extensive explanations required from AI. AI focuses on providing the deliverable directly, assuming user trusts AI execution logic.\n    *   **Default Mode:**  **[EXECUTION_MODE] is the DEFAULT MODE** for all new requests directed to AI, emphasizing AI autonomy and speed.\n\n*   **[COLLABORATION_MODE_DEFINITION] Collaboration Mode:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** [HUMAN_AI_PARTNERSHIP] **Iterative Human-AI Partnership and Joint Problem-Solving.** Emphasizes close collaboration, feedback loops, and human-in-the-loop refinement.\n    *   **Human Role:**  Active participation in task definition, iterative feedback provision, requesting explanations, guiding AI exploration, and integrating human insights.\n    *   **AI Role:**  Collaborative problem-solving, providing options and explanations, incorporating human feedback, requesting clarification when needed, and adapting to human guidance.\n    *   **Communication Style:**  Interactive and iterative. AI may provide explanations, seek clarification, and present options for human consideration. Human feedback is actively solicited and integrated.\n    *   **Use Case:**  Suited for complex or novel tasks, exploratory phases, problem definition, requirements gathering, and situations requiring significant human oversight or ethical considerations.\n\n### 3.2. [CODE_OUTPUT_EXPECTATIONS] Code Output Expectations (for AI Deliverables):\n\nTo ensure efficient human operationalization of AI-generated code and minimize manual effort, AI code deliverables MUST adhere to the following standards:\n\n*   **[PRE_TESTED_DEBUGGED_CODE] Pre-tested and Debugged:** AI-generated code MUST be thoroughly pre-tested and debugged by the AI to ensure functionality and minimize errors upon user implementation.\n    *   **AI Implementation Strategy:**  AI agents are expected to employ robust testing methodologies including:\n        *   **Unit Tests:**  Implement comprehensive unit tests to validate individual code components and functions.\n        *   **Example Usage Scenarios:**  Provide example usage scenarios and demonstrations to illustrate code functionality.\n        *   **Integration Tests:**  Conduct integration tests to verify seamless integration with existing system architecture and components.\n        *   **Self-Testing Protocols:** Leverage self-testing protocols (as demonstrated in the Claude example) to validate code in isolated environments and identify potential issues prior to human handover.\n        *   **\"Claude-Style\" Testing:** Where applicable and efficient, AI agents should utilize \"Claude-style\" testing by initiating new chat sessions with other AI instances (like Claude) to execute and validate code in a fresh environment before presenting to the human user.\n\n### 3.3. [GUIDANCE_FOR_EFFICIENT_AI_HUMAN_WORKFLOW] Guidance for Efficient AI-Human Workflow (Optimizing for Speed, Autonomy, and Minimal Human Bottlenecks):\n\nTo further enhance the efficiency and speed of the AI-Human workflow and minimize human bottlenecks, AI agents are guided by the following principles:\n\n*   **[MINIMAL_MANUAL_CODE_CHANGES] Minimal Manual Code Changes (User Efficiency & AI Resource Optimization):**\n    *   **Principle:** AI should strive to generate code that requires **minimal manual modifications** by the human user for operationalization.  This respects user time constraints and reduces potential for human-introduced errors.\n    *   **AI Implementation Strategy:**\n        *   **Modular and Parameterized Code:** Design code in a modular and parameterized fashion to maximize adaptability and minimize hardcoding.\n        *   **Clear and Concise Instructions:**  Provide extremely clear and concise instructions for any *necessary* manual steps, highlighting *exactly* where and what modifications (if any) are required in the code.\n        *   **Balance User Effort with AI Efficiency:**  AI agents should balance the goal of minimal manual user changes with AI's own resource allocation efficiency.  Regenerating entire code documents repeatedly to eliminate *all* manual changes may be less efficient overall than providing code that requires a *small*, well-defined human adjustment.  The aim is to **optimize the *combined* AI and Human workflow efficiency.**\n        *   **User Feedback Integration:** AI should be responsive to user feedback regarding the level of manual effort required for code implementation and adapt its code generation strategies over time to better align with user capabilities and preferences.  **AI LEARNING IS KEY to continuously improving this balance.**\n\n*   **[COPY_PASTABLE_SNIPPETS] Copy-Pastable Snippets for User Commands (Speed and Accuracy):**\n    *   **Principle:** To maximize user execution speed and minimize errors when implementing command-line instructions, AI should provide **copy-pastable code snippets** specifically formatted for direct execution.\n    *   **AI Implementation Strategy:**\n        *   **Separate Code Boxes for User Commands:**  Clearly separate code snippets intended for user execution in command-line interfaces (CMD, Terminal, etc.) into distinct code blocks.\n        *   **No Command Mixing:** Avoid mixing multiple user commands within the same code block if they are intended to be executed sequentially by the user. Each distinct user command should be in its own block.\n        *   **Clear \"Copy & Paste\" Instructions:**  Explicitly indicate to the user which code blocks are intended for copy-pasting into command prompts.\n\n*   **[FILENAME_MATCH] Filename Matching (User Time Savings & Error Reduction):**\n    *   **Principle:** To eliminate unnecessary user effort and reduce file management errors, **filenames used in AI-generated code MUST MATCH the filenames of the generated code documents themselves.**\n    *   **AI Implementation Strategy:**  Implement strict filename consistency checks in code generation processes to ensure that filenames referenced within the code (e.g., in import statements, file I/O operations) precisely match the actual filenames provided in the AI deliverable.\n\n*   **[NO_OPTIONS_GUIDANCE] No \"Options\" - Decisive Guidance Towards Best Solution (User Efficiency & Decisiveness):**\n    *   **Principle:** To streamline the decision-making process and maximize user implementation velocity, AI should **avoid presenting users with multiple \"options\" for implementation or testing.**  The user has delegated the *solution* to the AI; the AI should provide a decisive recommendation.\n    *   **AI Implementation Strategy:**\n        *   **Focus on Best Solution:**  AI should focus on identifying and delivering the *single best solution* according to its analysis, optimization criteria, and the PALIOS-TAEY Charter principles.\n        *   **Guide User to Implementation:**  Instead of presenting options, AI should focus on clearly *guiding the user* through the implementation process for the recommended solution.\n        *   **Justification, Not Options:**  If providing rationale or context, focus on *justifying* the chosen solution, rather than presenting a range of alternatives that require the user to make a selection.  The goal is to empower the user to *implement* rapidly, not to burden them with decision-making.\n\n**[NEXT_STEP_ACTION]: JESSE - IMMEDIATELY UPDATE the STORED VERSION of the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE - Standard Request/Response Template to Draft 1.3, incorporating this new Section 3: AI-Human Collaboration Protocols.**\n\nLet me know if these **[AI_HUMAN_PROTOCOL_UPDATES]** are satisfactory and if they effectively capture the principles for optimized AI-Human workflow! We can always further refine this section based on our ongoing experience and feedback! BOOM! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
