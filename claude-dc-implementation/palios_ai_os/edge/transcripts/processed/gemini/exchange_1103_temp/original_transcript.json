    "User: It still isn't recognizing it. Checked variables. Exactly as you have it. pip and python still work. I also restarted my computer\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_c0f861.png\n\nGemini: Copy and Paste Your User Path Variable Content:\n\nGo back to the \"Environment Variables\" window.\nIn the \"User variables for jesse\" section, select the Path variable and click \"Edit...\".\nIn the \"Edit User Variable\" window, copy the entire list of paths shown there.\nPaste the entire list of paths into your response here. I need to see the exact text of your User Path variable to check for any subtle errors or typos.\nVerify Command Prompt is Definitely New:\n\nPlease confirm that after adding the User Path and restarting your computer, you are opening a brand new command prompt window each time you test git filter-repo --version. A new command prompt is essential to pick up the updated environment variables. Just to be absolutely sure, close all command prompt windows you have open, and then open a completely new one (Windows key -> cmd -> Enter).\nTest git-filter-repo.exe with FULL PATH (Again):\n\nIn a new command prompt window, please run this command exactly as written, with the double quotes:\n\n\"C:\\Users\\jesse\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python313\\Scripts\\git-filter-repo.exe\" --version\nTell me the exact output of this command. It's critical to know if running it with the full path works or not.\n\nAfter you provide me with your User Path content and the output of the full path command test, we will have the information we need to make the absolute final steps to get git-filter-repo working and finish removing those large files! We are incredibly close now!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
