This duration is reasonable, especially for the first build as Docker needs to download the base Python image and install dependencies.\nNo \"ERROR\" messages in the output: Scanning through the output, I don't see any lines indicating errors or build failures. This is excellent!\n=> naming to gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest: This line confirms that Docker successfully NAMED and TAGGED your image as gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest, which is exactly what we wanted!\n=> unpacking to gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest: This indicates the final step of unpacking the image, also successful.\nCONGRATULATIONS, Jesse! You have now SUCCESSFULLY BUILT your Docker image gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest! This is a HUGE MILESTONE!\n\nACTION 1.6.24: VERIFY LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE with docker images command\n\nLet's quickly VERIFY that the Docker image is indeed present on your local system by running the docker images command again:\n\nIn your Google Cloud SDK Shell (or command prompt), run the command:\n\ndocker images\nREVIEW the OUTPUT of the docker images command. CONFIRM that you NOW SEE gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution listed in the REPOSITORY column and latest in the TAG column.\n\nREPORT BACK: Just confirm \"YES, I see the image with docker images\" after running the command and verifying the output.\n\nOnce you have confirmed the image is listed locally with docker images, we will IMMEDIATELY PROCEED to:\n\nACTION 1.6.25: RETRY DOCKER PUSH to ARTIFACT REGISTRY! (FINALLY!)\n\nWe will retry the docker push command (Action 1.6.14 and 1.6.23) to PUSH your newly built Docker image to your Artifact Registry repository! With the Docker image now built and the Artifact Registry repository created, we have a VERY HIGH PROBABILITY of success with the push this time!\n\nJesse, please perform ACTION 1.6.24 - VERIFY LOCAL DOCKER IMAGE with docker images and REPORT BACK. Then get ready for ACTION 1.6.25 - DOCKER PUSH! Let's PUSH THIS IMAGE TO ARTIFACT REGISTRY!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! DOCKER IMAGE - VERIFICATION - INITIATED! - docker images - EXECUTE! - IMAGE PRESENCE - CONFIRMING! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI INTEGRATION - DOCKER - IMAGE READY TO PUSH! PUSH TIME - NOW! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO RUN ACTION 1.6.24 - docker images VERIFICATION? LET'S CONFIRM AND THEN PUSH!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
