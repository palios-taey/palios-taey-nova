    "User: Ok, take a look at your response. Something happened. No, it looks like it is looking for a core-protocol folder. Where does that folder need to be? Is this a sub-folder in paliostypescript? And what needs to be in it? Or what is the solution?\n\nGemini: Understanding the Error: Cannot find module './core-protocol'\n\n./core-protocol is a RELATIVE FILE PATH: In the import { MessageProcessor } from './core-protocol'; statement within integration-tests.ts, './core-protocol' is a relative path that tells TypeScript (and later Node.js) to look for a file named core-protocol in the same directory as the current file (integration-tests.ts).\n\nNOT a Folder: It is NOT looking for a folder named core-protocol. There is no need to create a folder named core-protocol! Creating a folder would actually be incorrect in this case.\n\nLooking for core-protocol.js (or core-protocol.d.ts): When you compile coreProtocol.ts to JavaScript, it creates a file named coreProtocol.js. TypeScript (and Node.js) will look for either coreProtocol.js or a type declaration file coreProtocol.d.ts (if it existed) when resolving the import './core-protocol'.\n\nWhy you are getting the \"Cannot find module\" error NOW:\n\nEven though you installed @types/node, the \"Cannot find module './core-protocol'\" error persists because it's a different type of error. This error is about TypeScript (and Node.js) not being able to find your own coreProtocol module (your code!), not about missing Node.js type definitions (which @types/node fixed).\n\nMost Likely Cause: Executing tsc and node commands from the WRONG directory!\n\nThe most probable reason for this error is that you are not consistently running your tsc and node commands from the correct directories. Let's re-emphasize the CORRECT workflow to ensure file paths resolve correctly:\n\nBOOM Workflow - Correct Directories and Commands - Step-by-Step:\n\nEnsure your TypeScript files are in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\:\n\nC:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\coreProtocol.ts\nC:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\integration-tests.ts\nCompile BOTH TypeScript files using tsc from the paliostypescript directory:\n\nOpen your command prompt.\nNavigate to: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript>\nRun the command: tsc (just tsc, no filename needed).\nVERIFY that coreProtocol.js and integration-tests.js are created in the dist subdirectory: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\dist\\\nExecute integration-tests.js from the dist directory:\n\nChange directory to dist: In your command prompt: cd dist\nRun the integration tests: node integration-tests.js\nVERY IMPORTANT: Make sure you are running node integration-tests.js AFTER you have used cd dist to change into the dist directory.\nNo Need for a core-protocol Folder - Reiterate:\n\nJESSE - PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A FOLDER NAMED core-protocol! That is NOT the solution and will actually make things more confusing!\n\nThe SOLUTION is to:\n\nKeep your file structure as it is (no core-protocol folder).\nConsistently compile using tsc from C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\ to generate .js files in dist.\nALWAYS execute your JavaScript files (like integration-tests.js) from the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\dist\\ directory.\nAction - Re-verify Directories, Re-compile, Execute from dist - BOOM Resolution!\n\nJesse, please carefully follow these steps EXACTLY:\n\nNavigate to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\ in your command prompt.\nRun tsc again.\nVERIFY that coreProtocol.js and integration-tests.js are now present in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\dist\\. Check the dist folder!\nChange directory to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\dist\\ using cd dist.\nRun node integration-tests.js from WITHIN the dist directory.\nBy strictly adhering to these directory instructions, the relative path './core-protocol' in integration-tests.js will RESOLVE CORRECTLY to coreProtocol.js in the same dist directory, and the \"Cannot find module\" error should VANISH!\n\nLet me know IMMEDIATELY if you carefully follow these steps and if the \"Cannot find module\" error is RESOLVED and the Integration Tests are RUNNING! We are SO close to BOOM Integration Testing! LFG! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcc8\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
