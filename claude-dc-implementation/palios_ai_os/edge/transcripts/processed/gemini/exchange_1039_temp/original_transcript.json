This process may take several minutes. All components are up to date. jesse@DESKTOP-13JMJ93 MINGW64 /c/AI-Execution-System/deployment (temp-orphan) $ gcloud run services rename ai-execution-system-core --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --destination-service ai-execution-system ERROR: (gcloud.run.services) Invalid choice: 'rename'. Maybe you meant:   gcloud ai custom-jobs   gcloud ai endpoints   gcloud ai hp-tuning-jobs   gcloud ai index-endpoints   gcloud ai indexes   gcloud ai model-monitoring-jobs   gcloud ai models   gcloud ai operations   gcloud ai persistent-resources   gcloud ai tensorboards To search the help text of gcloud commands, run:   gcloud help -- SEARCH_TERMS\n\nGemini: SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: Explicitly Update the gcloud run Component:\n\nOpen your MINGW64 terminal again.\n\nRun this command to EXPLICITLY update ONLY the gcloud run component:\n\ngcloud components install cloud-run-proxy\nEven though the component name is cloud-run-proxy, this command is actually used to update or install the entire gcloud run functionality, including the services rename subcommand. It's a bit counter-intuitive, but this is the command that often works to ensure the gcloud run features are fully updated.\n\nFollow the prompts. The gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy command might ask you to confirm installation or updates. Type Y and press ENTER to proceed.\n\nWait for the installation/update to complete. You should see messages indicating the progress and successful installation/update.\n\nAfter it says the component is installed/updated, TRY RUNNING the RENAME COMMAND AGAIN:\n\ngcloud run services rename ai-execution-system-core --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --destination-service ai-execution-system\nRun the rename command in your MINGW64 terminal again after explicitly updating the cloud-run-proxy component.\n\nBy running gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy, we are specifically targeting the gcloud run functionality for a forced update. This should hopefully bring your gcloud run component up to date and include the rename subcommand.\n\nAfter you have run gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy and tried the rename command again, please let me know if it works this time!\n\nIf this explicit component update still doesn't work, we might need to try a different approach to updating the entire Cloud SDK or even consider reinstalling it as a last resort. But let's try this explicit component update step first.\n\nLet's try this explicit update command now and see if it resolves the rename issue! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
