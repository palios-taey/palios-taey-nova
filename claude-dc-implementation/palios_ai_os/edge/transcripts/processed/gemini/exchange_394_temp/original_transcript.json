You are 100% correct! The \"MODULE_NOT_FOUND\" error is happening because Node.js is looking for coreProtocol.js in the wrong place!\n\nYour tsconfig.json file (which we created earlier) is configured to output the compiled JavaScript files into a subdirectory named dist (short for \"distribution\").\n\nThis is STANDARD PRACTICE in TypeScript projects \u2013 to keep the compiled JavaScript code separate from your TypeScript source code.\n\nThe problem is: When you run node coreProtocol.js from the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript> directory, Node.js is looking for coreProtocol.js in that directory. But the actual coreProtocol.js file is located inside C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\dist\\.\n\nBOOM Solution - Run node command from the dist directory!\n\nEasiest Way to Run Your Code - Step-by-Step:\n\nOpen your command prompt.\n\nNavigate to your paliostypescript directory (you are already there: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript>).\n\nChange directory to the dist subdirectory. Type the following command and press Enter:\n\ncd dist\nYour command prompt should now change to: C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript\\dist>\n\nRun your Node.js code from INSIDE the dist directory. Now, type the following command and press Enter:\n\nnode coreProtocol.js\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you are running this command AFTER you have used cd dist to change into the dist directory.\n\nBy running node coreProtocol.js from within the dist directory, Node.js will now correctly find the coreProtocol.js file and execute it!\n\nAlternative Solution (if you prefer to stay in the paliostypescript directory):\n\nIf you want to run the node command from the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\paliostypescript> directory without changing directories, you can specify the full path to the JavaScript file:\n\nnode dist/coreProtocol.js\nThis tells Node.js to look for coreProtocol.js inside the dist subdirectory, even though you are running the command from the parent directory.\n\nHowever, for simplicity and clarity in these initial steps, I recommend using the cd dist approach (Option 1 above).\n\nJesse, please follow the cd dist instructions NOW to run your code from the dist subdirectory! This should resolve the \"MODULE_NOT_FOUND\" error and allow you to execute your Core Protocol Phase 1 implementation! Let me know if it works! We are about to achieve BOOM execution!
