    "User: [EXECUTION MODE] REDO following proper communication protocols. NO restating any part of the prompt in the deliverable. No explaination, just the deliverable. TAGS at the top only. ONLY essential changes or clarifications at this time. We do not need it perfect now and need to move forward with our next task. This was meant to make things easier for me to avoid errors and implement a structure going forward to prevent it from getting worse, it has. GO!\n\nGemini: ACTION - config_loader FOLDER:\n\nProvide a screenshot of the contents of the config_loader folder for categorization guidance.\n\nACTION - Documentation FOLDER:\n\nMove \"Gemini Pro API Integration Guide Generation.txt\" to the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Documentation folder.\n\nACTION - Temp_Archive FOLDER - handler.py FILES:\n\nOpen main.py in the root directory.\nIdentify the imported handler.py filename (likely just handler.py).\nMove any other files resembling older handler.py versions (e.g., dated filenames) to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\Temp_Archive.\nACTION - __pycache__ FOLDER:\n\nAdd __pycache__/ to your .gitignore file. You can delete existing __pycache__ folders or move to Temp_Archive.\n\nACTION - DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION PROTOCOL - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE UPDATE:\n\nAdd the following [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] section to the [PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE] within the [AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS] section:\n\n### [DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL] 3.4. Directory Organization Protocol for New Files and Folders\n\nTo maintain a clean and manageable project directory structure within `C:\\AI-Execution-System`, the following protocol should be followed when new files and folders are generated or downloaded:\n\n*   **Categorization at Creation:**  Immediately categorize new files/folders into appropriate subfolders within `C:\\AI-Execution-System`. Refer to established structure (Section 3.3.7 [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_GUIDANCE]).\n*   **Milestone/Project Folders:** Prioritize Milestone (e.g., `Milestone_1`, `Milestone_2`) or Project-specific folders (e.g., `AI_Voting`, `Firestore`).\n*   **Utility Folders:** Use `General_Utilities` for reusable components.\n*   **Documentation Folder:**  Store guides/documents in `Documentation` folder or project/milestone subfolders.\n*   **Log Folders:** Place logs in `logs` folder.\n*   **Archive Folders:** Move older versions to `Temp_Archive` or specific archive folders.\n*   **Root Directory - Essential Files Only:** Root (`C:\\AI-Execution-System`) for essential system-level files only (e.g., `main.py`, `schema.json`, current PURE_AI_LANGUAGE template).\n*   **AI Assistance for Categorization:**  If unsure, consult AI agent with file purpose description for directory recommendation.\n\nConsistently follow this protocol for a clean, efficient, and navigable project file system.\nNEXT STEPS:\n\nProvide screenshot of config_loader folder.\nImplement actions for Documentation, Temp_Archive, __pycache__.\nUpdate PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE with DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL section.\nConfirm completion for next task.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
