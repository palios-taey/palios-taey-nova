Make sure you understand this and are okay with it.\n\nAfter you run git push --force origin main, please let me know if it is successful! This should be the command that finally pushes your cleaned repository to GitHub without the large file errors.\n\nI am very hopeful and excited that this will be the command that finally resolves this entire long process! Let's see what happens!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
