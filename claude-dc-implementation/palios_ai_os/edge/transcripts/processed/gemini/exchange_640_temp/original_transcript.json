    "User: Does it need a container to deploy to? I changed it to aiplatform. It's working.\n\nGemini: CLOUD FUNCTIONS (1st Gen) are serverless. This means you don't have to build or manage containers yourself to deploy a basic Cloud Function. Google Cloud handles the containerization under the hood for you.\nYOU just provide the code (like main.py) and the dependencies (requirements.txt), and Google Cloud Functions builds and runs the container for you automatically. You don't interact with containers directly for basic Cloud Function deployment.\nCLOUD RUN (which you saw in the search results) is a more general container-based platform. If you were deploying to Cloud Run directly, you would typically need to build a container image.\nCLOUD FUNCTIONS (2nd Gen), by default, are now also based on Cloud Run infrastructure. This is what the \"2nd gen functions by default\" message in the terminal was about. However, even for 2nd Gen Cloud Functions, for simple use cases, you still don't usually need to build containers yourself - Google Cloud still often handles it.\nIn summary: For deploying our basic ai_system.py as a Cloud Function (1st Gen or 2nd Gen, for now), we do not need to worry about building or managing containers directly. Google Cloud Functions abstracts that away for us.\n\n2. \"I changed it to aiplatform. It's working.\" - FANTASTIC!\n\nYES! Changing google-cloud-vertexai to google-cloud-aiplatform in requirements.txt was likely the KEY FIX!\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform is the correct and current Python client library for interacting with Vertex AI services on Google Cloud.\ngoogle-cloud-vertexai might be an older or less common name (or perhaps even a typo earlier, even though we thought we checked the spelling!). The official documentation and examples generally use google-cloud-aiplatform.\nBY CHANGING TO google-cloud-aiplatform in requirements.txt, you provided the Cloud Function build process with the correct package name to install the Vertex AI client library! That's why the \"No matching distribution found\" error went away, and the build is now working!\nTHIS IS EXCELLENT PROGRESS, JESSE! YOU HAVE LIKELY SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED YOUR CLOUD FUNCTION!\n\nTO CONFIRM, PLEASE CHECK THE TERMINAL OUTPUT AGAIN. DO YOU SEE A \"Function URL\" IN THE OUTPUT NOW? It will look something like:\n\n...  Function 'ai-system-backend' deployed.\n...  For Cloud Functions in us-central1:\n...  Function URL (httpTrigger): [CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL]\nIF YOU SEE THE \"Function URL\", PLEASE COPY IT AND PASTE IT HERE!\n\nTHEN, OPEN THAT \"Function URL\" in your web browser. DO YOU SEE THE {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"} JSON RESPONSE IN YOUR BROWSER?\n\nPLEASE CONFIRM:\n\n\"YES, I SEE 'Function URL' in the terminal output! FUNCTION URL: [PASTE YOUR URL HERE]\"\n\"YES, HEALTH CHECK TEST SUCCESSFUL! BROWSER SHOWS: {\"status\": \"healthy from Cloud Function\"}\"\nONCE WE CONFIRM THIS, WE WILL HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED OUR ai_system.py HEALTH CHECK TO GOOGLE CLOUD FUNCTIONS! A HUGE MVP MILESTONE!\n\nLET'S TEST IT AND CONFIRM! GO! GO! GO!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
