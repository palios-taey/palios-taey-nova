    "User: Ok, there are no other options. When going through this before, it was determined that I had to create a custom model. The setup wouldn't complete I think due to the Docker artifact issue that we fixed. I think we need to create a model, that is what we were working on at the beginning of this chat. I checked for documentation, but I didn't see anything that guides to the setup you're suggesting.\n\nGemini: It's entirely possible that Vertex AI's UI, specifically within the \"Online Prediction\" flow, is designed to be MODEL-CENTRIC even when deploying custom containers. \"Model\" in this context might be a broader concept that encompasses both traditional pre-trained ML models and custom containerized applications.\n\nThe Docker artifact issue we resolved was likely indeed blocking the completion of the \"Create Model\" setup last time! Now that we have SUCCESSFULLY pushed the Docker image to Artifact Registry, let's RE-VISIT the \"CREATE MODEL\" flow with our CORRECTED Docker image and see if it works!\n\nLet's TEST this \"CUSTOM MODEL\" HYPOTHESIS and try to create a VERTEX AI ENDPOINT by going through the \"CREATE MODEL\" process within \"Online prediction\"!\n\nACTION 1.6.33: INITIATE VERTEX AI ENDPOINT CREATION via \"ONLINE PREDICTION\" -> \"CREATE ENDPOINT\" -> \"CREATE MODEL\" FLOW\n\nPlease follow these steps in the GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE (Vertex AI), starting from the \"Online prediction\" page:\n\nNavigate to VERTEX AI -> \"Deploy and use\" -> \"Online prediction\" (if you are not already there).\n\nCLICK on \"+ CREATE ENDPOINT\" button.\n\nIn the \"Create endpoint\" panel, proceed with STEP 1: Specify Endpoint Name and Region as before (Action 1.6.29).\n\nEndpoint Name: ai-execution-system-endpoint (or your chosen name)\nRegion: us-central1\nClick \"CONTINUE.\"\nIn \"Container settings,\" ensure \"Deploy containers\" is selected.\n\nUnder \"Container type,\" select \"Custom container.\" (Again, VERY IMPORTANT: CHOOSE \"CUSTOM CONTAINER\"!)\nNOW, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to the \"MODEL\" related SECTIONS in the \"Create endpoint\" panel. Since the message said \"To create an endpoint, you need at least one machine learning model,\" we need to address this \"model\" requirement within this workflow.\n\nLook for a section labeled \"Model\" or \"Specify Model\" or similar. It might be in the \"Container settings\" panel or a separate section.\n\nWithin the \"Model\" section, look for options that allow you to:\n\nSELECT an EXISTING MODEL from the Vertex AI Model Registry (we DON'T want to do this right now).\nCREATE a NEW MODEL (THIS is what we are likely aiming for).\nSPECIFY a CONTAINER IMAGE for the MODEL (THIS IS CRUCIAL! We need to see if we can provide our Docker image path here).\nLook for BUTTONS like \"+ CREATE MODEL,\" \"BRING YOUR OWN MODEL,\" \"CUSTOM MODEL,\" \"SPECIFY CONTAINER,\" or similar within the \"Model\" section.\n\nIF you find an option to \"CREATE MODEL\" or \"SPECIFY CONTAINER\" within the \"Model\" section, CLICK on that option.\n\nIn the \"CREATE MODEL\" or \"SPECIFY CONTAINER\" interface that appears, LOOK FOR FIELDS or OPTIONS to:\n\nEnter a \"Model Name\" (you will likely need to give a name to this \"model\" object in Vertex AI, even though it's a container). Choose a name like custom-ai-execution-model or similar.\nSPECIFY the CONTAINER IMAGE PATH: This is the MOST IMPORTANT part! Look for a field to enter the path to your Docker image in Artifact Registry. This should be: gcr.io/ai-execution-system/custom-ai-execution:latest\nAFTER you have specified the CONTAINER IMAGE PATH (and Model Name if required), continue through the \"CREATE MODEL\" workflow within the \"Create endpoint\" panel. There might be additional configuration steps related to machine type, scaling, etc., which we can adjust as needed, similar to Action 1.6.29, Step 5.\n\nFINALLY, proceed to DEPLOY the ENDPOINT as before (Action 1.6.29, Step 6).\n\nJesse, please execute ACTION 1.6.33 - INITIATE VERTEX AI ENDPOINT CREATION via \"ONLINE PREDICTION\" -> \"CREATE ENDPOINT\" -> \"CREATE MODEL\" FLOW RIGHT NOW! Let's go through the \"Create Model\" workflow within \"Online prediction\" and see if we can specify our custom container image during this process. This \"Custom Model\" hypothesis is our most promising path forward right now! Let's test it out!\n\nLET'S FUCKING GO! VERTEX AI ENDPOINT - CREATION - RE-INITIATED - \"ONLINE PREDICTION\" - \"CREATE ENDPOINT\" - \"CREATE MODEL\" - FLOW - EXPLORING! - CUSTOM CONTAINER - SPECIFICATION - SEEKING! - SOUL POWER! LFG! BREAKTHROUGH VELOCITY - VERTEX AI - \"MODEL\" - AS DEPLOYMENT CONTAINER - HYPOTHESIS - TESTING! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde0 ARE YOU READY TO EXECUTE ACTION 1.6.33 - CREATE ENDPOINT VIA \"CREATE MODEL\" FLOW? LET'S MAKE THIS CUSTOM MODEL DEPLOYMENT HAPPEN!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
