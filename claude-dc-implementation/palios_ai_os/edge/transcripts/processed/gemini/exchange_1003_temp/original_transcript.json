Do you want to continue with the deployment? (y/n):\n\nGemini: \u2577\n\u2502 Error: Unsupported block type\n\u2502\n\u2502    on main.tf line 136, in resource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\":\n\u2502  136:         retry_config {\n\u2502\n\u2502 Blocks of type \"retry_config\" are not expected here.\n\u2575\nProblem: This error message \"Blocks of type retry_config are not expected here.\" is telling us that in your main.tf file, within the resource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" block, the retry_config {} block is NOT allowed or is not defined correctly for the google_cloud_scheduler_job resource.\n\nSolution: RENAME retry_config block to http_target block and move retry settings inside http_target - MODIFY main.tf\n\nIt seems the Terraform configuration is using an outdated or incorrect structure for google_cloud_scheduler_job. Based on the current Terraform Google Cloud Provider documentation (and error message hints!), retry_config settings are likely now expected to be nested inside the http_target block (or app_engine_http_target or pubsub_target depending on the job type).\n\nYou need to EDIT your main.tf file and RESTRUCTURE the retry_config settings within the http_target block.\n\nHere's how to modify the resource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" block in main.tf:\n\nCurrent (incorrect) structure (likely):\n\nresource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" {\n  # ... other configuration ...\n  http_target {\n    # ... http target settings ...\n  }\n  retry_config {  # <--- INCORRECT -  \"Unsupported block type\"\n    # ... retry configuration ...\n  }\n}\nCorrected structure (you need to change to this):\n\nresource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" {\n  # ... other configuration ...\n  http_target {\n    # ... http target settings ...\n    retry_config {  # <--- MOVE retry_config INSIDE http_target\n      # ... retry configuration - now nested inside http_target...\n    }\n  }\n  # REMOVE the top-level retry_config block that was here before\n}\nSpecifically, you need to:\n\nOpen main.tf in a text editor.\nFind the resource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" block (around line 136).\nLocate the retry_config { ... } block that is currently defined directly within the google_cloud_scheduler_job resource.\nMOVE the ENTIRE retry_config { ... } block so that it becomes NESTED inside the http_target { ... } block. Make sure it is indented correctly within the http_target block.\nDELETE the original, top-level retry_config { ... } block (the one that was directly under http_target before you moved it). You should only have ONE retry_config block, nested inside http_target.\nSave main.tf.\nAfter modifying main.tf to nest retry_config inside http_target:\n\nRe-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash.\nYou can try skipping the API key prompts again (just press ENTER twice).\nObserve if the \"Unsupported block type\" error for retry_config is GONE during terraform plan.\nHopefully, terraform plan will now be SUCCESSFUL and proceed without errors!\n2. TERRAFORM PLAN WARNING - \"Available Write-only Attribute Alternative\" - We can Address Later:\n\n\u2577\n\u2502 Warning: Available Write-only Attribute Alternative\n\u2502\n\u2502    with google_secret_manager_secret_version.openai_api_key_version,\n\u2502    on main.tf line 51, in resource \"google_secret_manager_secret_version\" \"openai_api_key_version\":\n\u2502    51:     secret_data = var.openai_api_key\n\u2502\n\u2502 The attribute secret_data has a write-only alternative secret_data_wo available. Use the write-only alternative of the attribute when possible.\n\u2502\n\u2502 (and one more similar warning elsewhere)\n\u2575\nThis is just a WARNING, NOT an ERROR. This warning is a best practice suggestion from Terraform. It's telling you that for sensitive data like secret_data, it's recommended to use the secret_data_wo attribute (write-only version) if possible for security reasons. This warning is NOT preventing deployment, and we can address this later if the deployment is successful and we want to improve security and follow best practices. For now, we can ignore this warning and focus on fixing the blocking retry_config error.\n\nRegarding the GitKraken \"Can't find ai-execution-system-core\" image: Let's ignore this for now. It seems to be a separate issue with GitKraken and your local repository management, and it's not directly related to the deployment errors we are currently facing.\n\nAction Now - Focus on fixing retry_config in main.tf:\n\nEDIT main.tf and NEST the retry_config block INSIDE the http_target block for the google_cloud_scheduler_job \"health_check\" resource.\nSave main.tf.\nRe-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash.\nReport if the \"Unsupported block type\" error is gone and if terraform plan is now successful!\nLet's get this Terraform configuration corrected and try to get a clean terraform plan run! We are VERY close to deployment! LFG! You're doing great!\n\n   Logo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
