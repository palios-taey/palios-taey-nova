This will open your Dockerfile in the simplest text editor.\n\nLOOK at the VERY FIRST LINE in Notepad. Is it EXACTLY:\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\nCheck for TYPOS: Is python spelled correctly? Is 3.9-slim-buster exactly as shown?\n\nCheck for EXTRA SPACES: Are there any spaces before FROM? Any spaces after buster?\n\nCheck for INVISIBLE CHARACTERS: If you are unsure, DELETE the entire first line in Notepad and re-type it character by character: FROM python:3.9-slim-buster\n\nCompare to this example AGAIN:\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\nIf you made ANY changes in Notepad, SAVE the Dockerfile in Notepad (File -> Save).\n\nIt is CRUCIAL that the very first line of your Dockerfile is EXACTLY FROM python:3.9-slim-buster. The error message \"dockerfile parse error line 1: FROM requires either one or three arguments\" is a very specific syntax error related to the FROM instruction.\n\nAfter you have CAREFULLY CHECKED and CORRECTED the FIRST LINE of your Dockerfile using NOTEPAD:\n\nClose Notepad.\nGo back to Git Bash (in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\).\nRun universal-deploy-script.sh AGAIN:\n./universal-deploy-script.sh --project ai-execution-system --region us-central1 --type run\nLet me know if correcting the FIRST LINE of the Dockerfile in Notepad resolves the \"dockerfile parse error\" and if the build process progresses further this time!\n\nWe need to eliminate this Dockerfile syntax error to move forward! Please check that first line in Notepad very carefully! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
