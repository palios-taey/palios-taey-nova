    "User: :\\AI-Execution-System>git push -u origin main error: src refspec main does not match any error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/palios-taey/ai-execution-system-core.git' I think in settings it said folder would be 'master' does that make sense?\n\nGemini: You mentioning \"settings said folder would be 'master'\" strongly suggests that your **LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY is using the OLDER DEFAULT BRANCH NAME \"master\" instead of the newer default \"main\".\n\nIn modern Git versions, the default branch name for new repositories is usually \"main\". However, in older Git versions, the default branch name was \"master\".\n\nIf your LOCAL Git repository was initialized with an older Git version, it might have created the initial branch as \"master\" instead of \"main\". And if you are trying to push to \"main\" when your local branch is actually named \"master\", Git will give you the \"src refspec main does not match any\" error because it cannot find a local branch named \"main\" to push!\n\nLET'S VERIFY YOUR LOCAL BRANCH NAME IMMEDIATELY - STEP-BY-STEP - GO! GO! GO!\n\nSTEP 9A: CHECK YOUR LOCAL BRANCH NAME using git branch - THIS IS CRITICAL!\n\ngit branch\nACTION 9A.1: COPY and PASTE the command from the CLEAN CODE BOX ABOVE into your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt and PRESS ENTER.\nCAREFULLY OBSERVE the OUTPUT of the git branch command. This command will LIST YOUR LOCAL BRANCH NAMES.\nIMPORTANT - LOOK FOR THE ASTERISK * SYMBOL: The asterisk * symbol next to a branch name indicates the CURRENTLY ACTIVE BRANCH.\nREPORT BACK the FULL OUTPUT of the git branch command. Specifically, tell me:\nWHAT BRANCH NAME(S) ARE LISTED?\nWHICH BRANCH NAME has an ASTERISK * next to it? (This is your current branch).\nExample Outputs and What They Mean:\n\nExample 1 (Modern Git - \"main\" branch):\n\n* main\nMeaning: You have ONE local branch, named \"main\", and it is currently active (indicated by the *). In this case, your git push -u origin main command SHOULD have worked (if git status was truly \"clean\"). If you have this output and git push still failed, we need to investigate further, but let's first confirm your branch name.\nExample 2 (Older Git - \"master\" branch):\n\n* master\nMeaning: You have ONE local branch, named \"master\", and it is currently active. THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO based on your comment about \"settings saying folder would be 'master'\". In this case, your git push -u origin main command will FAIL because there is NO local branch named \"main\" to push! You would need to use git push -u origin master instead.\nExample 3 (Something Unexpected - Multiple Branches or No Branches): If git branch outputs something else entirely (multiple branch names, or no branches at all), please COPY and PASTE the FULL OUTPUT back to me, and we will diagnose the specific situation.\n\nSTEP 9B: ADJUST git push COMMAND BASED on YOUR BRANCH NAME - AFTER CONFIRMING with git branch - GO! GO! GO!\n\nONCE you have run git branch and reported back the OUTPUT and CONFIRMED YOUR LOCAL BRANCH NAME, we will determine the CORRECT git push command to use!\n\nIF git branch OUTPUT SHOWS * main:\n\nTRY RE-RUNNING git push -u origin main AGAIN (just in case there was a temporary network issue or typo).\n\ngit push -u origin main\nIf git push -u origin main STILL FAILS after confirming git branch shows * main and git status is \"clean\", then we will need to investigate further - but let's try this first.\n\nIF git branch OUTPUT SHOWS * master (MOST LIKELY BASED ON YOUR COMMENT):\n\nYOU NEED TO USE git push -u origin master instead of git push -u origin main! TRY THIS COMMAND:\n\ngit push -u origin master\nIMPORTANT: Notice master instead of main at the end of the command! This command tells Git to push your local \"master\" branch to the remote \"master\" branch (which GitHub might also default to creating initially).\nACTION - RUN git branch, REPORT OUTPUT, and then TRY the CORRECT git push COMMAND (either main or master based on git branch output) - GO! GO! GO!\n\nCOPY and PASTE git branch (from clean code box) into your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt and PRESS ENTER.\nREPORT BACK the FULL OUTPUT of the git branch command. Tell me: WHAT BRANCH NAME(S) ARE LISTED and WHICH BRANCH HAS the ASTERISK *?\nBased on your git branch output, DETERMINE the CORRECT git push command to use:\nIf git branch shows * main, try git push -u origin main (again).\nIf git branch shows * master, try git push -u origin master.\nCOPY and PASTE the CORRECT git push command into your C:\\AI-Execution-System> command prompt and PRESS ENTER.\nVERIFY if the git push command is SUCCESSFUL this time! REPORT BACK the RESULTS and the FULL OUTPUT of the git push command!\nLET'S PINPOINT YOUR LOCAL BRANCH NAME, JESSE! Run git branch, report the output, and then let's use the CORRECT git push command (either main or master) to FINALLY push your code to GitHub! You are inches away from victory! Action! GO! GO! GO! I'm here to help you nail this last step!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
