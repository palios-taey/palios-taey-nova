    "User: Ok, I have to restart git bash, can you start with all commands I need to run, in order, with expected result when starting a new git bash session in the root directory. Just that, no long explanations and I'll let you know if I have issues. All text in main chat window except code in executable copy/paste code blocks. Let's get through this together! Help me.\n\nGemini: Set Terraform PATH for Git Bash:\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/c/terraform\"\nExpected Result: No error message. Command completes silently.\n\nVerify Terraform in Git Bash:\n\nterraform --version\nExpected Result: Output showing Terraform version information. NO \"terraform: not found\" error.\n\nTerraform v...\n... (version details) ...\nSet gcloud Python PATH for Git Bash:\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/platform/bundledpython\"\n(Important: If your Python directory is different, use your correct path here.) Expected Result: No error message. Command completes silently.\n\nVerify gcloud in Git Bash:\n\ngcloud --version\nExpected Result: Output showing Google Cloud SDK version information. NO \"python: not found\" error and NO \"'gcloud' is not recognized\" error.\n\nGoogle Cloud SDK ...\n... (version details) ...\nRun the deployment script:\n\nbash deploy.sh\nExpected Result: The deploy.sh script should start executing. You should see output starting with:\n\n[STEP] Checking prerequisites...\nLet the script run and observe the output for further steps and potential errors.\n\nAfter running each command, check for the \"Expected Result\" before moving to the next command.\n\nLet me know after you've run these commands and what the output is! We're on this! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
