    "User: Ok, so ALL python files, not just those in the main directory need to be included in terraform? What about other executable file types like .json .bat .ts?\n\nGemini: YES, definitely copy these:\n\nALL .py (Python) files that are part of your application's RUNTIME CODE.\nThis includes local_server.py, main.py (if you have one that's part of the application logic), and any other .py files that contain your application's modules, classes, functions, or business logic. Essentially, copy all the .py files that make up the code of your AI Execution System backend. Don't just focus on the \"main\" directory; if your code is spread across multiple directories with .py files, copy them all into the terraform directory (keeping the directory structure if it's important, or flattening them if not - for now, let's just copy them all into terraform directory directly to keep it simple).\nrequirements.txt - You already know this is needed for dependency installation in the Docker image.\nDockerfile - You just created this.\nMAYBE copy these, depending on your application:\n\n.json files: ASK YOURSELF: Does your Python application code NEED to read or use these .json files at RUNTIME when it's deployed in GCP Cloud Functions?\nIf YES: Copy the .json files to the terraform directory. Examples of .json files that might be needed at runtime:\nConfiguration files: If your application loads settings or configurations from .json files when it runs.\nData files: If your application reads data from .json files to perform its tasks.\nIf NO: (or if you are unsure, it's safer to COPY them just in case for now). If the .json files are only for development-time configuration, or documentation, or not used by the deployed application, then you don't strictly need to copy them. But to be safe, if you have any doubt, include them.\nNO, likely do NOT copy these (unless you have a very specific reason):\n\n.bat files: These are Windows Batch scripts. Unless your Python application is designed to execute a .bat file from within the Docker container (which is extremely unlikely for a GCP Cloud Function/Flask app), you do NOT need to copy .bat files. .bat files are for Windows system automation, not typically for application runtime in a Linux-based Docker container in GCP.\n.ts files: These are TypeScript files. TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. Unless you have a very unusual setup where your Python application directly interacts with TypeScript source code (highly unlikely for a backend application deployment like this), you do NOT need to copy .ts files. TypeScript is for frontend web development or Node.js backend development, not typically directly relevant to a Python backend runtime environment in this scenario.\nDocumentation files (e.g., .md, .txt related to documentation): Unless your application is designed to serve documentation files at runtime (again, unlikely for this type of application), you don't need to copy documentation files.\nDevelopment-related files, Git repository files (.git folder, etc.): These are not needed for the runtime application in the Docker image.\nIn short, think about what files your Python code absolutely requires to run correctly when deployed as a GCP Cloud Function/Flask application in a Docker container. Focus on the files that are part of your application's runtime logic and dependencies.\n\nAction Now:\n\nGo to your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai-execution-system-core\\ directory.\nIdentify ALL .py files that constitute your application's backend code. Copy ALL of these .py files to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\.\nLook for .json files in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ai-execution-system-core\\. If you find any .json files and you suspect your application might need them at runtime, copy them to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\. If you are unsure, copy them to be safe.\nDo NOT copy .bat, .ts, documentation, or development/Git related files to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ (unless you have a very specific reason to believe they are essential for runtime).\nAfter copying the necessary Python files, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, and potentially relevant .json files to C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\, re-run bash deploy.sh in Git Bash.\nLet me know what happens after you copy these files and re-run bash deploy.sh! We are really narrowing down the issues and getting closer to a successful deployment! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
