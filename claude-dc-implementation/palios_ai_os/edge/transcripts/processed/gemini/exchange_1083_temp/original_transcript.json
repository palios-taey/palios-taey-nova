    "User: I'm on a Windows machine. I went to the link and it was a repository. I'm not sure what to do.\n\nGemini: Go to the git-filter-repo Releases Page:\n\nOpen your web browser and go to this link: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/releases\n\nLook for \"Standalone Executable\" or \"Windows\" in the latest release:\n\nOn the releases page, look for the latest release (usually at the top).\nScroll down through the \"Assets\" section of the latest release.\nSee if you can find a file that looks like a standalone Windows executable. It might be named something like:\ngit-filter-repo-win64.exe\ngit-filter-repo-windows-standalone.zip\nor similar, containing .exe\nDo you see a file in the \"Assets\" of the latest release that looks like a standalone Windows executable? Tell me what files you see listed under \"Assets\" for the latest release.\n\nIf you can find a .exe file or a .zip containing a .exe file:\n\nIf it's a .zip file: Download the .zip file and extract its contents. You should find a git-filter-repo.exe file inside.\nIf it's a .exe file directly: Download the .exe file.\nOnce you have the git-filter-repo.exe file:\n\nPlace git-filter-repo.exe in a directory that is in your system's PATH environment variable.\n\nEasiest option: Just place git-filter-repo.exe in the same directory where your git.exe is located. To find where git.exe is, you can open a command prompt and type: where git and press Enter. It will show you the path to git.exe. Copy git-filter-repo.exe to that same directory.\nAlternatively (more advanced): You could create a new directory (like C:\\git-filter-repo) and add that directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This is a bit more involved if you are not familiar with environment variables.\nAfter placing git-filter-repo.exe in your PATH, try running it:\n\nOpen a new command prompt (it's important to open a new command prompt so it picks up the PATH changes).\n\nType: git filter-repo --version and press Enter.\n\nIf git-filter-repo is installed correctly, it should print the version of git-filter-repo.\n\nLet me know if you can find a standalone executable on the releases page, download it, and get git filter-repo --version to work in your command prompt. If this method doesn't work, we can explore other options like using pip if you have Python installed.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps\nPrompted\nAttached 1 file.\n- image_b49796.png\n\nDetails\nevent\nFebruary 28 at 7:14\u202fPM\napps\nGemini Apps\nchat\nTags: git-filter-repo, Installation, Windows, No Executable, pip Install\n\nOkay, I see. It looks like for this release, they are only providing the source code archives, not a pre-built Windows executable directly in the \"Assets\". That's not ideal for easy installation on Windows.\n\nThe easiest way to install git-filter-repo on Windows in this case is usually using pip, which is a package installer for Python.\n\nDo you have Python installed on your Windows machine, and are you familiar with using pip (the Python package installer)?\n\nIf you are not sure, open a command prompt and type:\n\npython --version\nand press Enter. Also, type:\n\npip --version\nand press Enter.\n\nTell me the output of these commands.\n\nIf you see Python version information and pip version information, then you likely have both installed and we can use pip to install git-filter-repo.\nIf you get \"command not found\" or errors, it means Python or pip might not be installed, and we'll need to figure out the best way to proceed.\nLet me know about Python and pip, and then I can give you the next steps for installation using pip.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
