    "User: I think so, and then we approved 5 too.\n\nGemini: To be absolutely sure, please just give me a quick confirmation:\n\nJesse, is this 10-point list the correct \"Key Principles for PALIOS-TAEY\" list that we were working on yesterday? (Yes/No or \"Mostly Yes\" if there are minor adjustments needed).\n\nKey Principles for PALIOS-TAEY (List from Yesterday's Discussion - Again for your confirmation):\n\nCharter Alignment: All system actions and outputs must demonstrably align with the PALIOS Charter.\nHuman Oversight & Validation: Critical decisions and system integrations require human validation and oversight.\nSafety & Risk Mitigation: The system must be designed and operated to minimize risks and ensure safety.\nTransparency & Explainability: System processes, especially decision-making, should be transparent and explainable.\nContinuous Learning & Improvement: The system should continuously learn, adapt, and improve over time.\nEthical Operation: The system must operate ethically, considering fairness, bias, and societal impact.\nRobustness & Resilience: The system must be robust and resilient to unexpected inputs and conditions.\nAccountability & Auditability: System actions must be accountable and auditable for review and improvement.\nRespect for Human Values: The system should uphold human values like dignity, autonomy, and well-being.\nEfficiency & Effectiveness: The system should strive for efficiency and effectiveness in achieving its goals, while upholding other principles.\nPlease confirm if this is the correct 10-point list.\n\nOnce you confirm the 10-point list, we can then move on to recalling and confirming the \"Top 5\" from that list that we selected as most interesting for Claude. Let's take it one step at a time to ensure accuracy.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
