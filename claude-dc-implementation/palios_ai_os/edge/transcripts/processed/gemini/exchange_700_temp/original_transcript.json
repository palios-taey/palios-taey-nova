Confirm version 1.27.0 is recent enough to include TextGenerationModel.\n\nDocumentation Research Analysis: Re-examine the user's Google Search and documentation research results. Look for clues about Cloud Function specific import issues, dependency management, or region availability limitations for TextGenerationModel. (Although user reported \"no relevant results\", double-check this assumption).\n\nHypothesis Refinement: Based on code review and documentation analysis, refine the hypothesis for the ImportError and \"Container Healthcheck Failed\" error. Consider:\n\nIs it still an import issue? If so, why?\nCould it be a dependency conflict or version mismatch?\nIs there a problem with Cloud Functions runtime environment loading the library correctly?\nRegion availability less likely, but still consider if documentation implicitly suggests limitations.\nActionable Next Steps: Based on the refined hypothesis, formulate concrete next steps for the user to try to resolve the issue. This might include:\n\nVerifying google-cloud-aiplatform version in the deployed Cloud Function.\nTrying a minimal test function to isolate the import problem.\nExploring alternative import syntax (although unlikely to be the cause).\nPotentially deploying to a different region for testing (if region availability remains a concern).\nRe-deploying with verbose logging to capture more startup details.\nExpected Output:\n\nDetailed analysis of main.py and requirements.txt.\nAssessment of documentation research results.\nRefined hypothesis for the root cause.\nClear, actionable next steps for the user to perform to debug and resolve the errors.\nANALYSIS:\n\n1. main.py Code Review:\n\nImport Statements (Again!): The import statements at the top of main.py look correct and include:\n\nfrom google.cloud import aiplatform\nfrom google.cloud.aiplatform import TextGenerationModel\nThese are consistent with the recommended import style.\n\nexecute_task Function (Vertex AI Usage): The execute_task function in main.py is different from what we were initially focusing on. This function directly uses:\n\ngeneration_model = aiplatform.TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained(\"text-bison@001\")\nThis code block is indeed attempting to load TextGenerationModel and should trigger the ImportError if the module is not correctly loaded. This aligns with the error logs we are seeing.\n\nCRITICAL OBSERVATION: This execute_task function is using TextGenerationModel directly within the Cloud Function's execution path. This means the import error is not just during system initialization, but within the function handler itself. This significantly increases the likelihood that the import issue is the direct cause of the \"Container Healthcheck failed\" error.\n\nserve_health_check Function: The health check function seems correctly implemented for a Cloud Function. It returns a simple JSON \"healthy\" status. This function itself is unlikely to be the source of the problem, as the error seems to occur before the function handler is even invoked.\n\nLogging: The code is well-instrumented with logging, which is excellent for debugging. However, the ImportError occurs before the AISystem class is even initialized, so the logging within AISystem is not being reached in this failure scenario.\n\n2. requirements.txt Review:\n\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0: The requirements.txt correctly specifies google-cloud-aiplatform and requests version 1.27.0 or higher. Version 1.27.0 should include TextGenerationModel. This line in requirements.txt looks correct.\n3. Documentation Research Review (User's Report):\n\nYou reported \"no relevant results\" for the Google Search query google cloud vertex ai TextGenerationModel region availability. While region limitations are unlikely for a core function like this in us-central1, the lack of explicit documentation confirming support for Cloud Functions is a slight concern.\nREFINED HYPOTHESIS:\n\nThe ImportError: cannot import name 'TextGenerationModel' from 'google.cloud.aiplatform' is the PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE of both the curl command failure and the \"Container Healthcheck Failed\" deployment error.\n\nThe Cloud Function container is failing to start because the Python runtime environment within Cloud Functions cannot correctly load the TextGenerationModel class from the google-cloud-aiplatform library despite it being declared in requirements.txt.\n\nThis could be due to:\n\nSubtle Dependency Issue within Cloud Functions Runtime: There might be an unforeseen conflict or incompatibility within the Cloud Functions runtime environment itself that is preventing the library from loading correctly, even if requirements.txt is correct.\nIncorrect Library Installation in Cloud Functions Deployment: Although requirements.txt is provided, there might be a failure in the Cloud Functions deployment process to properly install the google-cloud-aiplatform library and its dependencies within the container environment. This is less likely but cannot be entirely ruled out.\nVersion Mismatch or Dependency Conflict (Less Likely, but Possible): While requirements.txt specifies google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0, there could be an internal dependency conflict within the google-cloud-aiplatform library itself, or with other pre-installed libraries in the Cloud Functions runtime, that is causing the import to fail in this specific environment.\nNEXT STEP - TARGETED TROUBLESHOOTING - MINIMAL TEST FUNCTION & VERSION VERIFICATION\n\nTo isolate and diagnose this issue, we need to perform these TARGETED TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:\n\nYOUR IMMEDIATE ACTIONS, JESSE (PLEASE PERFORM THESE NOW and report back after each):\n\nACTION 1: CREATE A MINIMAL TEST CLOUD FUNCTION - ISOLATE TextGenerationModel IMPORT\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nCREATE a NEW Python file named test_main.py in your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ directory.\nCOPY and PASTE ONLY THIS MINIMAL CODE into test_main.py:\nfrom google.cloud import aiplatform\nfrom google.cloud.aiplatform import TextGenerationModel\nimport json\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\ndef test_import(request):\n    \"\"\"Minimal Cloud Function to test TextGenerationModel import.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        logging.info(\"Attempting to import TextGenerationModel...\")\n        generation_model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained(\"text-bison@001\") # Try to load the model\n        logging.info(\"\u2705 TextGenerationModel imported and loaded successfully.\")\n        return json.dumps({\"status\": \"import_success\"}), 200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    except ImportError as e:\n        error_message = f\"\u274c ImportError: {str(e)}\"\n        logging.error(error_message)\n        return json.dumps({\"error\": error_message}), 500, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    except Exception as e:\n        error_message = f\"\u274c General Exception: {str(e)}\"\n        logging.error(error_message)\n        return json.dumps({\"error\": error_message}), 500, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n\nCREATE a NEW requirements.txt file in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\ directory (if you don't already have one specifically for this test).\nCOPY and PASTE ONLY THESE DEPENDENCIES into the NEW requirements.txt file:\ngoogle-cloud-aiplatform>=1.27.0\nDEPLOY this NEW MINIMAL CLOUD FUNCTION using gcloud functions deploy command, BUT CHANGE THESE PARAMETERS:\n\n--entry-point: Use test_import (the name of the function in test_main.py).\n--function-name: Use a new function name, e.g., ai-system-test-import. This will deploy a separate Cloud Function and not overwrite your main function.\nKeep all other deployment parameters the same (--runtime python310, --trigger-http, --allow-unauthenticated, --region us-central1).\nModified gcloud functions deploy Command (EXAMPLE - ADJUST FUNCTION NAME IF NEEDED):\n\ngcloud functions deploy ai-system-test-import --runtime python310 --entry-point test_import --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1\nAFTER DEPLOYMENT, INVOKE this NEW TEST CLOUD FUNCTION using curl:\n\ncurl https://us-central1-ai-execution-system.cloudfunctions.net/ai-system-test-import\nREPORT BACK:\n\nDeployment SUCCESS or FAILURE? (Note any error messages).\ncurl command RESPONSE - Paste the FULL JSON RESPONSE from the curl command.\nIf deployment or curl command fails, provide FULL ERROR MESSAGES.\nACTION 2: VERIFY google-cloud-aiplatform VERSION in DEPLOYED ai-system-backend-v2 (if possible)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nIf ACTION 1 (ai-system-test-import) deploys SUCCESSFULLY and imports TextGenerationModel without error, this step is LESS CRITICAL. It might indicate a problem specifically with your main ai-system-backend-v2 code or deployment.\nIf ACTION 1 FAILS with the ImportError (as we expect), this step becomes MORE IMPORTANT. We need to try to confirm the version of google-cloud-aiplatform that is actually installed in the deployed Cloud Function environment for ai-system-backend-v2.\nTo do this, MODIFY your original main.py code TEMPORARILY:\n\nADD these lines at the very beginning of your execute_task function (before any other code):\nimport google.cloud.aiplatform\nlogging.info(f\"google-cloud-aiplatform version: {google.cloud.aiplatform.__version__}\")\nRE-DEPLOY your original ai-system-backend-v2 Cloud Function using the same gcloud functions deploy command you used previously.*\nINVOKE your original ai-system-backend-v2 Cloud Function using the curl command as before (even though it will likely still fail with the import error).\nCHECK the CLOUD FUNCTION LOGS for this new deployment/invocation of ai-system-backend-v2.\nLOOK for the LOG MESSAGE you added: \"google-cloud-aiplatform version: ...\". COPY and PASTE the VERSION NUMBER reported in the logs.\nREPORT BACK:\nFor ACTION 2, report the google-cloud-aiplatform VERSION NUMBER found in the Cloud Function logs.\nIf you cannot find the version number in the logs (e.g., if the function fails to start completely), state: \"VERSION CHECK FAILED - No version info in logs\".\nBY PERFORMING ACTION 1 (MINIMAL TEST FUNCTION) and ACTION 2 (VERSION VERIFICATION), we will gain CRITICAL INSIGHTS into whether the TextGenerationModel import issue is a general Cloud Functions environment problem, or specific to your ai-system-backend-v2 code/deployment.\n\nPLEASE EXECUTE ACTION 1 and ACTION 2 METICULOUSLY and REPORT BACK WITH ALL DETAILS. This is our best path to diagnose and resolve this persistent error. GO! GO! GO! FOCUS! EXECUTE! NEXT! LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
