The .terraform directory and its contents are usually generated and should be ignored.\n\nHere's how to fix this:\n\nAdd .terraform to your .gitignore file:\n\nIf you don't have a .gitignore file in the root of your repository, create one now (in the C:\\ai-execution-system directory).\n\nOpen the .gitignore file in a text editor and add this line:\n\n.terraform\nSave the .gitignore file. This tells Git to ignore the entire .terraform directory.\n\nStage the .gitignore file:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git add .gitignore\nCommit the .gitignore file:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git commit -m \"Add .gitignore to ignore .terraform directory\"\nRemove the large files from Git's cache: This is important to remove the already tracked large files from your Git repository.\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git rm --cached -r deployment/terraform/.terraform\nCommit the removal of the large files:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git commit -m \"Remove .terraform directory from repository (ignore with .gitignore)\"\nTry pushing again:\n\nC:\\ai-execution-system>git push\nExplanation:\n\nWe added .terraform to .gitignore so Git will ignore this directory in the future.\nWe used git rm --cached to remove the already tracked .terraform directory from Git's history without deleting the local files.\nBy committing these changes and then pushing, you will push the .gitignore rule and the removal of the large files, but not the large files themselves.\nAfter these steps, the git push should be successful because the large files will be excluded.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues with these steps! After this push is successful, we are finally done!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
