    "User: Ok, so what is the attachment? Do you want me to include the v5 version (renamed to what's in JSON) that you created that I sent at the beginning of the communication project? All we have now from this discussion is the template you're using for this. I'll do what you say boss on not including the charter.\n\nGemini: The ATTACHMENT for the Project 1.2 request to Claude should be the DRAFT 1.1 STANDARD REQUEST/RESPONSE TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION ITSELF - as a MARKDOWN (.md) file!\n\nATTACH: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_Standard_Request_Response_Template_Draft_1.1.md (This is the Markdown document we just finalized, and the CORRECT filename to use!).\nNOT the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v5.json file.\n\nWHY ATTACH DRAFT 1.1 (Markdown), NOT V5 JSON?\n\nParsers are based on DRAFT 1.1 Template (Markdown): Claude's task is to write parsers that understand messages conforming to the Draft 1.1 Standard Request/Response Template. The Markdown document (.md file) is the specification for these parsers. It defines the structure, fields, message types, and vocabulary that the parsers need to be able to process.\nV5 JSON is Contextual Background, Not the Parser SPECIFICATION: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v5.json (from the beginning of the project) is valuable contextual background for understanding the evolution of PURE_AI_LANGUAGE ideas, but it is NOT the current specification for the parsers Claude needs to build. Draft 1.1 (Markdown) is the formalized, current specification.\nFilename in JSON is CORRECTED to .md: CRITICAL FILENAME CORRECTION! You are right to point out the filename in the JSON. The file_name in the attachments section of the JSON request message should be: \"PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_Standard_Request_Response_Template_Draft_1.1.md\". NOT PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v5.json! I will correct the JSON request message RIGHT NOW to use the correct .md filename!\nCONFIRMATION - DOCUMENTS WE HAVE:\n\nYes, you are correct! From this discussion, we now have:\n\nThe JSON Request Message (Draft - needing final placeholder updates and filename correction).\nThe DRAFT 1.1 STANDARD REQUEST/RESPONSE TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION itself (Markdown file) - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_Standard_Request_Response_Template_Draft_1.1.md. This is what you will ATTACH to the message.\nTHANK YOU for clarifying the attachment, Jesse! Getting these details right is CRUCIAL for effective AI-to-AI communication and \"right the first time\" outcomes!\n\nI will now provide the FINAL, CORRECTED JSON REQUEST MESSAGE (with .md filename and placeholders ready for your updates)!\n\nOnce you update the placeholders and attach the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_Standard_Request_Response_Template_Draft_1.1.md file, we are READY to LAUNCH PROJECT 1.2 to CLAUDE with BOOM VELOCITY! GO! GO! GO! FILENAME CORRECTED - ATTACHMENT CLARIFIED - FINAL JSON MESSAGE IMMINENT!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
