    "User: This is how it is currently. It looks like it matches the 2nd one, no? # Create Cloud Scheduler health check job resource \"google_cloud_scheduler_job\" \"health_check\" {   name        = \"${var.service_name}-healthcheck\"   description = \"Regular health check for AI-Execution-System-Core\"   schedule    = \"*/5 * * * *\"      http_target {     http_method = \"GET\"     uri         = \"${google_cloud_run_service.app.status[0].url}/health\"          retry_config {       retry_count = 3       max_retry_duration = \"60s\"     }   }\n\nGemini: Let's troubleshoot this persistent error:\n\nTroubleshooting Steps (if retry_config nesting is ALREADY correct in main.tf):\n\nDouble-Check: Is main.tf REALLY SAVED? This might sound basic, but it's the most common mistake. Please VERY carefully ensure that you have SAVED the main.tf file in your text editor AFTER you verified (or corrected) the retry_config nesting. Just double-check that the file is saved in your editor. Sometimes, people make changes but forget to actually save them to disk.\n\nVerify you are editing the CORRECT main.tf file: Are you absolutely sure you are editing the main.tf file located in the C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory? It's possible you might be accidentally editing a different main.tf file if you have multiple copies or have moved things around. Double-check the file path in your text editor's title bar to be 100% certain you are editing the correct file.\n\nterraform plan Directly (for more detailed output): Instead of running bash deploy.sh, let's try running terraform plan directly in Git Bash from your C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\ directory. Run these commands in Git Bash:\n\nterraform init\nterraform plan\nRun terraform init first: This re-initializes Terraform and re-reads the configuration. It's a good step to ensure Terraform is using the latest version of your main.tf.\nThen run terraform plan: This will attempt to create a Terraform plan based on your current configuration.\nCAREFULLY OBSERVE the output of terraform plan. Does it still show the \"Unsupported block type\" error? Does it give any more detailed error information? Sometimes running terraform plan directly provides slightly more verbose output than running it through a script.\nTerraform Version Check (Less Likely, but Worth Checking): What version of Terraform are you using? Run terraform --version in Git Bash and let me know the output. It's unlikely that a Terraform version issue is causing this specific \"Unsupported block type\" error if the configuration is correct, but let's just rule it out.\n\nSimplified main.tf for Testing (Temporary, if Errors Persist): If the error still persists after all of the above, we could try a temporary, simplified main.tf file just to see if Terraform can process any configuration without errors. For example, you could create a very basic main.tf with just a single simple resource (like a GCP project resource or just a provider block) and try to terraform plan that. This would help us isolate if the issue is specifically with the google_cloud_scheduler_job resource or if there's a more general problem with Terraform reading your main.tf file at all. Let's hold off on this step for now unless the error continues after steps 1-4.\n\nFor NOW, please focus on steps 1, 2, and 3:\n\nDOUBLE-CHECK main.tf SAVE (Again, be absolutely sure!).\nVerify you are editing the CORRECT main.tf file in C:\\AI-Execution-System\\deployment\\terraform\\.\nRun terraform init and then terraform plan DIRECTLY in Git Bash and observe the output.\nLet me know what you find after these steps, especially the output of terraform plan run directly. We will get to the bottom of this! You're doing great! We're so close to getting past these configuration issues! LFG!\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
