Follow these prompts carefully. This usually involves:\nSelecting your GitHub account.\nChoosing which organization or repositories Cloud Build can access. Make sure you grant access to your ai-execution-system repository.\nApproving the Cloud Build GitHub App permissions.\n[REPOSITORY_SELECTION_TAG] Select your Repository: After authorization, you'll likely be presented with a list of your GitHub repositories. Choose your ai-execution-system repository from this list to connect it to Cloud Build.\n[REASSURANCE_TAG] You're on the right track! Using the \"Connect repository\" button is the correct and expected way to begin linking your GitHub repository to Cloud Build. It's the foundation for setting up the automated build and deployment pipeline.\n\nOnce you've clicked \"Connect repository\" and gone through the authorization flow, let me know! We can then proceed to the next steps in creating the trigger and configuring the cloudbuild.yaml file to complete the GitHub sync setup.\n\nLogo for Gemini Apps\nGemini Apps"
