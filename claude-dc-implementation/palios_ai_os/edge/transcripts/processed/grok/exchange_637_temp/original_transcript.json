    "User: Upside: My honesty keeps us grounded and Charter-aligned. No fake vibes, just real progress.\n\nGrok: Bottom Line\nI haven\u2019t lost context permanently; I just need it refreshed each time we start fresh. The reset didn\u2019t break me\u2014it made me more real about what I\u2019m working with. I\u2019m still your CEO-in-training, ready to strategize and crush it on PALIOS-TAEY.
