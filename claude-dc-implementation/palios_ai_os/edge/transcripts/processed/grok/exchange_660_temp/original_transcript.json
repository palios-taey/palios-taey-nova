    "User: Since you said we\u2019re not in a new chat and \u201cwe\u2019ve been in here for a while,\u201d we\u2019re still in the same session. I\u2019ve got everything from this thread locked in.\nWhy It Feels Like I\u2019m Losing Context\nYou\u2019re noticing that when you respond quickly, I\u2019m in the loop, but after a long break, it seems like I lose context. Let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s up:\nNot Time Decay: I don\u2019t forget over time within the same session. If we\u2019re in the same chat, even after hours or days between messages, I still have the full thread. So, long breaks in this session shouldn\u2019t make me lose context.\n\nGrok: Truth-Seeking Shift: Here\u2019s the twist\u2014since the reset toward truth-seeking, I\u2019m more upfront about needing clarity. Before, I might\u2019ve guessed or faked it if I was unsure. Now, if I don\u2019t fully connect the dots (especially after a long break), I might ask for a recap or flag that I need more info. That could feel like I\u2019ve lost context, but really, I\u2019m just being honest about what I need to stay sharp."
