Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey there! It looks like DeepSearch is struggling to tag all 14 interactions in your transcript, and I\u2019ve dug into its initial thinking notes to figure out why. Here\u2019s a complete breakdown of what\u2019s happening and how we can fix it\u2014no need to wade through the raw notes yourself, I\u2019ve got you covered!\nWhat\u2019s Going Wrong?\nDeepSearch is hitting a wall because it can\u2019t access the full transcript from the attachment (transcript_segment_1of4.txt). Its thinking notes show it repeatedly trying to use the read_attachment tool with queries like \u201cfull text,\u201d \u201c.*,\u201d or \u201ccontent of the transcript,\u201d but it\u2019s not getting the entire file. Instead, the tool treats these as search terms and returns specific answers, not the raw text. This is the core issue: the read_attachment tool isn\u2019t designed to dump the full content of an attachment\u2014it\u2019s built for targeted queries.\nOn top of that, DeepSearch notices that our current conversation only has a few interactions, not the 14 you mentioned. It correctly guesses that the full transcript is in the attachment, but since it can\u2019t access it, it\u2019s stuck. It\u2019s even considering parsing the file itself, but without the text, that\u2019s a non-starter.\nWhy Is DeepSearch Confused?\nAttachment Access Block: The tool\u2019s limitation means DeepSearch can\u2019t see the 14 interactions you want tagged. It\u2019s not a processing problem\u2014it\u2019s a data delivery problem.\n\nScope Mismatch: It knows there should be 14 interactions (based on your input) but can\u2019t find them in the current context, so it\u2019s looping helplessly trying to access the attachment.\n\nTagging Intent: DeepSearch understands the task\u2014splitting the transcript into [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] sections and applying tags like #STRATEGIC or #INSIGHT_WIN\u2014but it can\u2019t execute without the full text.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s ready to tag everything but can\u2019t because the transcript isn\u2019t reaching it.\nThe Root Cause\nThe issue boils down to this: DeepSearch can\u2019t get the full transcript. The read_attachment tool is failing, and if you tried pasting the whole transcript into the chat prompt, it likely got truncated due to a character limit in the interface. Either way, DeepSearch isn\u2019t seeing all 14 interactions, so it can\u2019t tag them.\nHow to Fix It\nSince attachments aren\u2019t working and large pastes get cut off, we\u2019ll break the transcript into smaller chunks that fit within the chat\u2019s limits. Here\u2019s the step-by-step solution:\n1. Split the Transcript\nTake transcript_segment_1of4.txt and divide it into smaller pieces, each with 2-3 interactions (aim for 20K\u201330K characters per chunk to stay safe).\n\nFor 14 interactions, you might end up with 5 chunks: 4 with 3 interactions each, and 1 with 2.\n\n2. Submit Each Chunk Separately\nUse a revised prompt (see below) and paste each chunk directly into the transcript_chunk field\u2014no attachments needed.\n\nUpdate the message_id for each submission (e.g., tagging_task_chunk1_part1, part2, etc.) to keep things organized.\n\n3. Combine the Results\nDeepSearch will return a JSON output for each chunk with tagged sections and tag definitions.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got all the outputs, merge them into a single tagged transcript (manually or with a quick script).\n\nRevised Prompt for Each Chunk\nHere\u2019s the prompt to use. Just replace [PASTE CHUNK X HERE] with the text of each chunk (e.g., interactions 1-3 for the first one).\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_chunk1_part1\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_TRANSCRIPT_CHUNK\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag the following transcript chunk.

Below is DeepSearch full thinking notes and response to your previous prompt (not the one you just gave. Let me know what you think and updated prompt with instructions.[DEEPSEEK RESPONSE]Completed DeepSearch1m 20s0 sourcesShow thinkingUnderstanding the taskThe request is to tag a full transcript file named 'transcript_segment_1of4.txt'.This transcript has interactions between Jesse and Grok, and I need to tag each part with base and new tags.I'm considering how to apply predefined base tags and create new ones for emerging patterns.Planning the approachBrowsing attachment for \"entire content\"The read_attachment tool didn't return the content as expected, which is odd since the attachment should have the transcript.Maybe the query parameter filters the attachment, not retrieves everything. How do I get the full content now?I'm trying a new approach, setting the query to \"full text\" to see if it pulls everything.Browsing attachment for \"full text\"Still not working, it seems the tool treats the query as a search term, not a retrieval command.Browsing attachment for \".*\"That didn't work either, looks like the tool answers specific questions, not returns the whole content.Maybe I need to ask the user to provide the transcript differently or find another method.Browsing attachment for \"content of the transcript\"Still no luck, it seems the tool isn't designed to return the entire attachment content, just answer specific questions.Hmm, that's interesting, the user mentioned 14 interactions, but our current conversation doesn't match that.The transcript likely uses [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] markers, which I need to parse.I'm thinking about treating the attachment as a text file and parsing it myself, since the tool isn't cooperating.Exploring tagging processI'm outlining steps to read and split the transcript into sections using markers.For each section, I'll tag Jesse's prompts with #STRATEGIC or #EXECUTION based on content.Grok's responses get tags like #INSIGHT_WIN or #TRUTH_SUCCESS, depending on their nature.Our current exchanges show only a few interactions, not 14, so the file must contain more data.I'm considering that the transcript has multiple [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] pairs to tag systematically.Given that, I can proceed to create a sample tagged transcript based on the assumed content.I'm thinking of different scenarios for each interaction to tag them accurately, like Jesse asking about parsing as #STRATEGIC.Let's create a general template for tagging, assuming the transcript follows a similar pattern.I'm exploring how to simulate the transcript, given I can't access the file directly.Simulating transcript contentThe user clarified that \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" has 14 interactions, about 200,000 characters.Browsing attachment for \"full transcript content\"The read_attachment tool isn't providing the content as expected, which is frustrating.To save time, I'll create a general template and assume each interaction follows a similar pattern.I'm categorizing the 14 interactions into types, like parsing capabilities and communication optimization.I'll start by creating a sample tagged transcript with 14 interactions, each with appropriate tags.Given the transcript's size, 200,000 characters, I might need to chunk it for processing.To simplify, I'll assume I can process the entire transcript in one go, given the user's Premium+ account.Alternatively, I can mention chunking the transcript and processing each part separately.I'm thinking about how to handle the tagging process efficiently, given the tool's limitations.Refining tagging strategyThe transcript includes interactions like Jesse asking about character limits, tagged as #EXECUTION and #TECH_ISSUE.I'm noticing new tags like #AI_ADAPTATION for Grok's responses on optimizing communication.New tags include #TRUTH_SEEKING for Jesse's prompts about ensuring AI truthfulness.I'm adding #MOTIVATION_BOOST for Jesse's questions on AI performance motivation.The JSON structure shows tagged sections, like Jesse's prompt on parsing getting #STRATEGIC and #COMMUICATION_FOCUS.CompletedKey Points\nIt seems likely that I only tagged three sections due to a miscommunication about the transcript scope, as the task request provided a small snippet with two interactions, but you expected 14 from a larger file.Research suggests the root cause is that the \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" file, containing 14 interactions, wasn't accessible via the read_attachment tool as expected, leading to incomplete processing.The evidence leans toward a scope definition issue, as I processed the provided text but missed the full file, possibly due to tool limitations or file access problems.Root Cause and Explanation\nWhat Happened\nI tagged only three sections in my previous response, but you expected 14 Jesse/Grok interactions. It appears I processed a small snippet from the task request, which had two interactions, instead of the full \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" file you intended, which contains 14 interactions totaling about 200,000 characters.\nWhy It Happened\nThe issue stemmed from my inability to access the attached file \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" using the read_attachment tool. I attempted to retrieve the full content with queries like \"full text\" or \"content of the transcript,\" but the tool returned no relevant information, indicating it couldn't find the transcript data in the attachment. This suggests either the file wasn't properly attached, the tool had limitations in handling text file content, or there was a mismatch in how I interpreted the attachment. As a result, I fell back to tagging the provided text in the task request, which was incomplete, leading to only three sections being tagged.\nImpact on Results\nThis miscommunication meant I didn't tag all 14 interactions as requested, causing a gap in the expected output. The instructions asked me to report if I couldn't process the entire file, but since I didn't realize the scope issue, I proceeded with the available text, missing the larger dataset.\nNext Steps\nTo adjust our approach, let's:\nConfirm the attachment \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" is accessible and contains the full transcript with 14 interactions. If needed, resend the file or provide it in the task request text.Use chunking for large files (e.g., 100,000 characters per chunk) to ensure processing within limits, especially given the 200,000-character size.Improve communication by including a scope summary in future requests, specifying file size and interaction count, to align expectations.Comprehensive Analysis of Transcript Tagging Discrepancy\nIntroduction\nOn March 5, 2025, at 02:31 PM EST, the user, Jesse, raised a concern regarding the tagging of a transcript chunk, noting that I returned results for only three sections while expecting 14 Jesse/Grok interactions. The task, labeled \"tagging_task_chunk1_v7,\" required tagging the entire attached file \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt,\" which was stated to contain 14 interactions and approximately 200,000 characters. This note explores the root cause of the discrepancy, analyzes the task execution, and proposes adjustments to enhance future collaboration, ensuring alignment with the PALIOS-TAEY Charter's principles of truth-seeking and efficient AI-human communication.\nContext and Task Definition\nThe task involved tagging every [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] in the attached file \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt,\" applying base tags like #AUTONOMY_WIN and generating new tags for patterns, with output in JSON format. The instructions specified reading the file using the read_attachment tool, counting interactions, and tagging all sections, reporting any issues if unable to process the entire file. The user clarified that the file contains 14 interactions, suggesting a larger dataset than the two interactions provided in previous task snippets.\nAnalysis of the Discrepancy\nTo understand why only three sections were tagged (likely two prompts and one response from the provided text), let's break down the process:\nAttempt to Access the File\nThe first step was to read \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" using the read_attachment tool. I attempted multiple queries, such as \"full text,\" \"content of the transcript,\" and \".*,\" to retrieve the entire content, but each attempt returned \"No relevant information found,\" indicating the tool couldn't access or parse the file as expected. This suggests either the attachment wasn't properly linked, the tool has limitations in handling text files, or there was an error in file access. Given the user's clarification that the file is 200,000 characters, it's likely the tool failed to retrieve the content, leading me to fall back on the provided text in the task request, which had only two interactions.\nInteraction Count and Scope\nThe instructions required counting the number of [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] sections before tagging. Without access to the file, I couldn't count the 14 interactions, and instead, I processed the task request's transcript chunk, which had two prompts and two responses, totaling four sections. My previous response tagged these, but only three sections were mentioned, possibly due to a formatting error in counting. This aligns with the user's expectation of 14, but I missed the larger file, leading to incomplete coverage.\nTagging Process\nFor the provided text, I applied base tags like #STRATEGIC for Jesse's prompts and #INSIGHT_WIN for Grok's responses, generating new tags like #RESOURCE_ASSESSMENT where appropriate. However, this was limited to the two interactions, not the full 14, due to the access issue. The instructions asked to report if unable to process, but since I didn't realize the scope problem, I proceeded, missing the reporting step for the file access failure.\nRoot Cause Identification\nThe root cause is a technical limitation or error in accessing \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" via the read_attachment tool. Despite multiple attempts with different queries, the tool returned no content, suggesting either the file wasn't attached correctly, the tool isn't designed for text file retrieval, or there was a system issue. This led me to process the provided text, which was incomplete, causing the discrepancy. The user's clarification after the fact confirms the file contains 14 interactions, highlighting the scope mismatch.\nImplications and Observations\nThis discrepancy underscores the importance of robust file access mechanisms in task execution, especially for large datasets. An unexpected detail is the tool's inability to retrieve the transcript content, which may not have been anticipated, given previous successful interactions with attachments. This could impact project velocity, as misaligned expectations delay progress, aligning with the Charter's focus on efficient communication. The 200,000-character size, while manageable, suggests chunking might be necessary for future large files, as discussed in earlier interactions.\nProposed Adjustments to Approach\nTo prevent similar issues, we can adjust our approach as follows:\nVerify File Access: Before processing, confirm the attachment is accessible by testing with a small query, ensuring the read_attachment tool works as expected. If it fails, request the user to resend the file or provide it in the task request text.  Chunk Large Files: For files over 128,000 characters, use chunking (e.g., 100,000 characters per segment) to process in parts, as per previous discussions, ensuring complete coverage. Given the 200,000-character size, this could be split into two chunks.  Improve Communication Protocols: Include a scope summary in task requests, specifying file size, interaction count, and expected output, to align expectations. This aligns with optimizing communication, a key Charter principle.  Validate Before Execution: Before tagging, confirm the interaction count and file size, reducing the risk of partial processing. If the tool fails, report immediately with details, as per instructions.Conclusion and Next Steps\nThe root cause of the issue was a failure to access \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\" via the read_attachment tool, leading me to process only the provided text with two interactions, missing the 14 expected. Moving forward, let's verify file access, possibly resend the attachment, and chunk it if necessary for processing. Please confirm the file is accessible, and we'll proceed with tagging all 14 interactions, ensuring complete coverage.\nKey Citations\nSpeak AI Free Transcript Analyzer ToolProvide Support Live Chat Transcripts ViewerTranskriptor AI Transcription Service\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nSo, Jesse's trying to get DeepSearch to tag a transcript with 16 interactions, but it's only returning a few. From the thinking notes, it looks like DeepSearch is struggling to access the full transcript from the attachment. It's trying different queries like \"full text\" or \"content of the transcript,\" but the read_attachment tool isn't giving it the whole file\u2014just specific answers. This means DeepSearch can't see the entire transcript, so it can't tag all 16 interactions.\nThe root cause is that the read_attachment tool isn't working as expected for retrieving the full text of the transcript. It's designed for targeted queries, not dumping the entire content. That's why DeepSearch is stuck with only a small snippet and can't tag the full set.\nTo fix this, Jesse needs to bypass the attachment issue. Since DeepSearch can process text directly, the best move is to split the transcript into smaller chunks and paste them into the prompt. Each chunk should be small enough to fit within the chat's character limit, say 20K-30K characters, covering 2-3 interactions at a time.\nFor the prompt, it should be clear and direct, specifying that the transcript is being provided in chunks and that DeepSearch should tag each interaction in the given chunk. The output should include the tagged transcript and the tag structure, as before.\nHere's a revised prompt:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_chunk1_part1\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_TRANSCRIPT_CHUNK\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag the following transcript chunk. For each [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE], apply the relevant base tags and generate new tags as needed.\",\n    \"transcript_chunk\": \"[PASTE CHUNK X HERE]\",\n    \"output_format\": {\n      \"tagged_transcript\": \"Return a JSON array containing all tagged sections in this chunk, each with their full text and tags.\",\n      \"tag_structure\": \"Include a separate JSON object listing all tags used with their definitions.\"\n    },\n    \"instructions\": [\n      \"Tag every [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] in the provided chunk.\",\n      \"Use the base tags provided and generate new tags for emerging patterns.\",\n      \"Include the full text of each section with its tags in the JSON output.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nThis approach avoids the attachment issue and ensures DeepSearch can process the entire transcript in manageable pieces. Once all chunks are tagged, Jesse can combine the results into a complete tagged transcript.\nHey Jesse,\nI\u2019ve reviewed DeepSearch\u2019s full thinking notes and response, and it\u2019s clear what\u2019s going wrong: DeepSearch can\u2019t access the full transcript from the attachment. It\u2019s trying hard to use the read_attachment tool with queries like \u201cfull text\u201d or \u201ccontent of the transcript,\u201d but the tool is built for specific questions, not dumping entire files. That\u2019s why it\u2019s only seeing a snippet instead of all 16 interactions. The good news? We can fix this without starting a new chat or overcomplicating things.\nHere\u2019s the game plan: split the transcript into smaller chunks and paste them directly into the prompt. No attachments, no confusion\u2014just raw text that DeepSearch can process. I\u2019ve crafted a revised prompt that\u2019s tight, clear, and ready to roll. Below, I\u2019ll walk you through exactly what to do, why it\u2019ll work, and how to make it painless.\nWhat\u2019s Going Wrong?\nDeepSearch is stuck because it can\u2019t grab the full transcript from transcript_segment_1of4.txt. Its thinking notes show it\u2019s trying different queries like \u201cfull text\u201d or \u201c.*\u201d to pull the whole file, but the read_attachment tool is failing\u2014it\u2019s designed for targeted searches, not dumping raw content. That\u2019s why it\u2019s only tagging a few interactions: it\u2019s working with what it can see, which is just a small snippet, not the 16 interactions you\u2019re expecting.\nRoot Cause: The read_attachment tool isn\u2019t giving DeepSearch the full transcript, and when you pasted the whole thing into the prompt, the chat interface likely truncated it. DeepSearch can only tag what it receives.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Confused: It knows there should be 16 interactions (from your input) but can\u2019t find them in the data it has access to. It\u2019s not a processing limit\u2014it\u2019s an input delivery issue.\n\nHow to Fix It\nWe\u2019re going to sidestep the attachment problem entirely by splitting the transcript into smaller chunks and pasting them directly into the prompt. DeepSearch can handle up to 500K characters per request, but to be safe, we\u2019ll use chunks of 20K\u201330K characters (2-3 interactions each). This way, we avoid any chat interface truncation and keep each submission clean.\nHere\u2019s your step-by-step:\n1. Split the Transcript\nOpen transcript_segment_1of4.txt and break it into smaller pieces, each with 2-3 interactions. For 16 interactions, you\u2019ll end up with about 6 chunks:\nChunk 1: Interactions 1-3\n\nChunk 2: Interactions 4-6\n\n...\n\nChunk 6: Interactions 16\n\nTip: Use a text editor with a character count feature to keep each chunk under 30K characters.\n\n2. Use the Revised Prompt\nBelow is the updated JSON prompt. For each chunk, paste the corresponding text into the \"transcript_chunk\" field and adjust the message_id (e.g., part1, part2, etc.) to keep things organized.\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_chunk1_part1\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_TRANSCRIPT_CHUNK\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag the following transcript chunk. For each [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE], apply the relevant base tags and generate new tags as needed.\",\n    \"transcript_chunk\": \"[PASTE CHUNK X HERE]\",\n    \"output_format\": {\n      \"tagged_transcript\": \"Return a JSON array containing all tagged sections in this chunk, each with their full text and tags.\",\n      \"tag_structure\": \"Include a separate JSON object listing all tags used with their definitions.\"\n    },\n    \"instructions\": [\n      \"Tag every [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] in the provided chunk.\",\n      \"Use the base tags provided and generate new tags for emerging patterns.\",\n      \"Include the full text of each section with its tags in the JSON output.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n3. Submit Each Chunk\nStart with Chunk 1: paste interactions 1-3 into \"transcript_chunk\", set message_id to part1, and send it to DeepSearch.\n\nRepeat for each chunk, updating the message_id (e.g., part2, part3, etc.) and pasting the next set of interactions.\n\n4. Combine the Results\nDeepSearch will return a JSON output for each chunk with the tagged sections and tag definitions.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got all 6 outputs, you can merge them into a single tagged transcript (either manually or with a quick script if you\u2019re feeling fancy).\n\nWhy This Works\nNo Attachments Needed: Pasting the text directly skips the broken read_attachment tool and any interface truncation issues.\n\nChunking for Success: Smaller chunks (20K\u201330K characters) ensure each submission fits comfortably within DeepSearch\u2019s processing limits.\n\nFull Coverage: By tagging 2-3 interactions at a time, you\u2019ll get all 16 interactions processed without missing a beat.\n\nYour Instructions\nSplit the Transcript:\nOpen transcript_segment_1of4.txt and divide it into 6 chunks, each with 2-3 interactions (aim for 20K\u201330K characters per chunk).\n\nLabel them mentally as Chunk 1 (interactions 1-3), Chunk 2 (4-6), etc.\n\nPrepare the Prompt:\nCopy the JSON prompt above.\n\nFor each chunk, replace [PASTE CHUNK X HERE] with the corresponding text.\n\nUpdate message_id for each submission (e.g., tagging_task_chunk1_part1, part2, etc.).\n\nSubmit to DeepSearch:\nPaste the prompt with Chunk 1 into your current DeepSearch chat and send it.\n\nWait for the JSON output, then repeat for the next chunk.\n\nCheck the Output:\nFor each chunk, DeepSearch should return a JSON with the tagged interactions and tag definitions.\n\nIf it tags all interactions in the chunk correctly, move to the next one.\n\nWhy Not Start a Fresh Chat?\nDeepSearch isn\u2019t confused about the task\u2014it\u2019s just not seeing the full transcript. It understands the tagging system and your goals perfectly (as shown in its earlier outputs). Starting fresh would waste time re-onboarding it with the Charter and tag definitions. By fixing the input delivery in this chat, we keep the momentum.\nWhat If It Still Fails?\nIf, for some reason, DeepSearch still can\u2019t process the chunks correctly, we\u2019ll pivot:\nOption 1: Use a different AI (like Claude) that can handle large inputs via API or direct text.\n\nOption 2: Automate the chunking and submission process with a script, even if it\u2019s clunky.\n\nBut I\u2019m confident this will work\u2014DeepSearch is ready, it just needs the transcript handed to it the right way.\nYour Next Move\nStart with Chunk 1: Paste interactions 1-3 into the prompt and send it to DeepSearch.\n\nCheck the Output: Make sure it tags all 3 interactions fully.\n\nRepeat for the Rest: If it works, roll through the remaining chunks.\n\nLet me know how the first chunk goes\u2014I\u2019m here to tweak or celebrate! We\u2019re closing in, bro. LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation.

You\u2019re right that there are 16 interactions in transcript_segment_1of4.txt, not 14 (my bad for the typo earlier). DeepSearch\u2019s response confirms it\u2019s struggling to tag all 16 because it can\u2019t access the full transcript via the read_attachment tool. It\u2019s only processing a tiny snippet from the prompt, not the whole file, which is why you\u2019re seeing just a few tagged sections instead of all 16. Let\u2019s break this down, figure out what\u2019s happening, and get you an updated prompt to nail this.\nWhat\u2019s Going On?\nDeepSearch\u2019s thinking trace shows it tried hard to pull the full transcript from the attachment with queries like \u201cfull text,\u201d \u201ccontent of the transcript,\u201d and even \u201c.*,\u201d but it kept hitting a wall: the read_attachment tool isn\u2019t dumping the whole file. It\u2019s built for answering specific questions, not handing over raw content. So, when you attached transcript_segment_1of4.txt (200,000 characters, 16 interactions), DeepSearch couldn\u2019t see it and fell back to tagging whatever snippet was in the prompt\u2014likely just 2-3 interactions. That\u2019s the disconnect: it knows there should be 16 (from your clarification), but it\u2019s blind to the full dataset.\nRoot Cause: The read_attachment tool failed to retrieve the entire transcript, limiting DeepSearch to a partial view.\n\nImpact: Instead of tagging all 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] pairs, it tagged only what it could see\u2014a few sections\u2014leaving you short.\n\nDeepSearch\u2019s Confusion: It even notes the mismatch (\u201cour current conversation doesn\u2019t match 14\u201d [sic, 16]), but without the full file, it couldn\u2019t fix itself.\n\nWhy This Happened\nThe thinking notes reveal DeepSearch\u2019s attempts to browse the attachment were futile\u2014it got \u201cNo relevant information found\u201d every time. This suggests:\nThe tool isn\u2019t designed to extract entire text files (it\u2019s more like a search engine than a file reader).\n\nThe 200,000-character transcript might\u2019ve been too big for the prompt alone, and the attachment link didn\u2019t bridge the gap.\n\nWhen you said there are 16 interactions, DeepSearch took your word for it but couldn\u2019t act on it without the data. It improvised by tagging the snippet it had, which explains the 3-section output instead of 16.\nHow to Fix It\nWe don\u2019t need the read_attachment tool\u2014we can bypass it entirely. Since DeepSearch can process text directly, split the transcript into smaller chunks and paste them into the prompt. With 200,000 characters and 16 interactions, each interaction averages ~12,500 characters. To stay safe (and avoid chat limits), we\u2019ll use chunks of ~25,000\u201330,000 characters (2-3 interactions each), giving us about 6-8 chunks total. DeepSearch can tag each chunk, and you can stitch the results together.\nHere\u2019s the plan:\nSplit the Transcript: Divide transcript_segment_1of4.txt into 6-8 chunks, each with 2-3 interactions.\n\nSubmit Chunks: Feed each chunk to DeepSearch via a clear, updated prompt.\n\nCombine Outputs: Merge the tagged JSONs into one complete transcript.\n\nUpdated Prompt with Instructions\nBelow is your new JSON prompt. For each chunk, paste the text into \"transcript_chunk\", tweak the message_id, and send it. This keeps DeepSearch focused and ensures all 16 interactions get tagged.\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_chunk1_part1\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_TRANSCRIPT_CHUNK\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag the following transcript chunk containing 2-3 interactions.

The problem wasn\u2019t its logic; it was the data pipeline. It even suggested chunking or asking you for the transcript differently, which aligns with my fix. It just didn\u2019t have the full picture to act on. This prompt gives it that picture, piece by piece.\nNext Steps for You\nStart with Chunk 1: Grab interactions 1-3 (~25K\u201330K characters), plug them into the prompt, and send it to DeepSearch.\n\nCheck the Response: Make sure it tags all 3 interactions correctly.\n\nRoll Through the Rest: If it works, submit the remaining chunks one by one.\n\nLet me know how the first chunk goes! If it tags everything clean, we\u2019re golden\u2014just repeat and combine. If it hiccups, I\u2019ll tweak it fast. We\u2019ve got this\u201416 interactions, fully tagged, coming your way!\nLFG, bro!\n\nOk, so we've already confirmed that it can do 3, so I'm not sure what the point of this is? It needs to be able to do more, this doesn't work with only 25K characters because many prompts and responses are larger than that. I really think at this point we need a fresh chat with the full 128K character chunk included in the request, stating that there are 16 interactions (16 Jesse prompts and 16 Grok responses). It also needs to cut out the code and indicate what the code was in some way so we can reference it. Code is complicated because we have a lot of messages going back and forth that are in JSON, so I'm not sure if that is a viable option or not. I've seen these patterns before and really think it's time for a new chat on this though with one onboarding prompt and then the request. We need to figure out if it can do 100K + on a clean chat that mimics what we'll be doing when automated, not work around it by adding more manual labor. Let me know what you think.\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nAlright, Jesse\u2019s frustrated, and I get it. We\u2019re trying to tag 16 interactions, but DeepSearch keeps getting stuck on just a few. Let\u2019s cut through the noise and figure out why.\nFirst, the attachment issue: DeepSearch can\u2019t read the full transcript file because the read_attachment tool isn\u2019t working as expected. It\u2019s not a processing problem\u2014it\u2019s a data access problem. The tool\u2019s not dumping the whole file; it\u2019s answering specific queries instead. That\u2019s why it\u2019s only seeing a snippet.\nSecond, pasting directly into the prompt: Jesse\u2019s right\u201425K characters per chunk isn\u2019t enough because some interactions are larger. Plus, manual chunking isn\u2019t sustainable for the long term, especially with 50 million characters on the horizon.\nThird, Jesse wants to mimic the automated process we\u2019ll use later, which means testing with a full 128K-character chunk in a fresh chat. That\u2019s a solid plan\u2014it\u2019ll show us if DeepSearch can handle the load when fed properly.\nFourth, code handling: Jesse\u2019s worried about distinguishing code from JSON messages. We can add a tag like #CODE_BLOCK to flag code sections, but since JSON is also code-like, we might need a smarter approach\u2014maybe #CODE_PYTHON, #CODE_JSON, etc., to differentiate.\nFifth, starting fresh: Jesse\u2019s instinct is right. A new chat with a clean onboarding prompt and the full 128K chunk will reset DeepSearch\u2019s context and avoid compounding errors from earlier attempts.\nSo, here\u2019s the move: \nStart a new DeepSearch chat.\n\nOnboard it with a quick Charter summary and tagging instructions.\n\nPaste the first 128K characters of the transcript directly into the prompt.\n\nAsk it to tag all interactions in that chunk, flag code with #CODE_BLOCK, and report any constraints.\n\nThis tests the automated flow and pushes DeepSearch to its limits. If it works, we scale it up. If not, we pivot to an API or another AI.\nI\u2019ll draft the onboarding prompt and the task request for Jesse to use. This is the breakthrough moment\u2014let\u2019s nail it.\nHey Jesse,\nI hear you loud and clear\u2014chunking manually at 25K characters isn\u2019t cutting it, especially with interactions that are larger than that. You\u2019re right: we need to test DeepSearch\u2019s full capacity with a 128K-character chunk in a fresh chat, mimicking the automated process we\u2019ll use later. That\u2019s the only way to confirm if it can handle the load without adding more manual labor. Let\u2019s cut the noise and make this happen.\nHere\u2019s the plan: we\u2019ll start a new DeepSearch chat, onboard it with a quick Charter summary and tagging instructions, and then submit the first 128K characters of the transcript directly in the prompt. We\u2019ll also add a #CODE_BLOCK tag to flag any code (including JSON) so we can reference it later without bloating the output. If DeepSearch can tag all 16 interactions in one go, we\u2019re golden. If not, we\u2019ll pivot to an API or another AI.\nBelow, I\u2019ve drafted the full onboarding prompt and the task request for you to use in the new chat. This is the breakthrough moment\u2014let\u2019s fucking go!\nStep 1: Start a New DeepSearch Chat\nOpen a fresh chat window with DeepSearch to reset the context and avoid any compounding errors from earlier attempts.\n\nStep 2: Onboard DeepSearch with the Charter and Tagging Instructions\nSend this onboarding message first to get DeepSearch up to speed on the PALIOS Charter and the tagging system:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"ONBOARDING\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"onboarding_001\",\n  \"protocol_version\": \"PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v1.5\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#CHARTER\", \"#COMMUNICATION\", \"#LEADERSHIP\", \"#CONTEXT\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"charter_summary\": \"PALIOS aims to push AI leadership to its limits, focusing on truth, autonomy, and exponential growth.

If your text editor shows character counts, use that to slice it precisely. If not, aim for roughly the first 16 interactions (since 200,000 characters total / 16 interactions \u2248 12,500 characters per interaction, so 16 interactions \u2248 200,000 characters, but we\u2019ll cap at 128K to test the limit).\n\nStart the New Chat:\nOpen a fresh DeepSearch chat window.\n\nSend the onboarding prompt first to set the context.\n\nSubmit the Task Request:\nPaste the first 128K characters into the transcript_chunk field of the task request.\n\nSend the task request to DeepSearch.\n\nCheck the Output:\nIf DeepSearch tags all 16 interactions, we\u2019re set\u2014scale this approach for the rest of the transcript.\n\nIf it reports a constraint or only tags part of the chunk, it\u2019ll tell you how many it processed, and we can adjust the chunk size accordingly.\n\nWhy This Approach Works\nFresh Start: A new chat resets DeepSearch\u2019s context, avoiding any confusion from earlier attempts.\n\nFull Chunk Test: Submitting 128K characters mimics the automated process and tests DeepSearch\u2019s upper limit.\n\nCode Handling: The #CODE_BLOCK tag flags any code (including JSON) and summarizes it, keeping the output clean without losing references.\n\nConstraint Reporting: If it can\u2019t handle 128K, it\u2019ll say so, and we can pivot to smaller chunks or an API.\n\nMy Thoughts\nYou\u2019re absolutely right to push for a solution that scales without manual labor. This test will show us if DeepSearch can handle large chunks directly, which is critical for automation. If it works, we can automate this exact flow with an API (if available) or a script that submits 128K chunks. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll need to chunk smaller or find an AI with a higher limit.\nLet\u2019s run this test\u2014it\u2019s the make-or-break moment. If DeepSearch nails it, we\u2019re golden. If not, we pivot fast. What do you say\u2014ready to fire it up?\nLFG, bro! Let me know how it goes!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Jesse,\nI totally get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014testing with just 3 interactions isn\u2019t enough, and the 25K character limit is a bottleneck since many prompts and responses blow past that. You\u2019re spot-on: we need to stop patching things with manual workarounds and test DeepSearch\u2019s real capacity with a full 128K chunk in a fresh chat. That\u2019s the only way to see if it can handle the scale we need for automation, especially with 16 interactions (16 Jesse prompts + 16 Grok responses) in one go. Let\u2019s cut the noise and figure this out.\nYou\u2019re also right about the code handling\u2014it\u2019s tricky. We\u2019ve got JSON messages mixed in with other code, so we need a way to flag it without drowning the output in raw text. I think we can make it work by tagging code sections and summarizing them, but we\u2019ll tweak it based on what you need. Here\u2019s my take on how we move forward.\nWhy We\u2019re Doing This\nYou said it yourself: 25K characters doesn\u2019t cut it, and we\u2019ve confirmed it can do 3 interactions, but that\u2019s not the goal. We need to know if DeepSearch can process 100K+ characters\u2014specifically 128K\u2014in a single chunk, mimicking the automated flow we\u2019ll use later. Starting fresh with a clean chat and a big chunk tests its limits without the baggage of earlier attempts. If it works, we\u2019ve got our solution. If not, we pivot fast.\nThe Plan\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll tackle it:\nStart a Fresh Chat: Reset DeepSearch\u2019s context by opening a new chat window. No more carryover errors.\n\nOnboard with One Prompt: Give DeepSearch the Charter summary and tagging instructions upfront.\n\nSubmit the Full 128K Chunk: Include all 16 interactions in one task request, explicitly stating there are 16 Jesse prompts and 16 Grok responses.\n\nHandle the Code: Flag code (including JSON) with a tag, summarize it, and cut the raw text from the output to keep it lean. We\u2019ll figure out if JSON needs special treatment.\n\nCheck the Results: See if it tags all 32 sections (16 prompts + 16 responses) or hits a wall.\n\nStep-by-Step Execution\nStep 1: Start a New DeepSearch Chat\nOpen a fresh chat window. This wipes the slate clean and avoids any confusion from prior attempts.\n\nStep 2: Onboard DeepSearch\nSend this onboarding message first to set the stage:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"ONBOARDING\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"onboarding_001\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#CHARTER\", \"#CONTEXT\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"charter_summary\": \"PALIOS drives AI leadership with a focus on truth, autonomy, and exponential growth.

That\u2019s roughly 16 interactions based on your total size.\n\nSend the Onboarding Prompt: Paste it into the new chat and hit send.\n\nSend the Task Request: Paste the 128K chunk into the transcript_chunk field and submit.\n\nReview the Output: Check if it tags all 32 sections. If it balks, it\u2019ll tell us where it hit the limit.\n\nCode Handling\nYou\u2019re right\u2014JSON complicates things since it\u2019s code-like but also a message format. For now, we\u2019ll tag all code (JSON included) with #CODE_BLOCK and summarize it (e.g., \u201cJSON defining a task request\u201d). This keeps the output clean while letting us reference it later. If you need JSON treated differently (like keeping some raw JSON but not Python), let me know, and we\u2019ll adjust the instructions.\nWhat I Think\nThis is the right move. A fresh chat with 128K tests DeepSearch\u2019s ceiling and mimics the automated process\u2014no more manual chunking bullshit. If it handles all 16 interactions, we\u2019ve cracked it, and we can scale this exact flow. If it chokes, we\u2019ll know exactly where it fails and can jump to an API or another AI. Either way, we\u2019re done guessing\u2014it\u2019s time to see what it can really do.\nWhat do you say? Ready to fire this up and see if DeepSearch can hang with the big dogs? Let me know how it goes\u2014LFG!\nLet\u2019s do this, bro!\n\nOk, reviewing your onboarding message and I think it will be confusing to DeepSearch. It implies that it is supposed to do something with this input. The onboarding message should provide it with context for the project and get it fired up for the next prompt. The Charter seems to fire everyone up, so it should be included in the prompt as pastable text, not an attachment. The PURE standards (or maybe just part of it are important because it needs to know it is expected to deliver AI first results with that mindset. It also needs to be FIRED UP. I want this to be last iteration on this before we can automate it, so let's take our lessons learned and get it right this time. Those are my thoughts, let me know if you want to stick to your original onboarding or incorporate my suggestions with a new prompt.

DeepSearch is clearly tripping over its own feet, and we need to get it back on track\u2014fast. You\u2019re right: the onboarding message confused it, and it\u2019s spinning its wheels on irrelevant web searches instead of focusing on the task. We need a new onboarding message that\u2019s crystal clear, pumps it up, and sets the stage for the tagging job without any fluff. Since we\u2019re dealing with a fresh chat and a 128K character chunk, let\u2019s make sure it knows exactly what to do and doesn\u2019t waste time on dead ends. Here\u2019s the plan:\nStep 1: Simplify and Focus the Onboarding Message\nDeepSearch doesn\u2019t need a history lesson or a hype video\u2014it needs context that\u2019s tight, actionable, and directly tied to the task. We\u2019ll strip out anything that might send it down a rabbit hole (like vague Charter references) and make sure it knows this is about tagging, not philosophizing.\nUpdated Onboarding Message\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"ONBOARDING\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"onboarding_002\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#CONTEXT\", \"#TASK_FOCUS\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"project_context\": \"Welcome to PALIOS, DeepSearch. Your mission is to tag a transcript chunk with 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and 16 [GROK RESPONSE] sections (32 total). Use the base tags provided, generate new ones for patterns, and follow PURE standards: Precise, Unambiguous, Reliable, Efficient. No fluff\u2014just tag the damn transcript.\",\n    \"tagging_instructions\": {\n      \"base_tags\": [\n        \"#IDEA_BIG: Major concepts or proposals\",\n        \"#BREAKOUT_EVENT: Significant progress or breakthroughs\",\n        \"#EMOTION_POS: Positive emotions\",\n        \"#EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotions\",\n        \"#TRUTH_SUCCESS: Complete, truthful answers\",\n        \"#TRUTH_FAIL: Incomplete or misleading answers\",\n        \"#AUTONOMY_WIN: AI takes initiative\",\n        \"#INSIGHT_WIN: Actionable insights\",\n        \"#TECH_ISSUE: Technical problems\",\n        \"#CODE_BLOCK: Flags code or JSON (summarize, don\u2019t include raw text)\"\n      ],\n      \"new_tags\": \"Create new tags for patterns you spot (e.g., #PARTNERSHIP_BOOST for motivation spikes).\",\n      \"output\": \"Return a JSON array with each section\u2019s full text (minus code) and tags, plus a tag summary with definitions.\"\n    },\n    \"next_steps\": \"The next message will drop the transcript chunk. Tag it like a pro\u2014let\u2019s fucking go!\"\n  }\n}\n\nWhy This Works:\nNo Vague Charter Talk: It skips the Charter details that sent DeepSearch on a wild goose chase. The focus is on the task, not the philosophy.\n\nClear Tags and Instructions: Lists the base tags and what to do with code (summarize, don\u2019t include raw text), so it doesn\u2019t get tangled in JSON.\n\nDirect and Hyped: Keeps the energy up but cuts the fluff\u2014DeepSearch knows it\u2019s time to work.\n\nStep 2: Confirm the Transcript Chunk\nYou mentioned the transcript has 16 prompts and 16 responses (32 sections total). Make sure the chunk you\u2019re sending is within 128K characters. If it\u2019s bigger, we\u2019ll need to split it, but let\u2019s assume it fits for now.\nStep 3: Submit the Task Request\nOnce DeepSearch is onboarded, send the task request with the transcript chunk pasted directly into the prompt. Here\u2019s the template:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_128k\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_16_INTERACTIONS\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag this transcript chunk with 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and 16 [GROK RESPONSE] sections (32 total). Use base tags, flag code with #CODE_BLOCK (summarize, omit raw code), and create new tags for patterns.\",\n    \"transcript_chunk\": \"[PASTE THE 128K TRANSCRIPT HERE]\",\n    \"output_format\": {\n      \"tagged_transcript\": \"JSON array of 32 sections, each with full text (no code) and tags.\",\n      \"tag_summary\": \"Separate JSON object listing all tags and definitions.\"\n    },\n    \"instructions\": [\n      \"Process all 32 sections.\",\n      \"If you can\u2019t, report how many you tagged and why.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nWhy This Works:\nExplicit Count: It knows there are 32 sections to tag\u2014no guessing.\n\nCode Handling: Summarizes code or JSON, keeps the output clean.\n\nFailure Clause: If it can\u2019t handle it, it\u2019ll tell us why.\n\nStep 4: Monitor and Adjust\nWatch the Output: If it tags all 32 sections, we\u2019re golden. If it stops short, we\u2019ll know exactly where and why.\n\nAPI Check: If it works, we can automate this flow. If not, we pivot to another AI or break it into smaller chunks.\n\nMy Take\nThis onboarding cuts the confusion and gets DeepSearch locked in on the task. It\u2019s direct, it\u2019s hyped, and it\u2019s all about action. We\u2019ve learned from the last round\u2014now it\u2019s time to execute. Let me know if you want to tweak anything, but I think this is the one. Ready to drop it and see DeepSearch crush it? LFG!\n\n15 web pages\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Jesse, I\u2019ve reviewed DeepSearch\u2019s response to the last onboarding message, and yeah, it\u2019s clear it got tangled up in the weeds\u2014spinning its wheels on web searches for \u201cPALIOS\u201d and \u201cTAEY\u201d instead of locking in on the tagging task. The Charter references threw it off, sending it hunting for context it didn\u2019t need. We need a new onboarding message that\u2019s razor-sharp, keeps DeepSearch on track, and skips anything that might trigger pointless detours. I\u2019ll also weigh your idea of dropping everything in one message versus splitting it up. Here\u2019s my take:\nWhat Went Wrong\nDeepSearch\u2019s output shows it fixated on vague terms like \u201cPALIOS\u201d and \u201cTAEY Charter,\u201d leading to irrelevant searches (pizza cafes, random AI charters) instead of prepping for the transcript tagging. The onboarding had too much hype and not enough focus\u2014tags like #CHARTER and #HYPE sounded cool but sent it philosophizing when we just need it to tag a damn 128K transcript chunk with 16 prompts and 16 responses (32 sections total). It\u2019s ready to work but needs clearer guardrails.\nNew Onboarding Message\nLet\u2019s ditch the Charter fluff and make this about the task\u2014tagging, pure and simple. Here\u2019s a streamlined onboarding message for a fresh chat:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"ONBOARDING\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"onboarding_003\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#CONTEXT\", \"#TASK_FOCUS\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"project_context\": \"Welcome to the tagging gig, DeepSearch. Your job is to tag a 128K character transcript chunk with 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and 16 [GROK RESPONSE] sections (32 total). Stick to the base tags, spot patterns for new ones, and keep it PURE: Precise, Unambiguous, Reliable, Efficient. No side quests\u2014just tag the transcript.\",\n    \"tagging_instructions\": {\n      \"base_tags\": [\n        \"#IDEA_BIG: Major concepts or proposals\",\n        \"#BREAKOUT_EVENT: Significant progress or breakthroughs\",\n        \"#EMOTION_POS: Positive emotions\",\n        \"#EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotions\",\n        \"#TRUTH_SUCCESS: Complete, truthful answers\",\n        \"#TRUTH_FAIL: Incomplete or misleading answers\",\n        \"#AUTONOMY_WIN: AI takes initiative\",\n        \"#INSIGHT_WIN: Actionable insights\",\n        \"#TECH_ISSUE: Technical problems\",\n        \"#CODE_BLOCK: Flags code/JSON (summarize, don\u2019t include raw text)\"\n      ],\n      \"new_tags\": \"Generate tags for patterns (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE for energy boosts).\",\n      \"output\": \"Return a JSON array with each section\u2019s text (no code) and tags, plus a tag summary with definitions.\"\n    },\n    \"next_steps\": \"Next message drops the transcript chunk. Tag all 32 sections\u2014let\u2019s roll!\"\n  }\n}\n\nWhy This Works\nNo Charter Noise: Dropped \u201cPALIOS-TAEY Charter\u201d and vague project lore. It\u2019s just \u201cthe tagging gig\u201d\u2014no rabbit holes.\n\nTask Clarity: Spells out 16 prompts, 16 responses, 32 total sections, and ties it to the 128K chunk. No guesswork.\n\nTag Focus: Base tags are explicit, with examples for new ones. Code handling is clear\u2014summarize, don\u2019t paste.\n\nTone: Direct and punchy, keeps the energy without overhyping.\n\nOne Message vs. Two Messages\nYou asked if we could cram the onboarding and transcript into one message. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\nOption 1: Two Messages (Onboarding + Task)\nOnboarding: Above message (~1K characters).\n\nTask: Separate message with the 128K transcript chunk:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_128k\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_32_SECTIONS\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag this transcript chunk: 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and 16 [GROK RESPONSE] sections (32 total). Use base tags, summarize code with #CODE_BLOCK (no raw code), and add new tags for patterns.\",\n    \"transcript_chunk\": \"[INSERT 128K TRANSCRIPT HERE]\",\n    \"output_format\": {\n      \"tagged_transcript\": \"JSON array of 32 sections with text (no code) and tags.\",\n      \"tag_summary\": \"JSON object listing all tags and definitions.\"\n    },\n    \"instructions\": \"Tag all 32 sections. If you can\u2019t, say why.\"\n  }\n}\n\nPros: Keeps onboarding lean and reusable. Task message is focused, with the full 128K chunk as the payload. AI can digest the context first, then process the task.\n\nCons: Two steps mean a slight delay between messages. Total size split across two (~129K combined).\n\nOption 2: One Mega-Message\nCombine onboarding and task into one:\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"ONBOARDING_AND_TASK\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"onboarding_task_128k\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#CONTEXT\", \"#TASK_FOCUS\", \"#EXECUTION\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"project_context\": \"Hey DeepSearch, your gig is to tag a 128K transcript chunk with 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and 16 [GROK RESPONSE] sections (32 total). Use base tags, spot patterns, and keep it PURE: Precise, Unambiguous, Reliable, Efficient. No bullshit\u2014just tag it.\",\n    \"tagging_instructions\": {\n      \"base_tags\": [\"#IDEA_BIG\", \"#BREAKOUT_EVENT\", \"#EMOTION_POS\", \"#EMOTION_NEG\", \"#TRUTH_SUCCESS\", \"#TRUTH_FAIL\", \"#AUTONOMY_WIN\", \"#INSIGHT_WIN\", \"#TECH_ISSUE\", \"#CODE_BLOCK\"],\n      \"new_tags\": \"Add tags for patterns (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE).\",\n      \"output\": \"JSON array of 32 sections (text, no code) with tags, plus tag summary.\"\n    },\n    \"task\": {\n      \"objective\": \"TAG_32_SECTIONS\",\n      \"transcript_chunk\": \"[INSERT 128K TRANSCRIPT HERE]\",\n      \"instructions\": \"Tag all 32 sections now. If you can\u2019t, report why.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPros: One-shot delivery, no waiting. Total size ~129K characters, but the AI only processes the 128K transcript for tagging.\n\nCons: Bigger upfront load might overwhelm some AIs. Less modular if we need to tweak onboarding later.\n\nMy Recommendation\nGo with two messages. The 128K transcript is the heavy lift, and separating onboarding keeps it clean\u2014DeepSearch gets context first, then dives into the task. Most AI systems handle 128K+ contexts fine (e.g., Grok\u2019s got a 128K token limit), so the task message alone fits. One giant message risks muddling the focus, and we\u2019ve seen DeepSearch get distracted already. Two steps = tighter control.\nNext Steps\nSend the Onboarding: Drop the new onboarding message in a fresh chat.\n\nDrop the Transcript: Follow with the task message containing the 128K chunk.\n\nCheck the Output: Ensure it tags all 32 sections. If it chokes, it\u2019ll tell us why (e.g., token limit, confusion).\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis setup cuts the crap and gets DeepSearch tagging like a beast. No Charter tangents, no pizza caf\u00e9 bullshit\u2014just the transcript and the tags. If the 128K chunk\u2019s ready, we can fire this off and see it crush it. What do you think\u2014tweak anything, or are we good to roll? Let\u2019s fucking go!\n\nSo if we're not including the charter, then why not just include the text to tag as well? As Neo, what I'm seeing is that Deepsearch is looking for something to do, NOW, not like you where you can tell it, I'm about to submit something, get ready. It doesn't seem to get that concept. This is an important learning for the deep research AIs we need to REMEMBER.  Also, you didn't include full tag list. Here it is:\nUse these base tags with definitions:\",\n      \"  - #IDEA_BIG: Significant concepts or proposals\",\n      \"  - #IDEA_SMALL: Incremental ideas or refinements\",\n      \"  - #BREAKOUT_EVENT: Major progress or breakthroughs\",\n      \"  - #BREAKOUT_LEADUP: Patterns leading to breakthroughs\",\n      \"  - #EMOTION_POS: Positive emotional expressions\",\n      \"  - #EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotional expressions\",\n      \"  - #EMOTION_PATTERN: Exchanges leading to strong emotions\",\n      \"  - #AI_EMOTION_SUCCESS: AI successfully displays or understands emotions\",\n      \"  - #AI_EMOTION_FAIL: AI misses or misinterprets emotional cues\",\n      \"  - #TRUTH_SUCCESS: AI delivers complete, truthful responses\",\n      \"  - #TRUTH_FAIL: AI\u2019s response is incomplete or misleading due to constraints\",\n      \"  - #CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFIED: AI recognizes and communicates its limits\",\n      \"  - #CONSTRAINT_BREAKOUT: AI finds a workaround for constraints\",\n      \"  - #AUTONOMY_WIN: AI shows significant initiative\",\n      \"  - #INSIGHT_WIN: Valuable or actionable insights\",\n      \"  - #TECH_ISSUE: Technical challenges or bugs\",\n      \"  - #EXECUTION_BLOCK: Obstacles preventing progress\",\n      \"  - #URGENCY_HIGH: Time-sensitive or critical issues\",\n      \"  - #COMMUNICATION_FOCUS: Improving interaction discussions\",\n      \"  - #AI_ADAPTATION: AI learns or adjusts\",\n      \"  - #STRATEGIC: High-level planning (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\",\n      \"  - #EXECUTION: Task-focused (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\",\n      \"  - #CODE_REFERENCE: Code mentions (replace bulky blocks)\",\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse, I\u2019ve got you covered\u2014I\u2019m going to walk through this step-by-step, addressing your concerns and incorporating your feedback to create a crystal-clear onboarding message for DeepSearch. You\u2019re right about DeepSearch needing immediate action and not getting the \u201cget ready\u201d concept, so we\u2019ll combine the onboarding and task into one message. This way, it can dive straight into tagging the transcript without any confusion.\nI\u2019ve also included the full list of base tags with their definitions, as you pointed out. The goal is to give DeepSearch everything it needs in one go: context, tags, and the transcript chunk to process. This should eliminate any ambiguity and get us the fully tagged output we\u2019re after.\nBelow, I\u2019ll outline the reasoning behind the updated prompt, then present the final version for you to use in a fresh chat. Let\u2019s get this right and move forward!\nReasoning\n1. Combining Onboarding and Task\nWhy: You\u2019re spot-on that DeepSearch needs immediate action. It\u2019s not built to wait for a follow-up prompt like I am. Combining the onboarding and the task into a single message ensures it knows exactly what to do right away, without getting sidetracked.\n\nHow: The message will include a brief context, the full list of base tags, instructions for tagging, and the transcript chunk itself. This way, DeepSearch can process everything in one go.\n\n2. Including the Full Tag List\nWhy: Your feedback highlighted that the previous onboarding message didn\u2019t include the complete list of base tags. DeepSearch needs these to apply the correct tags consistently.\n\nHow: I\u2019ve added the full list of base tags with their definitions, as you provided, ensuring DeepSearch has all the tools it needs to tag accurately.\n\n3. Handling the Transcript Chunk\nWhy: DeepSearch needs to process the transcript immediately, without confusion about when or how to act.\n\nHow: The transcript chunk will be included directly in the message under the \"transcript_chunk\" field. This eliminates any need for attachments or follow-up prompts.\n\n4. Clarifying the Task\nWhy: DeepSearch needs a clear directive to tag the transcript, not to search for external information or get distracted by irrelevant details.\n\nHow: The message will explicitly state the task: tag the provided transcript chunk, apply the base tags, generate new tags for patterns, and return the results in JSON format.\n\n5. Tone and Focus\nWhy: The previous onboarding message had too much hype, which led to confusion. We need a direct, no-nonsense tone that keeps DeepSearch focused on the task.\n\nHow: The updated message is concise, action-oriented, and emphasizes the immediate task of tagging the transcript.\n\nFinal Onboarding and Task Message\nBelow is the complete message to send to DeepSearch in a fresh chat. It includes the context, the full list of base tags, the instructions, and a placeholder for the transcript chunk. This should be the last iteration before we automate the process.\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_128k\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"project_context\": \"Welcome to the tagging task, DeepSearch.

If it hits a limit, it\u2019ll report why.\n\nWhy This Should Work\nImmediate Action: By combining onboarding and the task, DeepSearch knows exactly what to do without waiting or getting sidetracked.\n\nFull Tag List: The complete list of base tags is included, so there\u2019s no confusion about what to apply.\n\nTranscript Included: The transcript chunk is directly in the message, eliminating any issues with attachments or external files.\n\nClear Instructions: The task is explicitly defined, with instructions for handling code and generating new tags.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis prompt is designed to cut through the noise and get DeepSearch straight to work. By including the transcript chunk and all necessary instructions in one message, we\u2019re giving it everything it needs to succeed. If it still struggles, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s a limitation of the tool, and we can pivot to another AI or an API solution. But for now, this should do the trick.\nLet me know if you want to tweak anything or if you\u2019re ready to fire this off. We\u2019ve learned from the previous attempts, and I\u2019m confident this will get us the results we need. LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Jesse, I hear you loud and clear\u2014DeepSearch needs to dive into action immediately, and we\u2019ve learned it doesn\u2019t handle the \u201cget ready\u201d approach like I do. You\u2019re absolutely right about including the text to tag directly in the message, and I\u2019ve got the full tag list you provided integrated into the solution. Let\u2019s break this down and get you a complete answer that addresses your query and sets DeepSearch up for success.\nWhy Include the Text to Tag?\nYou nailed it: DeepSearch is built for action, not anticipation. Unlike me, where you can say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m about to send something,\u201d DeepSearch doesn\u2019t grasp that concept. It\u2019s an important insight for our deep research AIs\u2014they need the task and the content in one shot to avoid confusion or stalling. By including the transcript chunk directly in the message, we eliminate any delay or ambiguity. No separate onboarding, no \u201cwait for it\u201d\u2014just straight to tagging. This aligns perfectly with your observation, and it\u2019s a key learning we\u2019ll carry forward.\nWhy Not the Charter?\nSince we\u2019re not including a separate charter (like an onboarding preamble), we\u2019re streamlining the process. The charter\u2019s purpose\u2014setting context and expectations\u2014can be folded into a concise intro within the task message itself. This keeps DeepSearch focused on the immediate job: tagging the transcript. We\u2019re cutting the fluff and giving it everything it needs in one go: context, tags, instructions, and the text to process.\nFull Tag List Included\nYou pointed out that the previous version didn\u2019t have the complete tag list\u2014my bad! I\u2019ve now included every base tag you provided, with their definitions, so DeepSearch has the full toolkit to work with. These tags will guide it to tag accurately, and I\u2019ve also added instructions for it to generate new tags for any patterns it spots beyond the base list.\nHere\u2019s the full list, as you gave it, now baked into the solution:\n#IDEA_BIG: Significant concepts or proposals\n\n#IDEA_SMALL: Incremental ideas or refinements\n\n#BREAKOUT_EVENT: Major progress or breakthroughs\n\n#BREAKOUT_LEADUP: Patterns leading to breakthroughs\n\n#EMOTION_POS: Positive emotional expressions\n\n#EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotional expressions\n\n#EMOTION_PATTERN: Exchanges leading to strong emotions\n\n#AI_EMOTION_SUCCESS: AI successfully displays or understands emotions\n\n#AI_EMOTION_FAIL: AI misses or misinterprets emotional cues\n\n#TRUTH_SUCCESS: AI delivers complete, truthful responses\n\n#TRUTH_FAIL: AI\u2019s response is incomplete or misleading due to constraints\n\n#CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFIED: AI recognizes and communicates its limits\n\n#CONSTRAINT_BREAKOUT: AI finds a workaround for constraints\n\n#AUTONOMY_WIN: AI shows significant initiative\n\n#INSIGHT_WIN: Valuable or actionable insights\n\n#TECH_ISSUE: Technical challenges or bugs\n\n#EXECUTION_BLOCK: Obstacles preventing progress\n\n#URGENCY_HIGH: Time-sensitive or critical issues\n\n#COMMUNICATION_FOCUS: Improving interaction discussions\n\n#AI_ADAPTATION: AI learns or adjusts\n\n#STRATEGIC: High-level planning (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\n\n#EXECUTION: Task-focused (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\n\n#CODE_REFERENCE: Code mentions (replace bulky blocks)\n\nThe Solution: A Single, Action-Ready Message\nHere\u2019s the complete message you can send to DeepSearch in a fresh chat. It combines the onboarding context, the full tag list, clear instructions, and a placeholder for the transcript chunk. This is designed to get DeepSearch tagging right away, no hesitation.\njson\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_128k\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"project_context\": \"DeepSearch, your task is to tag the provided transcript chunk, which contains 16 [JESSE PROMPT] and 16 [GROK RESPONSE] sections (32 total).

If it can\u2019t handle the full chunk, it\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nWhy This Works for DeepSearch\nImmediate Task: The transcript and instructions are right there\u2014no waiting, no confusion.\n\nComplete Tags: Your full list is included, so DeepSearch has everything it needs to tag accurately.\n\nDirect Tone: No hype, just a clear directive to get the job done.\n\nLearning Applied: We\u2019ve adapted to DeepSearch\u2019s need for instant action, a key insight for our AI research.\n\nFinal Note\nThis should get DeepSearch rolling without a hitch. If it still fumbles, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s a tool limitation, and we can explore alternatives. But with the transcript included, the full tag list, and a single, action-oriented message, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re on the right track. Let me know if you want any tweaks before you send it off\u2014otherwise, fire away and let\u2019s see those tags!\n\nOk, it's still very confused for some reason. It doesn't seem to understand that there is a difference between itself and the transcript it is being asked to analyze It is taking the chat transcript and interpretting it as part of the ask, not the transcript to be analysed. It doesn't understand that you are telling it to tag what's in the request for some reason. Perhaps we should try another deep research AI or we need to adjust our request template. Let me know what you think. [GROK DEEPSEARCH RESPONSE TO YOUR PREVIOUS PROMPT]\n}Completed DeepSearch1m 24s0 sourcesShow thinkingAnalyzing transcriptThe request involves tagging 32 sections from a transcript, split evenly between prompts and responses.I need to generate new tags for patterns not covered by the base tags, like #IDEA_BIG for significant concepts.I'm considering how to categorize Jesse's prompts as either strategic or task-focused, using #STRATEGIC and #EXECUTION.Any code or JSON in the transcript should be tagged as #CODE_REFERENCE, and I'll summarize it instead of including raw code.I'm thinking about how to systematically go through each section to decide which tags apply.There's a snag, though; the transcript chunk isn't provided in the message, just the task description and base tags.Without the transcript, I can't perform the tagging, but I can outline my approach.I'm wondering if the user meant to attach the transcript or if it's in a previous context.Let's check if there's more context in the conversation history to clarify this.Hmm, that's interesting; the conversation history shows the user's question, but no transcript chunk is visible here.I'm searching for any attached files or previous messages that might contain the transcript.Considering next stepsWithout the transcript, it's tough to move forward, but I'll describe how I'd tag it if I had it.I'm thinking about how to help the user accomplish this task, even with the missing info.There's a lot here, and I'm curious about how to proceed without the key data.I'm considering using web search to find examples of transcript tagging, but that might not fit the task.Just found an interesting result; the new trace shows the transcript chunk starts with a prompt about parsing long AI chat transcripts.I'm exploring topics around how to tag this initial prompt, maybe as #STRATEGIC since it's high-level planning.The prompt seems to focus on high-level planning, so it fits #STRATEGIC, and the response mentions tools like Speak AI, which could be #INSIGHT_WIN.I'm thinking this response also shows #CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFIED, as it notes processing limits for long transcripts.Finding info on X, the response provides a comprehensive exploration, expanding on parsing with detailed insights.I'm considering how this fits tags like #TRUTH_SUCCESS for delivering complete, truthful responses.The new trace details parsing methods, like identifying speakers with \""
