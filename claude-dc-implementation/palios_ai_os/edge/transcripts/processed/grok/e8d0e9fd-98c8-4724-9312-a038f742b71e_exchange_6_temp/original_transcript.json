    "I've received your query regarding the PALIOS-TAEY Framework cache files, and I'm ready to proceed with the review process as outlined. I understand that you\u2019ll be sharing the files in two submissions due to my constraints, and I\u2019ll hold my judgment until I\u2019ve reviewed all the documents in their entirety. My task is to thoroughly examine the first half of the files you\u2019ve provided, confirm that I\u2019ve done so, and then await the second submission before making a final decision."
