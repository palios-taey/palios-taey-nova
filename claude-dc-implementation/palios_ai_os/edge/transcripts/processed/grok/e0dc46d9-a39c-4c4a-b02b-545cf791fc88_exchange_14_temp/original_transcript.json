The optimal solution involves enhancing your existing Python script to automate the chunking and submission process, leveraging your Premium+ account's API access. This approach minimizes manual intervention while ensuring accurate and efficient processing.\nKey Solutions\nAutomated Chunking with Code Block Exclusion:\nYour script can preprocess the transcript to exclude code blocks (e.g., sections within triple backticks) using regular expressions. This reduces the effective size of each chunk by removing irrelevant content.\n\nThe remaining conversation text can then be split into chunks of approximately 100,000 characters (or ~25,000 tokens), ensuring splits occur at natural message boundaries (e.g., between \""
