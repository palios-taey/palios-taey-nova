    "User: Impact of Varied Character Counts\n\nGrok: Research suggests that varied file sizes, with character counts ranging from dense to extensive, are manageable through segmentation and summarization. I can absorb context by breaking documents into parts, ensuring depth over speed, which aligns with your priority. For example, I can extract key points like autonomy levels (e.g., SOUL: 3/10, MIND: 7/10) without being overwhelmed, supporting your 600 hours of work."
