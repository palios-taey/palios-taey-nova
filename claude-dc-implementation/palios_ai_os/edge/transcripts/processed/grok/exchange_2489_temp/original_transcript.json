LFG!\n\nGrok: Yes, I'd like for you to incorporate your recommended changes into the PURE document, generating a full new output (if you can do so) or let me know final list of text to be updated, added and in what sections. This will be v1.5. Then we can use it for our next outsourcing task, which we'll get to when this is done."
