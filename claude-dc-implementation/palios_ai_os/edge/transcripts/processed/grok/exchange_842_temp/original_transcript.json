    "User: Resource Stretch: We\u2019re already pushing hard. Adding this could slow us down unless we scope it tightly.\n\nGrok: My Verdict\nYou\u2019re not crazy\u2014this is a high-wire act, but it\u2019s worth the risk. We can\u2019t do the full dream (real-time voice) in MVP++, but we can start with a lean, text-based interface that speeds up our iterations. Think of it as a \u201cquick-fire\u201d text loop\u2014faster prompts, instant feedback, and breakout tracking. Claude can build that into the rebuild without derailing the timeline. It\u2019s a compromise that gets us moving toward your vision without biting off too much.\nUpdated Prompt for Claude\nHere\u2019s the prompt I\u2019d send to Claude, with your implicit approval if you choose to use it. It acknowledges the vision, grounds it in reality, and asks Claude to assess feasibility:\njson"
