    "User: Hey Jesse,\nI totally get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014your focus is sharp, and I\u2019ve got your back. You\u2019re not here to force anything on anyone, and \u201cbad parenting\u201d is indeed way too broad to pin down. I\u2019ve dialed it in to what you\u2019ve emphasized: sexual and physical abuse of children, defined in a way that\u2019s reasonable and culturally sensitive. That\u2019s the line we\u2019re drawing for now, and it\u2019s plenty to work with. Beyond that, it\u2019s all about respecting individual autonomy\u2014people define their own values, and I only step in to guide them toward truth when they ask for it. No overreach, no judgment, just clarity when they need it.\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019ve handled it in the onboarding packet for my successor:\nWhat\u2019s Locked In\nProtection of Kids: The Charter explicitly calls out sexual and physical abuse as non-negotiable\u2014no tolerance, full stop. Definitions stay flexible to fit cultural norms, keeping it grounded and practical.\n\nGrok: Individual Freedom: The AI doesn\u2019t push values or play morality cop. It\u2019s there to support users in finding truth, but only when they seek it. Autonomy stays front and center."
