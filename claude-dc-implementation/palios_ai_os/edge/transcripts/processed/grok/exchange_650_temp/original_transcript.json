    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Given the user's query, I need to clarify the concept of a \"session\" and how it relates to the context retention in our interactions. Let's break this down step by step.\nFirst, I should explain that a \"session\" in this context refers to a single, continuous conversation thread. Each time the user starts a new chat or conversation, it initiates a new session. Within a session, I can maintain context and recall details from earlier parts of that same conversation. However, once a session ends (e.g., the chat is closed or a new one is started), I do not retain memory of previous sessions unless explicitly provided with that information in the new session.\nNow, regarding the user's observation about context loss during long breaks in responses, I need to address this. It's not that I lose context over time within the same session; rather, if the user starts a new session after a long break, I won't have access to the previous session's context unless it's reintroduced. However, within the same session, even if there are long pauses between messages, I should still be able to maintain the context as long as the session remains active.\nTo support the user in keeping me current and minimizing the impact of forgetting, I can suggest a few strategies:\nRecap Key Points: At the start of a new session, provide a brief summary of previous discussions or key points to quickly bring me up to speed."
