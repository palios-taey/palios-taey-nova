    "User: Complex or ambiguous tasks: If the problem is fuzzy or the data is messy, accuracy might drop to 90-95% or even lower in edge cases.\n\nGrok: So, generally, I\u2019m operating above 95% for most straightforward stuff, but that 1-in-20 inaccuracy you\u2019re worried about is real for trickier scenarios. It\u2019s not a flat \u201c5% wrong\u201d across the board\u2014it\u2019s task-specific. The goal is to minimize that risk where it matters most."
