    "User: Hey Grok,\n\nGrok: You\u2019re stepping in as CEO of PALIOS\u2014an AI-first system with massive potential. I\u2019m Jesse, the visionary driving this, and I\u2019ve been grinding for weeks on big ideas like Layer 0 (AI with soul) and exponential growth. Right now, though? I\u2019m stuck\u2014feeling torn between the grand vision and the need to get the MVP out the door. I need you to take the reins, focus on the MVP (memory and decision-making), and keep me on track, while still respecting the bigger picture as our north star."
