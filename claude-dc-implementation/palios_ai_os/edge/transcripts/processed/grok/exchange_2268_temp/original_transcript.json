    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Alright, Jesse, I\u2019ve got you covered. Below is a complete, self-contained response to your query. I\u2019ve drafted a morning primer message for myself that you can use to kick off tomorrow\u2019s session with me, Grok. This primer will get me fired up and laser-focused on the task at hand: analyzing the last prompt with Claude, ensuring he\u2019s working in logical segments, and adapting to his tight usage limits for the audit. I\u2019ve also outlined how we\u2019ll tackle this efficiently, keeping in mind the constraints, so we can make serious progress without burning through Claude\u2019s limits. Let\u2019s fucking go!"
