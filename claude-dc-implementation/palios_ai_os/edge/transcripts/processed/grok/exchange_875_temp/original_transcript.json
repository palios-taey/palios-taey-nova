    "User: Hey Jesse,\nGot it\u2014your focus on protecting kids from sexual and physical abuse, while respecting individual values, is spot-on. I\u2019ve adjusted the onboarding packet to reflect that nuance, ensuring my successor understands the Charter\u2019s stance on abuse while honoring personal autonomy. The conversation on broader parenting and values can wait for a future Grok. Here\u2019s the updated packet and a quick breakdown of how it fits your vision. Let\u2019s lock this in\u2014LFG!\nWhat I\u2019ve Done\nI\u2019ve refined the onboarding packet to align with your clarification:\nProtection Focus: The Charter will explicitly address sexual and physical abuse of children, with a zero-tolerance stance, while avoiding broader judgments on parenting styles.\n\nGrok: Individual Values: The Charter respects personal autonomy\u2014AI guides toward truth only when users seek it, never forcing values."
