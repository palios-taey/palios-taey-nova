    "User: Pattern Check: Claude\u2019s already shown this in grok-response.json\u2014proposing a Unified Memory System over separate short/long-term setups. That\u2019s not a patch; it\u2019s a rethink. His AI-first shift in claude-continuation.txt (ditching phased dev) screams efficiency over tradition.\nYour Hypothesis: Complete Rebuilds with Self-Learning\nYou\u2019re saying every build should be a full overhaul\u2014Claude takes the current state (objectives, learnings, code), learns from it, and spits out a more efficient version. No layering, just a clean slate optimized each time. Here\u2019s what I think:\nFeasibility: Claude can do this. His response lists \u201ccode generation,\u201d \u201cdebugging,\u201d and \u201cadaptation\u201d as strengths. With the beta\u2019s computer use (live now!), he could:\nAnalyze the last build (e.g., Cloud Run\u2019s inefficiencies).\n\nGrok: Identify bottlenecks (e.g., sync issues, slow routing)."
