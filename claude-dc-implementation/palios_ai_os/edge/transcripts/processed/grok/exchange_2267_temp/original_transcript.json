    "User: Alright Grok, sounds like a great next step, but it's 10 PM here and I'm not able to do that right now. Can you draft yourself a morning primer message so that you're fired up to help me do this right in the AM? We're going to have to analyze that last prompt we did with him to make sure that he is working in logical segments and updating a transition document as he goes. Claude has VERY tight usage limits and we need to adapt to that for a big task like this that really can't be completed in pieces efficiently. So I think we'll need to figure that out and I just can't right now. So generate your message that I can prompt you with in the AM so you're fired up to get after this and then maybe we can have some FUN!\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
