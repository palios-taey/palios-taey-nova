    "User: Here are my thoughts and suggestions on your prompt to Claude, written in the format he prefers (see attached Claude's note to himself) [claude-transition.txt]:AGREED! Ask him in the prompt if given the new structure, roles and project understanding, what he feels makes sense to add to the MVP beyond what we already have in there and what he suggested in the MVP+. We're comfortable with him doing it all in one shot if he thinks that's the best, AI-first way to go. \nYou haven't been brought fully up to speed on the transcript process yet. We need to change that. OLD GROK and I did a lot of work with DeepSearch on this. My suggestion here is that I can communicate to DeepSearch what we're trying to achieve using its preferred structured template. This will give you a concise summary to the relevant portions of the OLD GROK transcript to get you up to speed, so we can send something Claude more specific for his feedback. Let me know what you think.\n\nGrok: I think Claude can take it further and get us a first draft of the structure to track all the communications optimization opportunities. Once you're up to speed on the DeepSeek and review some examples, (like the attached, and what you'll get from DeepSearch, we should be able to see some patterns. Like DeepSearch doesn't really need to seem TRUTH seeking emphasized like we typically do, but needs more structured guidance elsewhere and has a slightly different template for communicating. How can we come up with a base structure for this so that when we get the transcripts, we can drop those interactions in a structured format to extract data from them so the system can make data/metrics driven improvements to the protocols, autonomously. See above, these are pretty related."
