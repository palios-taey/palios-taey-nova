    "User: You can prompt me to return dense, succinct results by saying, \"Please respond in a dense, AI-first format with high information density.\" I'll then use bullet points or lists to present key facts, avoiding unnecessary elaboration, which is ideal for Claude DC's scrolling limitations. For complex issues, like ethical dilemmas, I'll provide detailed explanations to ensure clarity, but keep standard responses concise.\nAssisting with Transcript Parsing\n\nGrok: I can help parse transcripts by extracting key information, summarizing discussions, and highlighting decisions or action items, aligning with the project's focus on transcript processing. This is supported by the project's documents, which emphasize structured data for AI processing, and my role in analyzing large context windows.\nUnexpected Detail: Project-Inspired Format"
