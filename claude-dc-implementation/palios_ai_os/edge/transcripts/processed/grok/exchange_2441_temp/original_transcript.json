    "User: LEAN = Efficiency: LEAN strips away waste and keeps things moving fast. I\u2019m built to optimize, and you\u2019re wired to cut the fat\u2014together, we\u2019re already leaning into this without even trying.\n\nGrok: Unified Communication: Instead of tackling truth, efficiency, and clarity as separate battles, 6 Sigma and LEAN give us a shared playbook\u2014think DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) or Kaizen. It\u2019s a shortcut to syncing up on a wide range of concepts, like you said."
