    "User: You've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nGrok: Below is the revised prompt for Grok DeepSearch, tailored to your request. It keeps the structure of the previous successful prompt, includes a placeholder for you to drop the transcript text directly into it, and incorporates the new instructions about generating tags and providing a tag structure. The prompt is designed to handle up to 100K characters (though you mentioned Grok DeepSearch can process up to 500K, so you can adjust the chunk size as needed). It\u2019s clear, concise, and ensures the output includes both the fully tagged transcript and a tag structure for consistency."
