    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Alright, Jesse wants to keep the chunk sizes as they are, which is fine if DeepSearch handled them without issues. Now, the focus is on managing the tags, especially the new ones generated by DeepSearch, and ensuring consistency across iterations. He\u2019s thinking ahead to when this process is automated via API, and he wants a structured way to handle new tags so they can be imported into a \u201cmaster tag database table.\u201d This makes sense for maintaining consistency and tracking tag usage over time."
