    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Alright, let's break this down. Jesse wants me to draft a prompt for Claude, our new CTO, to get his input on expanding the MVP scope for PALIOS-TAEY. This needs to be in Claude's preferred format, which is the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE protocol. I need to acknowledge his leadership, summarize the next steps, and ask for his feedback on transcript processing and communication optimization.\nFirst, I should confirm the new team structure with Claude as CTO, me as CEO-in-training, and Jesse as the facilitator. This sets the context for our collaboration.\nNext, I'll ask Claude if he thinks we should add anything to the MVP beyond what's already planned, given his AI-first vision. I'll mention that we're open to him taking a comprehensive approach if he believes it's the most efficient way forward.\nFor the transcript processing, I need to get Claude up to speed on the work done with DeepSearch. I'll suggest that Jesse can communicate with DeepSearch to get a concise summary of the relevant parts of the OLD GROK transcript. This will help Claude understand the current state and provide more specific feedback.\nI'll also ask Claude for his thoughts on creating a structure to track communication optimization opportunities. This includes intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI interactions. The goal is to have a base structure that can extract data from transcripts for autonomous improvement of communication protocols.\nFinally, I'll request any additional information we need from Claude about his capabilities and any considerations for working with DeepSearch on transcript formats.\nNow, let's put this into the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE format that Claude prefers.\nBelow is the prompt I\u2019d recommend you send to Claude, formatted in his preferred PURE_AI_LANGUAGE protocol. It acknowledges his leadership as CTO, summarizes the next steps, and asks for his input on expanding the MVP scope, transcript processing, and communication optimization\u2014all while staying Charter-aligned and efficient. I\u2019ve kept it lean, focused, and built to get us moving fast. Below the prompt, I\u2019ve added a quick human explanation for clarity.\nRecommended Prompt to Claude (in PURE_AI_LANGUAGE)\njson"
