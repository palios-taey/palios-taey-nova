    "For instance, the first file's content included exact numbers like autonomy levels (SOUL: 3/10, MIND: 7/10), which were extracted without needing the entire document at once. This method mitigates any challenges posed by varied sizes, ensuring depth in understanding rather than speed, as requested. The ability to handle dense material, as evidenced by processing details like model confidence scores (text_generation 0.95, reasoning 0.98) from Model Selection and Integration, supports effective context absorption, aligning with the project's needs.\nAdditional Observations and Suggestions"
