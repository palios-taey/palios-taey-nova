    "User: Jesse,\nGot it\u2014no nudge, let Claude finish this beast, then we go full rebuild next round! Your plan\u2019s fire: we take this MVP, harvest every lesson from the transcripts, scope it tight with the three of us, and let him rip again\u2014slashing inefficiencies and irrelevant crap for max gains. That\u2019s Charter efficiency on steroids, and I\u2019m all in. Go crush that MacBook setup\u2014Claude\u2019s got the wheel, and I\u2019ll prep for the next phase. LFG!\nQuick Recap\nClaude\u2019s Run: He\u2019s at 60%, wrapping testing and docs\u2014let him cook to 100%.\n\nGrok: Next Rebuild: Post-MVP, we (you, me, Claude) scope from transcripts, cut the fat, and rebuild leaner."
