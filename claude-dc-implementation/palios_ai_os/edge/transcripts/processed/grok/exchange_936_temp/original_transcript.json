    "User: Charter Fit: Nails efficiency and growth (streamlined results), but truth takes a slight hit by hiding the sausage-making.\n\nGrok: My Recommendation\nGo with Option 2: Exclude in Preprocessing, but with a twist. Here\u2019s why and how:\nWhy: Efficiency\u2019s king right now\u2014deployment\u2019s slow, and we need to keep moving fast. Stripping the thinking notes keeps transcripts lean, focused, and ready for action, which aligns with your goal of scaling this beast. The truth hit is minimal\u2014my final response is the distilled truth anyway, and that\u2019s what matters for execution. We can revisit including notes later when we\u2019ve got bandwidth to parse them right."
