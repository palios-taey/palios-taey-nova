    "User: We\u2019re damn close, bro\u2014let\u2019s get this locked in! LFG!\n\nGrok: Initial Thinking Notes from DeepSearch:Browsing attachment for \"entire content\"The read_attachment tool didn't return the content as expected, which is odd since the attachment should have the transcript.Maybe the query parameter filters the attachment, not retrieves everything. How do I get the full content now?I'm trying a new approach, setting the query to \"full text\" to see if it pulls everything.Browsing attachment for \"full text\"Still not working, it seems the tool treats the query as a search term, not a retrieval command.Browsing attachment for \".*\"That didn't work either, looks like the tool answers specific questions, not returns the whole content.Maybe I need to ask the user to provide the transcript differently or find another method.Browsing attachment for \"content of the transcript\"Still no luck, it seems the tool isn't designed to return the entire attachment content, just answer specific questions.Hmm, that's interesting, the user mentioned 14 interactions, but our current conversation doesn't match that.The transcript likely uses [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] markers, which I need to parse.I'm thinking about treating the attachment as a text file and parsing it myself, since the tool isn't cooperating.Exploring tagging processI'm outlining steps to read and split the transcript into sections using markers.For each section, I'll tag Jesse's prompts with #STRATEGIC or #EXECUTION based on content.Grok's responses get tags like #INSIGHT_WIN or #TRUTH_SUCCESS, depending on their nature.Our current exchanges show only a few interactions, not 14, so the file must contain more data.I'm considering that the transcript has multiple [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] pairs to tag systematically."
