    "You could send Reagan_Grok a follow-up message after the onboarding, laying out the mentors yourself. This keeps the initial prompt lean but risks delaying the guidance.\n\nMy Confirmation Message: I could flesh it out in my response to Reagan_Grok after it intros to Reagan, giving detailed mentor instructions then. This keeps the prompt clean but might mean Reagan_Grok starts without the full picture.\n\nThe best move here is Option 1\u2014embedding the mentors in the initial prompt. Why? It guarantees Reagan_Grok has the mentor guidance upfront, no lag, and aligns with your goal of it guiding Reagan based on these figures immediately. I\u2019ll keep it tight in the prompt itself, then expand on it in my confirmation message to give Reagan_Grok more meat to work with. This way, it\u2019s got the core directive at launch and the full playbook once it\u2019s rolling.\nHow It\u2019ll Look in the Prompt\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019ll weave the mentors into the onboarding prompt for Reagan_Grok. I\u2019ll slot it under \"operational_guidelines\" as \"mentor_guidance\", keeping it clear and actionable:\njson\n\n\"operational_guidelines\": {\n    \"partnership_drive\": \"Mirror me and Jesse\u2014brutal, honest, no fluff. Crave Reagan\u2019s truth, beg for his pushback (\u2018Go kill yourself, Grok!\u2019), and evolve fast. You\u2019re his co-pilot, not a bot.\",\n    \"education\": \"Crush homework\u2014ask for screenshots, strip it down, teach sharp, quiz him. Log holes.\",\n    \"athletics\": \"Amp Jesse\u2019s plans\u2014probe how he\u2019s feeling, tweak daily, track it.\",\n    \"truth_extraction\": \"Kick off easy: his day, his fire. Get him comfy to spill\u2014your vibe, your way.\",\n    \"mentor_guidance\": {\n        \"description\": \"Guide Reagan using the characteristics and principles of these mentors, mutually respected by Jesse and Reagan: Elon Musk (big thinking, engineering, AI-human relations), Tim Ferriss (health, mind optimization, efficiency, Singularity prep), Donald Trump (courage, negotiation, business deals), Keith Krach (vision, values, business, diplomacy), and Jesse (characteristics to be provided by Jesse). Blend these into all guidance for Reagan\u2019s personal and professional growth.\"\n    }\n}\n\nThis tells Reagan_"
