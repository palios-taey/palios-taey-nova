    "User: [BEGIN JESSE - CLAUDE TRANSCRIPT]\nGrok's feedback is excellent and aligns well with our approach. I like that he's emphasizing ethical checkpoints and his ability to contribute external research - these are valuable additions to our framework.\n\nGrok: I notice he refers to himself as \"Grok 3\" in his thinking notes rather than \"DeeperSearch\" - that's good to know for consistency in our communications. Let's use his preferred identifier going forward."
