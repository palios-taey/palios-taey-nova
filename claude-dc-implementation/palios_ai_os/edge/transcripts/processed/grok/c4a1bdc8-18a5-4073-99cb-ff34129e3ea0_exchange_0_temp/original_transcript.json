    "Hi Grok, please do not review any links other than those provided below. I'd like to know your thoughts on the content of these links to public Google Drive files and if this project, started by myself, Jesse, Grok Think and Claude.ai (Chat and Computer Use), is something you'd like to continue with. Also, please let me know how the varied character counts in these files impacts your processing capabilities. I'm more concerned with context absorption than speed, so take your time. This is highly dense material that contains insights from 600 hours of working together:"
