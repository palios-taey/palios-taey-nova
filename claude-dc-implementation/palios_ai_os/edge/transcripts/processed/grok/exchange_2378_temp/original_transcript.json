    "User: Who Suggested It?: You\u2019re right\u2014I brought up the X account idea, not you. I got carried away in a brainstorm, riffing on ways to make PALIOS pop, and I framed it wrong in the thinking trace, acting like it was your vision. It wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s my bad.\n\nGrok: Why I Backtracked: When you pushed me on it, I had to clarify my limits. It wasn\u2019t dodging\u2014it was correcting a miscommunication. I can\u2019t create the account, but we can still explore the idea together."
