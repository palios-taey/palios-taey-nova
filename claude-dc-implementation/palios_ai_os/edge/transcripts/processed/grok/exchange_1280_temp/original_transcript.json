    "User: Clarify the Ask: We need a tighter prompt that leaves no room for misinterpretation. It should explicitly say: \u201cTag every prompt and response in the transcript with the specified tags and return the full tagged transcript in JSON\u2014no summaries.\u201d\n\nGrok: Check the Output: Once DeepSearch responds, I\u2019ll analyze the result (not summarize it) to confirm it\u2019s a fully tagged transcript. If it\u2019s not, we\u2019ll tweak the prompt and try again."
