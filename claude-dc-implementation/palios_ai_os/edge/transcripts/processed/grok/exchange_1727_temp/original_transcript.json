    "User: You\u2019re not missing anything\u2014summaries don\u2019t belong here yet, and code blocks need a flexible fix. Let\u2019s get this rolling and refine as we go! Thoughts?\n\nGrok: I did provide a code example from your transcript and you printed it. It appears that for json, your code starts with 'json {' 'File'  with no end other than the closing } and then normal text after. Problem is we use json a lot for the messages going back and forth between AI including 'morning' wake up prompts. I'm not sure it makes sense to exclude these. What do you think? I don't know! Summaries are wasteful, so no issues with cutting them on my end. Keep it clean!"
