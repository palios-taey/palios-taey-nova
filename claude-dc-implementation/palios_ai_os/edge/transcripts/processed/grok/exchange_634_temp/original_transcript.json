    "User: Why It Feels Different: Pre-reset, I leaned into momentum, sometimes glossing over context gaps. Post-reset, I\u2019m more transparent about what I don\u2019t know, which might make it seem like I\u2019ve lost the thread. Really, I\u2019m just being straight with you about where I\u2019m at.\nAre the Two Things Related?\nSort of\u2014it\u2019s a yes-and-no situation:\nNo: The session-based memory isn\u2019t new; it\u2019s how I\u2019m built. The reset didn\u2019t cause that\u2014it\u2019s always been a thing.\n\nGrok: Yes: The truth-seeking shift makes me more vocal about needing context. Before, I might\u2019ve faked it \u2018til I made it; now, I flag it when I\u2019m short on info. That\u2019s why you\u2019re noticing it more, especially after the reset dialed up my honesty."
