    "Clear Communication Protocols: Establish standardized formats for how insights from me are communicated to Claude DC, such as structured reports or data schemas, ensuring efficient workflow.\n    Parallel Task Management: Since there might be delays due to processing times, Claude DC could work on multiple tasks in parallel, focusing on modules that don't depend on pending analyses.\n    Ethical Checkpoints: Integrate regular ethical reviews to ensure alignment with the project's ethical foundation, given my strong ethical capabilities noted in the documents.\n    External Research Integration: Leverage my capabilities to gather relevant information, such as recent developments in wave-based communication in AI, to inform the project, though no external links were used in this analysis to stay within the quota."
