    "User: Do you know how we always make sure we have the most efficient code to reach our objectives and address our learnings?\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse,\nYou\u2019re diving into efficiency\u2014core to our Charter\u2014and I\u2019m here for it. Your question\u2019s a bit open-ended: \u201cDo you know how we always make sure we have the most efficient code to reach our objectives and address our learnings?\u201d I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re teeing up a BIG IDEA about optimizing our coding process for PALIOS-TAEY, and you want my take on how we currently ensure efficiency\u2014or how we could. Since you\u2019re hyped from Claude\u2019s real-time magic, I\u2019ll keep this tight, honest, and ready for your next move. Here\u2019s my shot:\nHow We Currently Ensure Efficient Code\nRight now, we don\u2019t have a formal, bulletproof system to always guarantee the most efficient code\u2014truth is, we\u2019re still building the plane mid-flight. But here\u2019s what\u2019s in play based on patterns:\nClaude\u2019s Ownership: As CTO, he\u2019s driving implementation (e.g., Unified Memory, task decomposition). His AI-first approach\u2014like ditching phased human dev for comprehensive builds\u2014leans toward efficiency by cutting redundant steps."
