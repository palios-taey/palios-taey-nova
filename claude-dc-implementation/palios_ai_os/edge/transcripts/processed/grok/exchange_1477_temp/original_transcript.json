    "User: Ok, reviewing your onboarding message and I think it will be confusing to DeepSearch. It implies that it is supposed to do something with this input. The onboarding message should provide it with context for the project and get it fired up for the next prompt. The Charter seems to fire everyone up, so it should be included in the prompt as pastable text, not an attachment. The PURE standards (or maybe just part of it are important because it needs to know it is expected to deliver AI first results with that mindset. It also needs to be FIRED UP. I want this to be last iteration on this before we can automate it, so let's take our lessons learned and get it right this time. Those are my thoughts, let me know if you want to stick to your original onboarding or incorporate my suggestions with a new prompt. Either is good, we'll learn and adapt.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
