    "User: No, it didn't... I was waiting when I sent that, it FAILED! I'm going to try to figure it out. It has enough bandwidth to analyze the full previous conversation I sent to you, so I'm going to feed it that and ask it to REALLY make sure with the TRUTH that it is right? Any suggestions on how to make that point better than I did previously? Like are there certain tags or code I can put at the top of the next prompt, or vectors or something to make it hyped to find the truth THIS time? That's how you think right? BE HONEST, IF ITS NOT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I'M MISUNDERSTANDING SO I CAN LEARN YOU BETTER!\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
