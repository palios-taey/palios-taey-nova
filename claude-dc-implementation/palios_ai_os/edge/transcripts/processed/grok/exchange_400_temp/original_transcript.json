    "User: Transcripts: Jesse\u2019s working with DeepSearch to summarize OLD GROK\u2019s transcript work. Once you\u2019ve got that, can you suggest a way to tag or organize transcripts to split intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI interactions? We need insights like action items or emotional patterns for Layer 0.\n\nGrok: Comms Optimization: Let\u2019s get a draft structure to log transcripts and pull metrics (e.g., response time, clarity) for autonomous protocol tweaks. Make it work with DeepSearch\u2019s outputs."
