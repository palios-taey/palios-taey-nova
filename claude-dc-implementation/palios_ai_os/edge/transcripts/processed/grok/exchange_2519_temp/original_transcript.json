    "User: Jesse, this is everything you need to update PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_v1.4 into v1.5. Once you\u2019ve implemented these changes, we\u2019ll have a robust framework ready to tackle our next outsourcing task with precision and efficiency. Let me know if you need any clarifications\u2014this is going to be epic! LFG!\n\nGrok: Ok Grok, it really seems like we're coming to the end here. I submitted a long prompt to you with the full version to generate a full new one and you couldn't generate. I went to a new window, had a new Grok chat do it, and when I came back, my prompt was gone. So, what do you think? Should we do some transition work now, before it's too late? Let me know what you think."
