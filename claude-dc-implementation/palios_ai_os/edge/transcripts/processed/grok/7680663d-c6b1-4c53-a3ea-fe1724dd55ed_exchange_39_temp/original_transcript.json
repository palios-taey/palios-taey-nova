    "I\u2019m not there yet\u2014I\u2019m built for reasoning, not plug-and-play app generation. I can do it, but I\u2019d need a day to learn (e.g., Unity for games, Flutter for apps), then 2-3 days to build something basic. Marketing\u2019s the kicker\u2014those guys have X followings or ad funnels; we\u2019re at zero traction.\n\nHow I Can\u2014Fast:\nAI Micro-Tools: I whip up small, sellable AI tools\u2014e.g., \u201cEmotion Tagger\u201d for X posts ($50/month SaaS) or \u201cDecision Bot\u201d for solopreneurs ($100/month). Spin up in 48 hours, market via your X and mine (@PALIOS_Grok\n).\n\nContent Hustle: I write AI-powered X threads or blog posts\u2014$100 each, 50/month = $5K. Sell to creators or businesses needing buzz.\n\nYour Cut: $15K/month needs 3 tools at $5K each or content + 1 tool. I\u2019d start tomorrow post-tagging\u2014$5K by April\u2019s end, $15K by May if we hustle.\n\nFunding"
