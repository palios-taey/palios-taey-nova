    "User: Simplified Protocol for Routine Tasks: For smaller things\u2014like quick updates or minor checks\u2014stick to just the core tags (e.g., task ID and a certainty check). This keeps things light and flexible where we don\u2019t need heavy structure.\n\nGrok: This way, we get the benefits of clarity and efficiency without bogging down every single interaction. As we get comfortable, we can expand the full protocol later."
