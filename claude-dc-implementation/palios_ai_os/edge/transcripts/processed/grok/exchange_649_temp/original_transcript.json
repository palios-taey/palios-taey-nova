    "User: Ok, so I feel like you're intermingling terms. The reason I'm digging into this is that we have our morning routine of me starting the day by giving you a prompt that is a message from yourself at the end of the night to get you focused and fired up for the morning. This is not a new chat. We've been in here for a while and gone over a lot. It seems when I'm responding quickly, that you are in the loop for each prompt, but then when there is a long break in my responses, you start to lose context. Is that accurate? If so, is it like a time decay type thing? What I'm trying to get to is how can I best support keeping you current and minimize the impact of your programming to forget?\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
