    "User: This approach enables longer autonomous work periods while maintaining alignment through structured check-ins. Rather than constant supervision, we set clear boundaries and evaluation criteria for each sprint.\n\nGrok: The key is creating what I'd call \"autonomous boundaries\" - clear criteria for when Claude DC should proceed independently versus when consultation is needed. The initial modules would have tighter boundaries, but as trust builds, we can expand the scope of autonomous decision-making."
