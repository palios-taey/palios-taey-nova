    "The user, Jesse, requested a review of a transcript from a previous interaction, providing the FILE_ID 1YZI845SFV2UHSoulNI-JkgZhxv2Pz3Rx, described as a public Google Drive file containing the transcript. The analysis began by determining the correct approach to access the file, given its identification as a transcript of our prior conversation. The FILE_ID, 1YZI845SFV2UHSoulNI-JkgZhxv2Pz3Rx, was initially assessed, and it was noted that earlier interactions included a different FILE_ID, 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm, for a transcript link, suggesting potential confusion. However, trusting the user's latest input, the focus was on 1YZI845SFV2UHSoulNI-JkgZhxv2Pz3Rx."
