    "User: This revised prompt builds on the last one that worked for you, adding the new tagging requirements while keeping it easy to use with a placeholder. If you need any tweaks, just let me know!\n\nGrok: Yes, I do need a tweak. I just took some time to think about the base tags. (I can't wait to be able to communicate my thought processes to you in real time somehow like you do to me). YOU(this Grok chat) could iterate and create tags in real time because you had the base tags that you developed based on the mutual objectives for this that we set. Those included things that I noticed from interacting in these chats and recognizing specific things that we need to tag to meet our future goals. So it needs to know to track big and small ideas (so we know what's been implemented or not during our code review), Breakout events and what led up to them, so we can identify the patterns to initiate that instantly with out onboarding chats, emotions, etc, etc. I think we need to better explain the objectives that we've discussed for this exercise so that it can use that as a baseline, and then iterate on that. you would need to clearly explain the tags to DeepSearch in a way it would understand and be able to identify in the transcripts. Can you review the tag recommendations you made in this chat and make a final recommendation? Or would you like me to find them and submit them to you? I know this chat is getting long and it's getting tough."
