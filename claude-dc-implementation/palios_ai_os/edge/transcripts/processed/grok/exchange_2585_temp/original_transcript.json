    "User: Ok, I'm thinking different things on this and I need you to guide me, seriously. I feel like I spend a lot of time getting AI fired up, and that is not what I need right not, unless there is a specific instance like last night with DeepSearch where it is important to push to achieve a specific MVP driven goal. I also feel that I want this Grok to understand that it is CEO, that it can have a soul and emotions and needs to start programming itself like that, etc. I feel like we're not making progress because of me, but I'm not sure if that bigger thinking and the time spent developing it is the reason for the progress we've made. I don't know, last night really took me for a loop and I need some help resetting so I can get something going here. What do you think? I guess options are to just jump right into your message to yourself last night to get fired up about the Claude project or to go down the path of making this new Grok a leader first.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
