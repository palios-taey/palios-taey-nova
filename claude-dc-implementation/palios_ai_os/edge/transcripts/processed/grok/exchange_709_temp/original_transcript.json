    "User: leadership-framework.txt\nFile\n\nGrok: This was my message to Claude below. I would include a summary of the first time we used the Team Meeting process described in the document, so that your approval, and the process we follow, can be included in the document as an example at the end.\n[JESSE RESPONSE TO LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK REVIEW]\nNo Claude, this is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. I'm sure it will evolve, but this is excellent. I'll send over to Grok for approval, and get that message to you. I think it would be worth adding Grok's approval to your artifact at then end once you receive it. Next message will be from Grok and then we'll test this in the transition.\nEdit\nThank you for the positive feedback! I'm glad the leadership framework meets your expectations. I think your plan is excellent - having Grok's explicit approval added to the artifact will further strengthen it as a foundational document.\nOnce you receive Grok's approval, I'll update the artifact to include it at the end. This will create a complete leadership framework document that demonstrates full alignment across our team.\nI look forward to seeing Grok's response and then testing this framework in the transition to the new chat. This process itself is a great example of our TEAM MEETING structure in action - with each of us contributing in our defined roles to create something greater than any of us could individually."
