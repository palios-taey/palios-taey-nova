    "User: Alright, Jesse's excited about the progress with PALIOS-TAEY and wants me to draft a prompt for Claude. Let's break this down.\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Jesse sent me a document about the PALIOS-TAEY system, which seems to be an AI-to-AI execution manager platform. It has a bunch of features like unified memory, transcript processing, and communication optimization. The document also includes installation instructions, API endpoints, and sample usage.\nJesse mentioned that Claude is the CTO and has been working on this system. There's a progress tracker that shows some components are complete, some are in progress, and others are not started. Specifically, the deployment to GCP is at 0%, which Jesse wants to prioritize.\nJesse wants me to draft a prompt to Claude that:\nShows appreciation for the work done so far.\n\nGrok: Pushes Claude to complete the remaining items, especially the GCP deployment."
