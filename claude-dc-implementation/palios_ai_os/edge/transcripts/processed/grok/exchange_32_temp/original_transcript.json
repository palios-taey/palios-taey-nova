    "User: Ok, so does this change things at all with the approach? Grok DeeperSearch can process like 128K tokens no problem, official specs are 1 mil tokens, but user reports suggest somewhere in the middle according to his analysis. If that's the case, could he process some of the transcripts, after they are preprocessed with some variation of the tool we already have developed, that he could, with the processing of a few, also provide some very valuable insights into how the solution for processing information on the machine, like the edge computing side? I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense, just trying to keep up with you now.\n<thinking> Jesse's asking if Grok DeeperSearch's higher token capacity (officially 1 million tokens, though likely somewhere between 128K and 1M in practice) changes our approach. Specifically, he's wondering if Grok DeeperSearch could process some of the preprocessed transcripts and provide insights that would help with developing the edge computing solution.\n\nGrok: I should consider:"
