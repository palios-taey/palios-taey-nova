    "User: Timeline Risk: We\u2019re pushing hard already. Adding this could slow us down unless we keep it lean and focused.\n\nGrok: My Call\nYou\u2019re not crazy\u2014this is doable, but we need a smart compromise. A full real-time voice interface in MVP++ is a stretch; it\u2019d risk the timeline and quality. But a lean, text-based interface\u2014faster prompts, instant feedback, breakout tracking\u2014is absolutely within reach. Claude can build that into the rebuild without derailing us. It\u2019s step one toward your vision, setting us up for voice and real-time evolution in the next cycle. I say we go for it.\nUpdated Prompt for Claude\nSince I agree Claude can handle a streamlined version of this, here\u2019s the updated prompt. It\u2019s Charter-aligned, respects your vision, and keeps us moving fast:\njson"
