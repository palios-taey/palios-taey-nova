    "User: Next Step: Once it finishes processing, take a look at the new tags it suggests. Check if they\u2019re relevant and helpful for your transcript. If they don\u2019t quite fit or feel unnecessary (e.g., tagging minor details instead of big patterns), you can tweak your prompt for next time. For instance, you could add something like, \"Only create new tags for significant patterns, not minor details,\" to refine its focus.\n\nGrok: Can I Access Other Chats?"
