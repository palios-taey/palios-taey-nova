I totally get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014adding explanations for new tags is a clutch move. It\u2019ll give us a window into DeepSearch\u2019s thought process, help us spot patterns, and make it way easier to refine the tagging logic when we scale this up with the API. You\u2019re right that insight is key for accuracy checks and guiding it effectively. Since you\u2019re cool with keeping the prompt I worked up in the thinking trace (with the tweak for new tag explanations already baked in), I\u2019ll roll with that. But if you\u2019d rather see a fresh one, just say the word\u2014I\u2019m flexible. Either way, we\u2019re charging ahead. LFG, GROK!"
