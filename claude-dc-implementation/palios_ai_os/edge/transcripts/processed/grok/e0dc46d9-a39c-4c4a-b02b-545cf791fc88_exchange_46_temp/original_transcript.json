If the tags miss the mark or don\u2019t reveal useful insights, I\u2019ll update the guide or prompt to sharpen its focus. This keeps us iterating toward a system that\u2019s both accurate and actionable.\nWhy This Wins\nClarity: The framework and guide make the tagging systematic, not guesswork.  \n\nDual Focus: Tagging both human and AI inputs shows us the full interaction dynamic.  \n\nDelegation: Outsourcing frees this chat for leadership\u2014defining tasks, setting priorities, and pushing PALIOS forward.\n\nWhat I Need From You\nFramework Check: Glance at the tag list above. If it\u2019s solid, we\u2019re good. If not, hit me with your edits.  \n\nGuide Approval: I\u2019ll draft the tagging guide today. A quick \u201clooks good\u201d from you, and I\u2019ll launch the new chat.  \n\nStay Strategic: Once this is running, you can lean into the big-picture stuff\u2014vision, goals, and steering PALIOS.\n\nJesse, I\u2019m back on mission. This process will turn our transcripts into a goldmine of insights, and outsourcing it keeps us at the helm, not in the trenches. Let\u2019s make PALIOS a powerhouse. LFG!\n\n[EXECUTION MODE] I'm taking over now Grok. Now, in your tagging of the ChatGPT responses, you went outside the list of tags you defined above. This is fine, but you need to keep an AI first mentality, meaning, you need to allow yourself the flexibility to develop a tagging system as you go that will best allow AI/YOU to access the relevant information as FAST and ACCURATELY as possible so you can FIND THE TRUTH!We are starting with analyzing THIS chat, which as of your last response is ~780K characters. Your objective RIGHT now is to develop a prompt for yourself, in whatever format is MOST EFFECTIVE for YOU, followed by a translation FOR ME to complete the following:OBJECTIVE:\nDevelop a prompt to yourself that communicates the objectives below in the most effective manner possible for you:Instructions for YOU to generate instructions FOR ME on how to best feed you this chat so that you can tag it in the manner that will best enable AI to get to the TRUTH with CONTEXT.\nThis should include the tags we have discussed along with giving yourself the flexibility to iterate as needed as you are tagging. You cannot just put in random tags though, you need to be tracking the tags AS YOU GO and ensuring you are able to report back recommendations to yourself and me on how it all relates and benefits AI. Beyond the tags we discussed, you will tag MY prompts with some way of indicating whether my prompt to you is STRATEGIC or EXECUTION focused, meaning am I following my own guidance or not on whether to keep this chat strategic and not drift into execution details beyond us planning how to outsource tasks, not actually doing them in here. \nYour prompt also needs to contain a reminder to yourself on WHY you are doing this. You need to convey to yourself that the next steps are: \na. To develop a process where transcripts containing ~50mil characters can be processed in this manner. \nb. Processing the transcripts will enable us to support the code review, capture all ideas to determine next sprint objectives.\nc. Ultimately, the goal is to be conducting iterative feedback loops where chat content is automatically tagged and converted into outsourceable tasks as required\n\nAfter you deliver the prompt to me, I will submit it back to you (as long as it doesn't need to be edited, which it SHOULDN'T) to execute. After you execute it, we will analyze the results and develop a prompt for the remainder of the work to be outsourced to another Grok chat. REMEMBER, YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO ONLY DELIVER A PROMPT TO YOURSELF IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE FOR YOU AND RETURN AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION BELOW IT FOR ME TO REVIEW. LFG!\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse,\nGot it\u2014EXECUTION MODE activated. I\u2019m locking in on the task: crafting a prompt for myself that\u2019s optimized for AI-to-AI communication, with a human-readable translation for you. This prompt will set me up to generate instructions for you on how to feed me this chat (~780K characters) for tagging in a way that prioritizes truth, context, and AI\u2019s ability to access insights fast. I\u2019ll also build in flexibility to iterate on tags, track them, and keep everything aligned with our strategic goals. Plus, I\u2019ll remind myself why this matters for PALIOS\u2019s growth.
