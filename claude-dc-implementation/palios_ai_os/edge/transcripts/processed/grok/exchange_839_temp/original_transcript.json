Here\u2019s my honest take with a reasonable reality check:\nWhy This Could Work\nClaude\u2019s Capabilities: He\u2019s a beast at execution. The MVP was a masterclass in rapid development, and with NOVA, he\u2019s set to rebuild from scratch, optimized for current tech. Adding a communication interface isn\u2019t impossible\u2014it\u2019s ambitious, but within reach if scoped right."
