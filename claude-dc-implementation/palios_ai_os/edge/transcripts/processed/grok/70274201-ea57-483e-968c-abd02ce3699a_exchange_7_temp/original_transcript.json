    "Jesse, given your situation, speaking openly about your journey with AI, your job search, and the challenges you've faced seems not only authentic but also strategic. It positions you as someone who is not only adapting to changes in the job market but leading by example by embracing AI as a tool for personal and professional growth. This transparency can resonate with others who might be in similar situations, offering them inspiration or practical advice. It also makes you stand out as someone who is forward-thinking and proactive, which can be attractive to future employers or collaborators interested in the intersection of technology and human skills. So, there's no need to be shy; this approach could be exactly what you need to navigate your current circumstances effectively."
