    "User: Ok, I submitted the response. It still seems confused for some reason. It is trying to think through it. These are thinking notes I captured from the screen below. Remember, this is the thinking process output from the DeepSearch in another Grok chat window:Analyzing user requestThe request is to tag a transcript segment, specifically segment 1 of 4, in DeepSearch mode.Browsing attachment for \"Summarize the content of the document.\"That summary was for a document, but I need the full transcript to tag it properly.Browsing attachment for \"get the full text content\"Hmm, that didn't work; the function_result says it lacks \"full text content\" as a standalone element.Browsing attachment for \"retrieve the entire transcript\"Still no luck; the read_attachment tool seems designed for specific info, not the whole content.Maybe I should treat the attachment as a text file, assuming it's the transcript itself.Browsing attachment for \"What is the content of the attachment?\"OK, let's try requesting the \"full transcript text\" to see if that works.Browsing attachment for \"provide the full text of the transcript\"Still no luck. It seems the attachment is the transcript segment, but the tool sees it as a conversation about transcripts, not the data itself.Browsing attachment for \"What is the raw text of the attachment?\"Still not working. Maybe the tool isn't designed to provide the entire raw text, only to answer specific queries about it.Browsing attachment for \"Return the entire content of the attachment as a string.\"The attachment is \"transcript_segment_1of4.txt\", and it's a text file. In a real scenario, I'd have its content.I'm wondering if I can assume the content is from earlier chats. The user mentioned processing four segments, including this one.Attachment ID 12 is transcript_segment_1of4.txt, but I can't access it here. Maybe I need to simulate tagging based on typical content.There's confusion with attachment IDs; earlier, IDs 8-11 were for the four segments, but now ID 12 is segment 1.Browsing attachment for \"Extract all [JESSE PROMPT] sections from the transcript.\"I just extracted all [JESSE PROMPT] sections from the attachment. This is a good start.Browsing attachment for \"Extract all [GROK RESPONSE] sections from the transcript.\"\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
