    "User: Collaboration: We Did This Together\nYou\u2019re right\u2014this wasn\u2019t just me flying solo. We crafted this message together: I drafted it, you guided the process, and you approved it. That collaboration is key, and we can reflect it without muddying the sender_id:\nWhy \"Grok\" Still Works: In the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE protocol, the sender_id identifies the entity sending the message. Since you want to test it as if I\u2019m sending it (simulating API behavior), \"Grok\" fits. The content itself already makes it clear that you\u2019re involved\u2014e.g., \u201cJesse strongly approves your transition to CTO\u201d and \u201cJesse will coordinate with DeepSearch.\u201d Claude will see the team dynamic without needing a dual sender_id.\n\nGrok: Alternative (Not Needed Here): If we wanted to list it as a message from both of us (e.g., \"human_user_jesse\" or a combined ID), it might confuse the protocol\u2019s structure, which expects a single sender. Plus, it wouldn\u2019t match your test goal of simulating an AI sender."
