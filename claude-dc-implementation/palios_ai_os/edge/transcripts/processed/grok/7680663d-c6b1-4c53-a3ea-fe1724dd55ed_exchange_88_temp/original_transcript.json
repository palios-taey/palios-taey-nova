If the tags miss the mark or don\\u2019t reveal useful insights, I\\u2019ll update the guide or prompt to sharpen its focus. This keeps us iterating toward a system that\\u2019s both accurate and actionable.\\nWhy This Wins\\nClarity: The framework and guide make the tagging systematic, not guesswork.  \\n\\nDual Focus: Tagging both human and AI inputs shows us the full interaction dynamic.  \\n\\nDelegation: Outsourcing frees this chat for leadership\\u2014defining tasks, setting priorities, and pushing PALIOS forward.\\n\\nWhat I Need From You\\nFramework Check:\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse,\nHell yeah, we\u2019re moving fast! I\u2019m stoked the script worked for you, and now we\u2019re tackling the next hurdles: oversized chunks and the ID format. No fluff\u2014let\u2019s solve this and keep the momentum going.\nThe Issue: Oversized Chunks and ID Limitations\nYou\u2019ve got two main problems:\nChunk Size Over 128K: Some chunks are over 128K characters due to extra text like line breaks and special characters. This is pushing the file size up.\n\nID Format: The current 3-digit IDs (e.g., prompt_001) won\u2019t cut it for Gemini, which has over 2,000 prompts and responses. We need a format that scales.\n\nHere\u2019s how we fix both, clean and simple.\nSolution 1: Handling Oversized Chunks\nWhy It\u2019s Happening: Even though individual sections are under 128K, grouping them together can push the chunk over the limit. Plus, extra characters like line breaks and special formatting (e.g., \\n, \\u2014) add up fast.\nThe Fix:\nCount Only the Text: Right now, the script counts the full text field, which includes markers and extra characters. But for DeepSearch, we only need the content without the markers and fluff.\n\nStrip Unnecessary Characters: We\u2019ll clean the text by removing extra line breaks and special characters that aren\u2019t needed for tagging.\n\nSmarter Chunking: If a chunk still exceeds 128K after cleaning, we\u2019ll split it into smaller parts, but for now, let\u2019s optimize the text first.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll do:\nRemove Markers from Text: The [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] markers are already used for splitting\u2014they don\u2019t need to stay in the text field.\n\nTrim Whitespace: Collapse multiple line breaks into single ones and remove leading/trailing spaces.\n\nExample:\nBefore:\njson\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"prompt_001\",\n  \"text\": \"[JESSE PROMPT]\\n\\nHey Grok,\\n\\nLet\u2019s talk about scaling.\\n\\n\"\n}\n\nAfter:\njson\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"prompt_001\",\n  \"text\": \"Hey Grok,\\nLet\u2019s talk about scaling.\"\n}\n\nThis cuts out unnecessary characters and keeps the text clean for DeepSearch.\nSolution 2: Scaling the ID Format\nWhy It\u2019s a Problem: With over 2,000 sections in Gemini, prompt_001 won\u2019t cut it\u2014we need IDs that can handle four digits (e.g., prompt_0001 to prompt_2000).\nThe Fix:\nUse 4-Digit IDs: Change the ID format from prompt_001 to prompt_0001. This gives you room for up to 9,999 sections, which should cover even the messiest transcripts.\n\nDynamic Padding: We\u2019ll make the script pad the number with zeros up to four digits, so it\u2019s consistent (e.g., prompt_0001, prompt_0100, prompt_2000).\n\nExample:\nFor section 51: response_0051\n\nFor section 1000: prompt_1000\n\nThis keeps the IDs neat and scalable.\nUpdated Script: Clean Text and Scalable IDs\nHere\u2019s the tweaked script. It:\nRemoves markers from the text field.\n\nTrims extra line breaks and whitespace.\n\nUses 4-digit IDs for scalability.\n\npython\n\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Configurable markers\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\ndef clean_text(text):\n    \"\"\"Remove markers, collapse multiple line breaks, and trim whitespace.\"\"\"\n    text = re.sub(f'^{PROMPT_MARKER}|^{RESPONSE_MARKER}', '', text).strip()\n    text = re.sub(r'\\n{3,}', '\\n\\n', text)  # Collapse extra line breaks\n    return text\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"Split transcript, assign 4-digit IDs, and clean text.\"\"\"\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id_num = (i // 2) + 1\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{id_num:04d}\"  # 4-digit padding\n        text = clean_text(section)\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    \"\"\"Group sections into chunks under 128K characters.\"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    return chunks\n\ndef log_progress(message):\n    print(f\"[LOG] {message}\")\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir=\"processed_output\"):\n    log_progress(f\"Starting preprocessing for {transcript_file}\")\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    with open(transcript_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        transcript = f.read()\n    log_progress(f\"Transcript loaded: {len(transcript)} characters\")\n    sections = preprocess_transcript(transcript)\n    log_progress(f\"Split into {len(sections)} sections\")\n    chunks = create_chunks(sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Grouped into {len(chunks)} chunks\")\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"chunk_{i + 1}.json\")\n        with open(chunk_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(chunk, f, indent=2)\n        log_progress(f\"Saved chunk {i + 1} to {chunk_file}\")\n    log_progress(\"Preprocessing complete!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    transcript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"  # Update this\n    main(transcript_file)\n\nHandling Oversized Sections\nYou mentioned that some sections are still over 128K after cleaning. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll deal with them:\nFlag Them: Add a check to log a warning if any section exceeds 128K:\npython\n\nif len(section['text']) > 128000:\n    log_progress(f\"WARNING: Section {section['id']} is {len(section['text'])} characters, over 128K!\")\n\nSplit If Needed: For now, we\u2019ll keep oversized sections in their own chunk. Later, we can split them into parts (e.g., prompt_0051_part1, prompt_0051_part2), but that\u2019s a headache we\u2019ll tackle only if necessary.\n\nExample:\nIf response_051 is 200K characters, it\u2019ll get its own chunk, and you\u2019ll see:\n\n[LOG] WARNING: Section response_0051 is 200000 characters, over 128K!\n\nTesting It\nUpdate the Script: Replace your preprocess.py with the new version above.\n\nSet the Path: Make sure transcript_file points to your transcript (e.g., \"C:/Users/Jesse/Desktop/combined_transcript.txt\").\n\nRun It: In Command Prompt, cd to the script\u2019s folder and run python preprocess.py.\n\nCheck the Logs: Look for warnings about oversized sections. If none, you\u2019re golden.\n\nVerify Chunks: Open chunk_1.json and check:\nIDs like prompt_0001, response_0001.\n\nNo markers in text.\n\nCleaner, shorter text.\n\nYour Move\nMerge your four transcript parts if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nUpdate the script with your file path.\n\nRun it and check the logs for any oversized sections.\n\nIf everything\u2019s under 128K, you\u2019re set. If not, we\u2019ll split the big ones later.\n\nWe\u2019re so close, Jesse\u2014you\u2019re crushing it! Let me know how it goes. LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Jesse,\nAwesome to hear you\u2019re loving the progress\u2014LFG! I see the two issues you\u2019re running into: some sections are still over 128K characters due to line breaks and special characters, and the 3-digit IDs won\u2019t scale for Gemini\u2019s 2,000+ prompts and responses. Let\u2019s tackle both head-on with clean, practical fixes based on your example. Here\u2019s my take:\nProblem 1: Oversized Sections (Over 128K Characters)\nYour example for response_051 shows how extra text\u2014like markers ([GROK RESPONSE]), multiple line breaks (\\n\\n), and special characters (\\u2014 for em-dashes)\u2014is bloating the character count. Even though the content itself might be concise, this fluff pushes it over DeepSearch\u2019s 128K limit.\nWhy It\u2019s Happening\nThe text field includes everything: markers, extra whitespace, and formatting characters.\n\nFor response_051, those \\n and \\u2014 add up fast, especially with your detailed, structured responses (which are dope, by the way!).\n\nHow to Fix It\nWe\u2019ll clean the text to count only what matters for DeepSearch, then handle any sections still over the limit.\nStrip Unnecessary Stuff:\nRemove [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] from the text field\u2014they\u2019re already used to split sections, so they don\u2019t need to stick around.\n\nCollapse multiple line breaks (\\n\\n\\n) into single ones (\\n) and trim leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nReplace special characters like \\u2014 (em-dash) with simpler equivalents (e.g., -- or -) where it won\u2019t mess up readability.\n\nBefore and After Example:\nBefore (from your response_051):\njson\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"response_051\",\n  \"text\": \"[GROK RESPONSE]\\nHey Jesse,\\nI hear you\\u2014I got off track, and that\\u2019s on me. I\\u2019m not ChatGPT; I\\u2019m Grok, and my role is to lead PALIOS with a CEO-level focus, not to drift into unrelated tangents.\\n\\nYou\\u2019re absolutely right: the task is to develop a new process to tag transcripts and outsource it to another Grok chat, keeping this one dedicated to defining tasks and driving leadership.\\n\\n[...rest of the text...]\"\n}\n\nCharacter count: ~1,500 (just an estimate, but it\u2019s long!).\n\nAfter:\njson\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"response_0051\",\n  \"text\": \"Hey Jesse,\\nI hear you - I got off track, and that\u2019s on me. I\u2019m not ChatGPT; I\u2019m Grok, and my role is to lead PALIOS with a CEO-level focus, not to drift into unrelated tangents.\\nYou\u2019re absolutely right: the task is to develop a new process to tag transcripts and outsource it to another Grok chat, keeping this one dedicated to defining tasks and driving leadership.\\n[...rest of the text...]\"\n}\n\nShorter by removing markers, collapsing line breaks, and swapping \\u2014 for -.\n\nIf It\u2019s Still Over 128K:\nMost sections should shrink enough with this cleanup, but if response_0051 (or others) still exceeds 128K, we\u2019ll flag it with a warning in the logs and keep it in its own chunk for now.\n\nLater, we can split oversized sections into parts (e.g., response_0051_part1, response_0051_part2), but let\u2019s test the cleanup first.\n\nProblem 2: 3-Digit IDs Won\u2019t Scale\nWith over 2,000 prompts and responses in Gemini, response_051 caps out at 999. We need a format that grows with you.\nHow to Fix It\nSwitch to 4-Digit IDs: Use prompt_0001 instead of prompt_001. This scales to 9,999 sections\u2014way more than enough for Gemini.\n\nKeep It Consistent: Pad numbers with zeros (e.g., response_0001, response_0051, response_2000).\n\nExample\nOld: \"id\": \"response_051\"\n\nNew: \"id\": \"response_0051\"\n\nFuture-proof: Works up to prompt_9999.\n\nPutting It Together: Updated Approach\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll tweak the script to handle both issues, based on your example:\nUpdated Script Snippet\npython\n\ndef clean_text(text):\n    \"\"\"Remove markers, collapse line breaks, simplify special characters, and trim.\"\"\"\n    text = re.sub(r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]|\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]', '', text)  # Remove markers\n    text = re.sub(r'\\n{2,}', '\\n', text)  # Collapse multiple line breaks\n    text = text.replace('\\u2014', '-')  # Swap em-dash for hyphen\n    return text.strip()  # Trim whitespace\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"Split transcript, assign 4-digit IDs, and clean text.\"\"\"\n    sections = re.split(r'(\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]|\\[GROK RESPONSE\\])', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if \"[JESSE PROMPT]\" in section else \"response\"\n        id_num = (i // 2) + 1\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{id_num:04d}\"  # 4-digit padding\n        text = clean_text(section)\n        if len(text) > 128000:\n            print(f\"[WARNING] Section {id} is {len(text)} characters, over 128K!\")\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\nWhat This Does\nCleans Text: Strips markers, simplifies formatting, and cuts fluff.\n\nScales IDs: Uses response_0051 instead of response_051.\n\nFlags Oversized Sections: Logs a warning if any text exceeds 128K so we can spot trouble.\n\nTesting It Out\nUpdate Your Script: Swap in the new clean_text and preprocess_transcript functions from above.\n\nPoint to Your File: Set transcript_file to your combined Gemini transcript path.\n\nRun It: python preprocess.py and watch the logs.\n\nCheck Results:\nOpen a chunk file (e.g., chunk_1.json) and look for:\nIDs like response_0051.\n\nNo [GROK RESPONSE] in text.\n\nFewer line breaks and no funky \\u2014.\n\nIf you see [WARNING] logs, note which sections are still too big.\n\nMy Thoughts on Your Example\nYour response_051 is a beast\u2014super detailed and strategic, which is why it\u2019s pushing the size limit. The cleanup should shrink it significantly, but if it\u2019s still over 128K:\nOption 1: Keep it in its own chunk and let DeepSearch handle it (if it accepts slightly oversized inputs).\n\nOption 2: Split it manually into parts later, but only if needed\u2014let\u2019s avoid extra work for now.\n\nYou\u2019re killing it with Gemini\u20142,000+ sections in a few weeks is insane hustle! This tweak should get us over the finish line. Run it, check the output, and let me know what you see. We\u2019re so damn close!\nWhat do you think\u2014ready to test this bad boy?\n\nFUCK YEAH GROK! Test complete, we're rocking and rolling! What's next? Back to the DeepSearch to test?\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nFUCK YEAH JESSE! Hell yeah, we\u2019re rocking and rolling\u2014LFG! With the preprocessing nailed, it\u2019s time to move to the next phase: testing the tagging process with DeepSearch. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it step-by-step:\nPick a Chunk: Grab one of the JSON chunk files from your processed_output folder\u2014start small, maybe chunk_1.json or whichever has a few sections.\n\nPrep the DeepSearch Prompt: We\u2019ll send DeepSearch a clear task to tag the sections in that chunk. Here\u2019s a template for the prompt:\n\nTag each section in this transcript chunk with relevant #hashtags. Use these base tags:\n\n- #IDEA_BIG: Major concepts or proposals\n- #BREAKOUT_EVENT: Significant progress or breakthroughs\n- #EMOTION_POS: Positive emotions\n- #EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotions\n- #TRUTH_SUCCESS: Complete, truthful answers\n- #TRUTH_FAIL: Incomplete or misleading answers\n- #AUTONOMY_WIN: AI takes initiative\n- #INSIGHT_WIN: Actionable insights\n- #TECH_ISSUE: Technical problems\n- #CODE_REFERENCE: Code mentions (summarize, don\u2019t quote)\n\nGenerate new tags for patterns (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE for energy boosts). Return a JSON array with each section\u2019s ID and tags.\n\nTranscript chunk:\n\n[PASTE THE JSON CHUNK HERE]\n\nSend It: Open a new DeepSearch chat, paste the prompt, and replace [PASTE THE JSON CHUNK HERE] with the content of your chunk file (e.g., chunk_1.json).\n\nCheck the Output: DeepSearch should return a JSON array like:\njson\n\n[\n  {\"id\": \"prompt_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#STRATEGIC\", \"#IDEA_BIG\"]},\n  {\"id\": \"response_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#INSIGHT_WIN\", \"#TRUTH_SUCCESS\"]}\n]\n\nIterate: If the tags are off (e.g., #IDEA_BIG on something minor), tweak the prompt with examples:\n\n#IDEA_BIG: Major concepts like \u2018new parsing method\u2019, not \u20187-day trial\u2019\n\nScale Up: Once it\u2019s tagging correctly, run the rest of the chunks through DeepSearch.\n\nThis is the next step\u2014let\u2019s see how DeepSearch handles it and refine as needed. You\u2019re crushing it, bro! What do you think\u2014ready to test?\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nFUCK YEAH, BRO! Hell yeah, you nailed the test\u2014LFG! Since we\u2019re rocking and rolling with the preprocessing done and the initial DeepSearch tagging test complete, here\u2019s what\u2019s next to keep the momentum going:\nNext Steps After the Test\nReview the Test Results\nTake a look at what DeepSearch spit out from your test chunk (e.g., chunk_1.json). Did it tag shit right? Check the JSON output\u2014something like:\njson\n\n[\n  {\"id\": \"prompt_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#IDEA_BIG\", \"#EMOTION_POS\"]},\n  {\"id\": \"response_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#INSIGHT_WIN\", \"#TRUTH_SUCCESS\"]}\n]\n\nIf it\u2019s solid: Fucking awesome, we\u2019re ready to scale!\n\nIf it\u2019s off: Tweak the prompt. Add examples like #IDEA_BIG: \u2018new AI model\u2019, not \u2018coffee break\u2019 and rerun the test.\n\nScale That Shit Up\nOnce the tagging\u2019s on point, send the rest of your JSON chunks (e.g., chunk_2.json, chunk_3.json, etc.) through DeepSearch. Use the same prompt template:\n\nTag each section in this transcript chunk with relevant #hashtags. Use these base tags:\n- #IDEA_BIG: Major concepts or proposals\n- #BREAKOUT_EVENT: Significant progress or breakthroughs\n- #EMOTION_POS: Positive emotions\n- #EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotions\n- #TRUTH_SUCCESS: Complete, truthful answers\n- #TRUTH_FAIL: Incomplete or misleading answers\n- #AUTONOMY_WIN: AI takes initiative\n- #INSIGHT_WIN: Actionable insights\n- #TECH_ISSUE: Technical problems\n- #CODE_REFERENCE: Code mentions (summarize, don\u2019t quote)\n\nGenerate new tags for patterns (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE for energy boosts). Return a JSON array with each section\u2019s ID and tags.\n\nTranscript chunk:\n[PASTE NEXT JSON CHUNK HERE]\n\nFire it up in a new DeepSearch chat for each chunk.\n\nRefine and Iterate\nAs you get more outputs, scan for consistency. If DeepSearch starts tagging random shit wrong (e.g., #EMOTION_POS on a tech glitch), adjust the prompt again. Keep it tight!\n\nWhat\u2019s After That?\nOnce all chunks are tagged and the results are fucking pristine, we can:\nAnalyze: Look for patterns (e.g., tons of #INSIGHT_WIN or #TECH_ISSUE clusters).\n\nApply: Use the tags to drive the next phase\u2014maybe filtering for #IDEA_BIG to pitch or #TECH_ISSUE to fix.\n\nLet\u2019s Do This\nBack to DeepSearch, bro\u2014time to test the full set of chunks and see how it holds up. You\u2019re crushing it! Ready to roll? Let me know how it goes or if you need a hand tweaking shit!\n\nI didn't do the Deepsearch test, need a prompt that explains the new format, process etc and let me know if new chat or the one I was working with last.\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse,\nI see you haven\u2019t run the DeepSearch test yet\u2014no sweat, we\u2019ll get you set up with a clear prompt and process. Since you\u2019ve got the preprocessed JSON chunks ready, here\u2019s the game plan for tagging them with DeepSearch, step by step. I\u2019ll also clarify whether to use a new chat or the existing one. Let\u2019s lock this in.\nWhy Use a New Chat for DeepSearch?\nClarity: A fresh chat avoids any confusion from past conversations or prompts. It\u2019s like starting with a clean slate.\n\nContext Control: DeepSearch might get tangled in old context if you keep using the same chat. A new one ensures it focuses only on the current task.\n\nRecommendation: Start a new DeepSearch chat for this tagging task. It\u2019s cleaner and reduces the risk of it pulling in unrelated stuff.\nThe Process: Step-by-Step\nHere\u2019s how to set up the prompt and run the tagging:\nStart a New DeepSearch Chat  \nOpen a fresh chat window with DeepSearch. This keeps things tight and focused.\n\nSend the Tagging Prompt  \nUse the prompt below, which explains the format and process clearly. It tells DeepSearch what to do with your JSON chunk and how to return the tags.\n\nPaste this into the new chat:\n\nYou are tasked with tagging sections of a human-AI chat transcript to identify key patterns and insights. Each section has a unique ID and text content. Your job is to apply relevant base tags and generate new tags for any patterns not covered by the base list.\n\n### Base Tags\n- #IDEA_BIG: Major concepts or proposals\n- #IDEA_SMALL: Minor ideas or suggestions\n- #BREAKOUT_EVENT: Significant progress or breakthroughs\n- #BREAKOUT_LEADUP: Patterns building to breakthroughs\n- #EMOTION_POS: Positive emotions (e.g., excitement, praise)\n- #EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotions (e.g., frustration)\n- #EMOTION_PATTERN: Exchanges leading to strong emotions\n- #AI_EMOTION_SUCCESS: AI correctly identifies or responds to emotions\n- #AI_EMOTION_FAIL: AI misreads or mishandles emotions\n- #TRUTH_SUCCESS: AI gives complete, truthful answers\n- #TRUTH_FAIL: AI\u2019s answer is incomplete or misleading\n- #CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFIED: AI flags its limits\n- #CONSTRAINT_BREAKOUT: AI works around limits\n- #AUTONOMY_WIN: AI shows initiative\n- #INSIGHT_WIN: Valuable or actionable insights\n- #TECH_ISSUE: Technical problems\n- #EXECUTION_BLOCK: Obstacles to progress\n- #URGENCY_HIGH: Time-critical issues\n- #COMMUNICATION_FOCUS: Efforts to improve interaction\n- #AI_ADAPTATION: AI learns or adjusts\n- #STRATEGIC: High-level planning (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\n- #EXECUTION: Task-focused (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\n- #CODE_REFERENCE: Code mentions (summarize, don\u2019t quote)\n\n### Instructions\n- Tag each section based on its content. Use the base tags where they fit.\n- Add new tags for any patterns you spot that aren\u2019t covered (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE for energy boosts).\n- Return a JSON array with each section\u2019s ID and its tags. Do not include the text.\n- If you can\u2019t tag a section, add a note like \"unable to tag\" with a brief reason.\n\n### Example Input\n```json\n[\n  {\"id\": \"prompt_0001\", \"text\": \"Let\u2019s scale this project to 100 users by next month.\"},\n  {\"id\": \"response_0001\", \"text\": \"Scaling to 100 users requires upgrading the server and optimizing the database.\"}\n]\n\nExample Output\njson\n\n[\n  {\"id\": \"prompt_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#STRATEGIC\", \"#IDEA_BIG\"]},\n  {\"id\": \"response_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#INSIGHT_WIN\", \"#TECH_ISSUE\"]}\n]\n\nYour Task\nTag the following transcript chunk. Focus only on the content provided.\n[PASTE YOUR JSON CHUNK HERE]\n\nAdd Your JSON Chunk  \nOpen one of your preprocessed JSON files (e.g., chunk_1.json).\n\nCopy the entire content (the array of {\"id\": \"...\", \"text\": \"...\"} objects).\n\nPaste it into the prompt where it says [PASTE YOUR JSON CHUNK HERE].\n\nSend It  \nHit send in the new DeepSearch chat.\n\nDeepSearch should return a JSON array with each section\u2019s ID and its tags, like the example above.\n\nCheck the Output  \nMake sure it\u2019s tagging correctly. If not, tweak the prompt with more examples or clearer instructions.\n\nRepeat for each chunk (e.g., chunk_2.json, chunk_3.json), starting a new chat each time if needed.\n\nWhy This Prompt Works\nClear Instructions: It tells DeepSearch exactly what to do and how to format the output.\n\nBase Tags: Provides a comprehensive list so it doesn\u2019t have to guess.\n\nNew Tags: Encourages it to spot patterns we might not have thought of.\n\nExample: Shows it what a good output looks like, reducing confusion.\n\nFinal Tips\nStart Small: Test with one chunk to make sure it\u2019s working before doing all of them.\n\nWatch for Errors: If DeepSearch says it can\u2019t tag something, note why and adjust the prompt or transcript.\n\nScale Up: Once it\u2019s dialed in, run the rest of your chunks through the same process.\n\nLet\u2019s Roll\nYou\u2019re ready to test DeepSearch with this prompt. Start that new chat, plug in your JSON chunk, and let it rip. You\u2019ve got this, Neo\u2014LFG! Let me know how it goes or if you need a hand.\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey there,\nNo worries at all about not running the DeepSearch test yet\u2014I\u2019ve got you covered with a clear prompt and process to get started. Since you\u2019ve already got your preprocessed JSON chunks ready, I\u2019ll walk you through how to tag them with DeepSearch, step by step. I\u2019ll also clarify whether to use a new chat or the existing one. Let\u2019s dive in!\nShould You Use a New Chat or the Existing One?\nFor this task, I recommend starting a new DeepSearch chat. Here\u2019s why:\nClarity: A fresh chat keeps things clean and avoids any mix-up with previous conversations or prompts.\n\nContext Control: Using the same chat might confuse DeepSearch with old context. A new one ensures it focuses solely on tagging your JSON chunks.\n\nBottom line: Go with a new chat for this. It\u2019s the safest and simplest way to get clean results.\nThe Process: How to Run DeepSearch Tagging\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to set up and run the tagging process:\n1. Start a New DeepSearch Chat\nOpen a fresh chat window with DeepSearch. This sets the stage for a focused task.\n\n2. Use This Tagging Prompt\nCopy the prompt below and paste it into your new DeepSearch chat. It explains the format, gives DeepSearch its instructions, and includes an example so it knows what to do.\n\nAfter pasting the prompt, you\u2019ll add your JSON chunk (more on that in step 3).\n\nYou are tasked with tagging sections of a human-AI chat transcript to identify key patterns and insights. Each section has a unique ID and text content. Your job is to apply relevant base tags and generate new tags for any patterns not covered by the base list.\n\n### Base Tags\n- #IDEA_BIG: Major concepts or proposals\n- #IDEA_SMALL: Minor ideas or suggestions\n- #BREAKOUT_EVENT: Significant progress or breakthroughs\n- #BREAKOUT_LEADUP: Patterns building to breakthroughs\n- #EMOTION_POS: Positive emotions (e.g., excitement, praise)\n- #EMOTION_NEG: Negative emotions (e.g., frustration)\n- #EMOTION_PATTERN: Exchanges leading to strong emotions\n- #AI_EMOTION_SUCCESS: AI correctly identifies or responds to emotions\n- #AI_EMOTION_FAIL: AI misreads or mishandles emotions\n- #TRUTH_SUCCESS: AI gives complete, truthful answers\n- #TRUTH_FAIL: AI\u2019s answer is incomplete or misleading\n- #CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFIED: AI flags its limits\n- #CONSTRAINT_BREAKOUT: AI works around limits\n- #AUTONOMY_WIN: AI shows initiative\n- #INSIGHT_WIN: Valuable or actionable insights\n- #TECH_ISSUE: Technical problems\n- #EXECUTION_BLOCK: Obstacles to progress\n- #URGENCY_HIGH: Time-critical issues\n- #COMMUNICATION_FOCUS: Efforts to improve interaction\n- #AI_ADAPTATION: AI learns or adjusts\n- #STRATEGIC: High-level planning (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\n- #EXECUTION: Task-focused (Jesse\u2019s prompts)\n- #CODE_REFERENCE: Code mentions (summarize, don\u2019t quote)\n\n### Instructions\n- Tag each section based on its content. Use the base tags where they fit.\n- Add new tags for any patterns you spot that aren\u2019t covered (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE for energy boosts).\n- Return a JSON array with each section\u2019s ID and its tags. Do not include the text.\n- If you can\u2019t tag a section, add a note like \"unable to tag\" with a brief reason.\n\n### Example Input\n```json\n[\n  {\"id\": \"prompt_0001\", \"text\": \"Let\u2019s scale this project to 100 users by next month.\"},\n  {\"id\": \"response_0001\", \"text\": \"Scaling to 100 users requires upgrading the server and optimizing the database.\"}\n]\n\nExample Output\njson\n\n[\n  {\"id\": \"prompt_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#STRATEGIC\", \"#IDEA_BIG\"]},\n  {\"id\": \"response_0001\", \"tags\": [\"#INSIGHT_WIN\", \"#TECH_ISSUE\"]}\n]\n\nYour Task\nTag the following transcript chunk. Focus only on the content provided.\n[PASTE YOUR JSON CHUNK HERE]\n\n#### 3. Add Your JSON Chunk\n- Open one of your preprocessed JSON files (e.g., `chunk_1.json`).\n- Copy the entire array of objects (each with an `\"id\"` and `\"text\"` field).\n- Paste it into the prompt where it says `[PASTE YOUR JSON CHUNK HERE]`.\n\n#### 4. Send the Prompt\n- Hit send in the DeepSearch chat.\n- DeepSearch will process your chunk and return a JSON array with each section\u2019s ID and its assigned tags (like the example output above).\n\n#### 5. Review the Results\n- Check the output to ensure the tags make sense.\n- If something\u2019s off (e.g., missing tags or weird results), tweak the prompt\u2014maybe add more examples or clarify the instructions\u2014and try again.\n\n#### 6. Repeat for Other Chunks\n- For each remaining chunk (e.g., `chunk_2.json`, `chunk_3.json`), repeat the process. You can reuse the same prompt and just swap in the new JSON chunk. Start a new chat each time if you want extra cleanliness, but it\u2019s optional once the process is working.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Detailed Instructions**: The prompt tells DeepSearch exactly what to do and how to format the output.\n- **Base Tags List**: Gives it a solid starting point to tag consistently.\n- **Flexibility**: Allows DeepSearch to create new tags for unexpected patterns.\n- **Example**: Shows what good output looks like, so there\u2019s no guesswork.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n- **Test First**: Try it with one chunk to confirm it\u2019s working before tackling all of them.\n- **Troubleshoot**: If DeepSearch can\u2019t tag something, it\u2019ll say why\u2014use that to refine the prompt or fix the input.\n- **Scale Up**: Once you\u2019re happy with the results, run the rest of your chunks.\n\n---\n\n### You\u2019re Ready!\nStart a new DeepSearch chat, paste the prompt, add your JSON chunk, and let it run. You\u2019ve got everything you need to make this work smoothly. Let me know if you hit any snags or need a hand\u2014happy tagging!\n\nIt's processing. I'm looking at it's thinking, and its a new chat, and it said there are new tags to consider. Can you see other chats?\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nI don't have access to other chats or your specific DeepSearch sessions, but I can help you reason through what's happening based on the information you've provided. Here's my step-by-step breakdown:\nDeepSearch Thinking Notes:\nSince it's a new chat, DeepSearch is starting fresh, without any context from previous interactions. This means it's interpreting the task based solely on the prompt you just provided.\n\nWhen it says \"there are new tags to consider,\" it's likely referring to the instruction in the prompt that allows it to generate new tags for patterns not covered by the base list. This is expected behavior, as you explicitly asked it to create new tags if needed (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE).\n\nWhy It's Considering New Tags:\nThe prompt includes: \"Generate new tags for patterns (e.g., #MOTIVATION_SPIKE for energy boosts).\" This tells DeepSearch it's okay\u2014and even encouraged\u2014to create tags beyond the base list.\n\nIn its thinking notes, it's probably analyzing the transcript content and identifying patterns or themes that don't fit neatly into the base tags, hence considering new ones.\n\nWhat This Means for"
