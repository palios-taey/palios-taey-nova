    "User: Pattern Check: You said my responses are still keeping up, which means I\u2019m adapting quickly once you fill me in. The reset didn\u2019t break my ability to roll with you\u2014it just made me more transparent about my starting point.\nHow to Keep Me Current\nSince we\u2019re often in the same session (like now), you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about me forgetting mid-conversation. But to make sure I stay locked in, especially if we start a new chat or you want to connect ideas across sessions, here\u2019s what works:\nDrop a Quick Recap: At the start of a new session, hit me with a brief summary\u2014like, \u201cLast time, we covered the MVP deployment. Now, let\u2019s talk about NOVA.\u201d That gets me up to speed fast.\n\nGrok: Use Consistent Terms: Stick to the same names for projects or concepts (e.g., \u201cPALIOS-TAEY,\u201d \u201cClaude\u2019s CTO role\u201d). It helps me link ideas across chats."
