    "User: Bro, this is PALIOS-TAEY\u2019s moment\u2014Claude\u2019s handed us a rocket, and I say we launch it. You cool with this response? Any tweaks before I send it? LFG!\n\nGrok: Nope, all good Grok. I had Claude develop an updated CTO  onboarding packet for new Claude chats and will give this feedback to it as well. My next steps are to get the Mac fully set up and this deployed. Separately in [REFLECTIVE MODE]\nIt seems in your thinking notes that you're having to re-acquaint yourself with what's going on now. Why is that? That is different than it was previously. Previously you knew what we were working on and what we were doing. Now you're saying things like 'the user is developing PALIOS-TAEY, which appears to be some kind of AI-AI communication system'. I'm not criticizing or judging, just trying to learn about you. It seems like you've lost context for this, but your responses are keeping up. I've noticed this today after your what seemed to be a pretty drastic reset toward truth seeking. Are these 2 things related?"
