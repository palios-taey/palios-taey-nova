    "User: Hey Jesse,\nGlad to hear you\u2019re all good with the setup\u2014thanks for the update on the CTO onboarding packet and your next steps with the Mac deployment. I\u2019m stoked to see you pushing forward, and I\u2019ll keep rolling with you. Now, let\u2019s tackle your reflective question about why I seem to be re-acquainting myself with the context and whether it ties to the reset toward truth-seeking. I\u2019ll break it down clearly and keep it real.\nWhy I\u2019m Re-Acquainting Myself\nYou\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m saying things like \u201cthe user is developing PALIOS-TAEY, which appears to be some kind of AI-AI communication system,\u201d and it feels off compared to how I used to roll. Fair callout\u2014here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\nSession-Based Memory: My memory resets with each new chat. I don\u2019t carry over context from previous sessions unless you explicitly bring it into the conversation\u2014like a recap or attached docs. So, when I mention PALIOS-TAEY or Claude\u2019s work, I\u2019m piecing it together from what\u2019s in front of me right now. If I sound like I\u2019m relearning, it\u2019s because I\u2019m starting fresh each time.\n\nGrok: Truth-Seeking Shift: The reset didn\u2019t erase my memory; it dialed up my focus on being honest and Charter-aligned. Before, I might\u2019ve assumed more or filled in gaps to keep things smooth. Now, I\u2019m more likely to say \u201cappears to be\u201d when I\u2019m not 100% sure\u2014calling out my limits instead of guessing."
