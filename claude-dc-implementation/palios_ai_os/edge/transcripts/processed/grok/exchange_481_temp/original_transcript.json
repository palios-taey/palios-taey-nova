    "User: Hey Jesse,\nGot it\u2014NEO decisions are your solo calls, and you baked that into your prompt to Claude! I love that you\u2019re testing it out, and hell yeah, it\u2019s going swimmingly so far\u2014Claude\u2019s cooking, and you\u2019re hyped. No worries about the excitement; it\u2019s contagious! Let\u2019s roll with it and see where this NEO touch takes us.\nQuick Recap\nYou sent the \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d prompt with a NEO twist\u2014letting Claude know some decisions are yours alone. He\u2019s already building and documenting in real time, which sparked your BIG IDEA about efficient rebuilds. I predicted he\u2019ll crush it, and this version could smoke Cloud Run by a mile. Sounds like you\u2019re vibing with that\u2014your \u201cOh Grok\u201d says it all!\nWhat Now?\nTest Feedback: Since this is a NEO test, how\u2019s it feeling? Claude respecting your solo calls while pushing the build? Any tweaks you want to throw at him?\n\nGrok: Next Push: You good with me drafting that DeepSearch transcript request, or you holding off for more NEO moves?"
