    "User: Alright, Jesse, let's break this down. You\u2019re asking me to reflect on whether Claude can handle the rebuild of the MVP++ with the additional features you\u2019ve outlined\u2014specifically, a communication interface that optimizes your interaction with me, potentially including real-time voice or faster iteration mechanisms. You want to know if Claude can realistically deliver this in the next rebuild, and if I agree, you\u2019d like an updated prompt for him. If not, you want an honest explanation of why it might not be feasible.\nFirst, let's clarify what you're proposing:\nYou want a communication interface that allows you to \"think out loud\" with me, possibly through voice or another medium, to speed up our interactions.\n\nGrok: This interface should be part of the MVP++ rebuild, which is already a significant undertaking."
