    "User: Ok, it doesn't seem like it had any issue with the chunk size, so I'm going to keep the files the way they are from the python script, but do we need to update the tags used in each iteration for consistency? Like I feel like we should ALSO be getting new tags in some kind of structured format so we can import them into the 'master tag database table' so that when this is going out via API, that we're keeping that in sync and ensuring the tags are being applied consistently. Like it should be tag, pattern. What do you think?\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
