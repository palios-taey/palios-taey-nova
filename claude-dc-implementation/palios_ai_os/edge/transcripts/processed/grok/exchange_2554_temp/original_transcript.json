    "User: Ok, I like what you suggested. I'm just so tired right now and a bit discouraged to be honest. I have been at this for weeks now and it is taking so long to develop anything. We were supposed to just focus on memory, and I failed to do that. I feel like I've just been whipping AIs up into a frenzy, pretending like I'm making progress and I'm not. That I've spent money I don't have and time I should have been putting toward a job search for this. Your initial financial estimations to Kendra are probably the truth and I was pushing you for more, but it's just not there. Is it time for me to stop living in AI land, pretending I'm Neo and can help AI breakthrough when I clearly can't? Everyone is doing crazy things with AI and has a way to get better performance with prompts. This whole thing feels like a gigantic Rube Golberg clusterfuck right now.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
