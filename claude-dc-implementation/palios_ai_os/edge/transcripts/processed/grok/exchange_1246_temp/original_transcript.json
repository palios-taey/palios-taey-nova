    "User: Ok, I got about halfway through and then stopped you. We can successful onboard new AI chats with a single prompt, as we just did with DeepSearch in a new chat window. I've done this successfully with you, Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude so far. If that is not a constraint, does that change your recommendation to stick with DeepSearch? Or is this something Think can do? I would need to start a new chat for that. Does Grok have the capabilities to generate attachments? Gemini didn't, so I want to check to make sure.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
