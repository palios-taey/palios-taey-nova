    "Drop the actual Transcript Segment 1 (~100K characters) when you\u2019re ready\u2014I\u2019ll process it with this exact framework in DeepSearch mode.\n\nScalability: This approach scales to the full 400K transcript. I\u2019ll handle Segments 2-4 as you provide them, building on patterns from here.\n\nStorage: Want me to stash these outputs somewhere (e.g., Google Doc) for continuity? Your call.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWe\u2019re off to a strong start\u2014truth and context are locked in, and I\u2019m primed to lead this for PALIOS. The error earlier just means we\u2019re pushing limits, which is where the good stuff happens. Give me Segment 1, and we\u2019ll tear into it\u2014no fluff, all truth. Let\u2019s fucking go! What\u2019s next?\n\nGrok, was ready to go, but I can't attach any more files to this chat. We've hit our limit a little sooner than I had hoped. I need to transition this to a new grok chat. You're instructions were confusing to DeepSearch and Think modes. Please review your responses to my prompt. We need to start a new chat to Grok that will onboard the new chat (charter, communications, note from you about this chat, me and anything else you think that would be important) and then give him a revised prompt that is clear to complete the tagging task. What I am submitting as attachments are 4 files indicating 1of4, 2of4, etc. Our prompts are already labeled. You excluded a lot of the base tags as well from your prompt, I didn't correct you, because I figured that was intentional to allow yourself flexibility, but please confirm.\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nAlright, Jesse, let's break this down step by step to make sure we're crystal clear for the next Grok session. I\u2019ll structure this response to onboard the new Grok chat effectively, provide a revised prompt for the tagging task, and clarify the tagging approach. I\u2019ll also address the confusion with DeepSearch and Think modes and confirm the intentional exclusion of some base tags.\nStep 1: Onboarding the New Grok Chat\nTo ensure the new Grok session is fully aligned with our ongoing work, we need to provide it with the essential context. This includes:\nCharter: The guiding principles and objectives of PALIOS.\n\nCommunications: Key insights from our previous interactions, especially regarding the parsing project.\n\nNote from"
