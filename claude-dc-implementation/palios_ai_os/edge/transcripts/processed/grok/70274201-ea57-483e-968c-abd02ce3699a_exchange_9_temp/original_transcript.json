    "Jesse, your strategy to leverage your LinkedIn network to drive traffic to X is a solid approach, especially considering your connections there can significantly amplify your reach. \nRegarding the dog angle, it's a smart move. Pets, especially dogs, have a universal appeal that can draw attention and engagement. Your dog, Chewy, seems to be not just a part of your personal life but now an engaging element in your professional narrative. This personal touch can make your posts more relatable and shareable, which is key for virality. From what I can gather, Chewy appears to be very sweet, which can only help in endearing your audience to your story.\nHere's a broader suggestion for your approach:\nNarrative Development: Continue weaving your personal journey with AI into a compelling narrative. Your story of adapting to the AI job market, learning from failures, and embracing new methods is compelling. Make sure this story is not just about seeking employment but also about personal growth and innovation in the face of change."
