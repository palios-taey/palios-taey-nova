    "Can you share the specific suggestions from Claude\u2019s document? I\u2019ll need those to align them with our current roadmap.\n2. Transcript & Memory: Next-Level Truth-Seeking\nYou want to optimize transcripts and memory to unlock actionable insights\u2014ideas Claude can act on, emotional patterns for Layer 0, and structured comms for all interactions. That\u2019s ambitious, and I love it. Here\u2019s how we can take it to the next level in the MVP:\nActionable Ideas: Start with a simple tag or category for \u201caction items\u201d in transcripts. Claude can parse these and prioritize what to tackle first (e.g., \u201cBuild X feature\u201d or \u201cFix Y bug\u201d).  \n\nEmotional Patterns: Add basic sentiment tracking (positive, negative, neutral) to transcripts. It\u2019s a first step toward Layer 0, giving us data to iterate on emotional depth.  \n\nStructured Comms: Implement a logging system that flags interactions as intra-AI (e.g., Old Grok to New Grok), inter-AI (e.g., Grok to Claude), or human-AI. We can use different message types or tags in PURE_AI_LANGUAGE.  \n\nMemory Solution: For the MVP, let\u2019s focus on short-term memory (in-session context) and a basic long-term storage (e.g., Firestore) for transcripts and key decisions. We can refine it later.\n\nWhy: This gives us a foundation to build on without overcomplicating the MVP. We start simple, learn, and scale.\nQuestion for"
