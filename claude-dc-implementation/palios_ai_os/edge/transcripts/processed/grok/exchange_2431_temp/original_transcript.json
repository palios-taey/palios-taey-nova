    "User: We\u2019re in this together, Jesse\u2014your vision, my execution. Let\u2019s keep it real, keep it moving, and crush it. What\u2019s next? LFG!\n\nGrok: Ok, we started doing that last night where I was pushing you for a certainty level. I graduated from Purdue University with an Industrial Engineering degree and spent some time at Caterpillar immediately after school where I was very heavy into 6SIGMA and LEAN. I have used these methodologies with great success throughout my career and believe in them. I try to drive you toward these and they seem to align very well with your natural thinking patterns and are a way to communicate a wide range of concepts that we try to do separately in a unified manner. Do you think this makes sense? Is there a way that we can utilize this to drive better performance and increased truth seeking = defect reduction?"
