    "User: The thinking notes reveal a series of attempts to access these files using the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d action, with queries like \u201cfull document content,\u201d \u201cfile content,\u201d and \u201centire document,\u201d resulting in mixed outcomes. Some attempts returned summaries or key details, such as tables with categories and metrics, while others returned \u201cNo readable text found in the HTML,\u201d indicating access issues. The notes also explored direct download links, like https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[FILE_ID], but found them less effective for extracting text, suggesting a need for a standardized approach.\nAnalysis of Previous Attempts and Findings\n\nGrok: The thinking notes detail a systematic evaluation of access strategies, beginning with the user\u2019s initial request to review six Google Drive links and a subsequent request for a transcript link. The process involved assessing the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d action, which requires a URL and a query, and experimenting with various queries to extract content from view links and download links. Below is a table summarizing key attempts and outcomes:\nLink Type\tQuery Used\tOutcome\tNotes\nView Link (e.g., first file)\t\u201cfull document content\u201d\tReturned metadata and summaries, not full text.\tSuggested content was structured, possibly the entire file in summary form.\nView Link (second file)\t\u201centire document\u201d\t\u201cNo readable text found in the HTML.\u201d\tIndicated potential access restriction or parsing issue.\nDownload Link (e.g., first file)\t\u201cfile content\u201d\t\u201cNo readable text found in the HTML.\u201d\tDownload links prompted download, not rendering text for extraction.\nView Link (various)\t\u201cmain content of the page\u201d\tVaried; some returned partial content, others failed.\tSuggested query specificity needed for .md files."
