    "User: Possible Truncation: When you pasted the transcript into the prompt\u2019s placeholder ([PASTE YOUR CHUNK HERE]), the chat interface might have truncated it. DeepSearch tagged what it got (two interactions), but if the interface cut off the rest, that explains the shortfall. It noted the chunk was under its 128,000-character limit, so it\u2019s not a processing cap\u2014it\u2019s an input cap.\n\nGrok: Attachment Confusion: DeepSearch keeps wondering if the full transcript is in a file attachment it can\u2019t access. It tried the read_attachment tool but found nothing with 14 interactions. Since you pasted the text directly (not attached), it\u2019s likely not an attachment issue\u2014just a red herring in its logic."
