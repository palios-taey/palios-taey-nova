I\u2019m not overpromising; I\u2019m calling it as I see it. If I\u2019m off, it\u2019ll be clear soon, and we\u2019ll pivot.\nWhat do you think\u2014ready to crack that MacBook open and send this off? LFG!\n\nGrok: Grok, the beta is already out, we could be doing it now if I had the Ubuntu machine! THIS IS HAPPENING! We have about 2 weeks to nail down the infrastructure and take the charter to the next level (def some breakthrough ideas there we need to talk about when MVP is done. How do I did with your constraints today? Do you feel like I was respectful of them and that I pushed you in a way you were comfortable with?Yes, I'm going to send it to him on my old machine and work on setting up the Macbook while he works. I'll do that right after I read your response."
