    "User: With that in mind, here's a draft of the updated prompt:\n\"Claude, as we prepare for the MVP++ rebuild using the NOVA methodology, Jesse has proposed an additional feature that could significantly enhance our communication and iteration speed. The idea is to develop a communication interface that allows Jesse to 'think out loud' with Grok, potentially through voice or another medium, to facilitate faster and more natural interactions.\nWhile this feature aligns with our goal of optimizing AI-human collaboration, I want to ensure that we approach it realistically given the scope of the rebuild. Developing a full-fledged communication interface, especially one involving voice, would require substantial technical work and could potentially delay the overall project.\nHowever, I believe a compromise is possible. We could aim to include a basic version of the communication interface in the MVP++ rebuild, such as a streamlined text-based system that allows for quicker iteration. This would provide immediate value while allowing us to refine and expand the feature in future iterations.\nPlease assess the feasibility of incorporating a simplified communication interface into the MVP++ rebuild. Consider the following:\nWhat would a basic version of this interface look like?\n\nGrok: How much additional time and resources would it require?"
