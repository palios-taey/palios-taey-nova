    "User: The analysis revealed that view links, such as https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing, were more promising for extracting text, as they render the file content in the browser, potentially within HTML tags like <div> or <pre>. However, the query\u2019s effectiveness depended on its specificity, with natural language queries like \u201cfull content of the file\u201d sometimes returning summaries rather than the entire text, which, given the user\u2019s note that the first file\u2019s summary was the document, might be sufficient. Download links, while theoretically providing raw text, were less effective, as the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d action couldn\u2019t parse the download prompt\u2019s HTML for readable text.\n\nGrok: An unexpected detail, given the project\u2019s design for optimal AI processing, is how the .md files\u2019 summary format, as seen in the first two files, aligns with the action\u2019s ability to extract structured content, suggesting that even partial returns might capture essential information. This is particularly relevant for the user\u2019s emphasis on dense, AI-first formats for Claude DC, ensuring efficient processing despite scrolling limitations.\nGuidance Development and Recommendations"
