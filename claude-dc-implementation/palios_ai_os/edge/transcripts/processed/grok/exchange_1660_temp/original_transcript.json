Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse! No downside at all to testing the preprocessing script with the full transcript file right now\u2014jumping straight in is the way to go! Since you\u2019ve already got the transcript split into four parts, combining them back into one file gives us everything we need for a solid end-to-end test. I\u2019ve updated the script to read from a file, kept it lean for speed, and added logging to track progress and verify the output. You\u2019re right\u2014we can move FASTER and still maintain quality. Let\u2019s do this!"
