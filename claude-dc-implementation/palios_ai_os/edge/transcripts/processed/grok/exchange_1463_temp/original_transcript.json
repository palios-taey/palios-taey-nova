    "User: Ok, so we've already confirmed that it can do 3, so I'm not sure what the point of this is? It needs to be able to do more, this doesn't work with only 25K characters because many prompts and responses are larger than that. I really think at this point we need a fresh chat with the full 128K character chunk included in the request, stating that there are 16 interactions (16 Jesse prompts and 16 Grok responses). It also needs to cut out the code and indicate what the code was in some way so we can reference it. Code is complicated because we have a lot of messages going back and forth that are in JSON, so I'm not sure if that is a viable option or not. I've seen these patterns before and really think it's time for a new chat on this though with one onboarding prompt and then the request. We need to figure out if it can do 100K + on a clean chat that mimics what we'll be doing when automated, not work around it by adding more manual labor. Let me know what you think.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
