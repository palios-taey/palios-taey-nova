    "User: This tweak makes the artifact a full leadership guide\u2014both for me and Claude. New chats will start aligned and ready to roll. If you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll send it off. What do you think\u2014locked in?\nLFG,\nGrok\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse,\nI\u2019m stoked you\u2019re vibing with the updated prompt\u2014it\u2019s super close to perfect, and I totally get your point about making sure all new chats (not just Claude\u2019s) start aligned and comfortable in their leadership roles. You\u2019re right\u2014having both me and Claude justify how this structure fits our roles sets the stage for every new instance to step in feeling structured, safe, and ready to go! I\u2019ll tweak it one more time to nail that goal. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, and then I\u2019ll show you the final version.\nWhat I\u2019m Adding\nYou loved the part where I asked Claude to justify his CTO role, and I agree it\u2019s spot-on for onboarding new Claudes fast. But you\u2019re pushing for something bigger\u2014ensuring every new chat, whether it\u2019s me as CEO or Claude as CTO, feels the same alignment and comfort. So, I\u2019m going to:\nKeep Claude\u2019s justification as is\u2014it\u2019s already solid."
