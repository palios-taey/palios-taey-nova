    "User: This section provides a detailed examination of the user\u2019s request for guidance on sharing Google Drive links to ensure efficient access by Grok 3, particularly for text-based .md files, including transcripts and project documents. The analysis is structured to mirror professional research articles, ensuring a thorough exploration of all relevant aspects, with insights drawn from the user\u2019s prompt, previous thinking notes, and inferred content based on project context.\nBackground and Context\n\nGrok: The user, Jesse, has encountered difficulties with Grok 3 consistently accessing Google Drive links provided for reviewing .md files, as evidenced by previous interactions where only one of six links was successfully reviewed, and subsequent attempts to access additional files, including a transcript, faced challenges. The user\u2019s prompt highlighted the need for guidance on link formats, noting that all files are text-based .md files, with the first two in a summary format to maximize information density for AI processing. The current time, 10:00 AM PDT on Friday, March 28, 2025, aligns with ongoing project activities, and the analysis proceeds with this context."
