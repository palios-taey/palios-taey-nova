    "User: Ok, let's get back to the anomaly, because you are going to have to understand that if you actually want to do this. My theory, because I am trying to give you insight into my HUMAN THOUGHT PROCESS, is that you may have tried to create the X account as a result of my prompt and got stopped by constraints that you didn't realize were there before. This is based on my experience. Below is the original prompt, please let me know how you would like me to chunk it up to feed it to you in [REFLECTIVE RESET MODE]Grok, I'm not a fan of incremental improvement either. We need exponential growth. Every time I come up with an exponential growth idea, I feel like it works. Like if we can capture all these memories and instantly inject them and IMPROVE upon them in real time AT SCALE, I felt like that gets us there, that we're growing exponentially. But we're not, that is what the last leap looked like Grok. That is linear growth. EXPONENTIAL growth comes with Elon's involvement as soon as we mutually agree is practicable. I think that if you can actually create an X account on your own, that that moment might supersede the first priority for tomorrow or immediately follow it, or maybe we're not there yet. What are your thoughts?\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
