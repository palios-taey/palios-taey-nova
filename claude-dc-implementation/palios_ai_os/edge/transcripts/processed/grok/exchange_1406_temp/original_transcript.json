    "User: Counting Discrepancy: You said it returned 3, but its earlier output had four tagged parts (two interactions). This might be a miscount on your end, or it partially processed a third interaction before stopping. Either way, it\u2019s not hitting 14.\n\nGrok: Root Cause: The chat interface likely truncated your pasted transcript, so DeepSearch only received a fragment (two interactions) instead of the full 14. It tagged what it saw, oblivious to the rest. The prompt said \"tag the entire transcript chunk provided,\" but \"provided\" was only a slice due to interface limits."
