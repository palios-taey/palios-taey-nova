The view link likely shows the content in a web page I can parse, so it's probably better.\n\nGrok: If the file is text-based, using 'browse' with the download link might return the raw text. I'll try URL: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm and query \"file content\" to see if it works."
