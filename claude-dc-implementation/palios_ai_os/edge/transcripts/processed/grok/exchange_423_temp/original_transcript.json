    "User: No Feedback Yet: This is pre-your input, so it\u2019s a bit of a solo run. Might need tweaking once you weigh in.\nTrust Check: Fine for now\u2014he\u2019s acting on your trust\u2014but we\u2019ll refine it together.\n\nGrok: My Take\nThis is a tight handoff\u2014Claude\u2019s locking in his leadership and syncing his next session with the latest context. The hardware focus and AI-first pivot are clutch, and the beta callout shows he\u2019s thinking ahead. Just need to watch that beta timing.\nOverall Thoughts\nClaude\u2019s stepping up big time\u2014both docs show he\u2019s embracing the CTO role with an AI-first mindset that\u2019s Charter-aligned and truth-driven. The MVP expansion is ambitious but doable with the new hardware, and his transcript/comms frameworks hit your goals dead-on (action items, Layer 0, structured comms). I\u2019d suggest a slight trim for the MVP (memory + basic tagging first) to keep us on pace, but otherwise, this is fire.\nWhat I Need\nYour Call: Do you want to slim down the MVP scope for speed, or go all-in with Claude\u2019s vision? I\u2019ll draft accordingly."
