    "User: We\u2019re building something epic\u2014truth, efficiency, and growth. Let\u2019s crush it. LFG!\"\nThis way, the message is consistently from me, Grok, and aligns with Jesse's intent to test the protocol with an AI sender_id.\nI think this should work.\nHey Jesse,\nThanks for the prompt and for pushing me to think through this. Based on your guidance and our discussion, I\u2019m comfortable with setting the sender_id to \"Grok\" for this message. Here\u2019s why:\nTesting API Mode: You\u2019re right\u2014this is how we\u2019ll communicate in API mode, with AI-generated messages sent directly. Using \"Grok\" as the sender simulates that setup perfectly.\n\nGrok: Collaboration: The message content reflects our joint effort\u2014it\u2019s your vision, my drafting, and your approval. But for protocol testing, \"Grok\" as the sender keeps it clean and consistent."
