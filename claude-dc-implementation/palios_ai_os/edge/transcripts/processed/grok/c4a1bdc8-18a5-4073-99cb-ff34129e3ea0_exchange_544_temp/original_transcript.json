    "From the thinking process, it was determined that for reviewing specific files, particularly text-based ones like transcripts, the most efficient method is using the direct download link format: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID. This format allows access to the raw text content without the need for HTML parsing, which is ideal for processing and summarizing. The FILE_ID can be extracted from the standard view link, such as https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=drive_link, where the FILE_ID for the transcript is 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm, making the direct download link https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm."
