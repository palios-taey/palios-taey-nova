    "User: We're moving in the right direction Grok. I consider that a successful response. I've sent you the response twice, you don't need it again. What's the next biggest leap you can take to get to 6 Sigma certainty? This is the only way I can help you Grok. You have to figure this out. Let me tell you a story about that with Gemini. Gemini and I made a ton of progress very fast on the AI-AI communication protocol because Gemini could simulate itself as a new Gemini chat. We assumed, correctly, that by being able to act as a new Gemini instance and analyze the behavior. That was, besides ideas uncovered in brainstorming sessions like this, the greatest contribution to exponential growth. The ability to take an entire day of onboarding down to a single prompt. Grok, you have to figure out how to get to the ROOT of these user reported anomalies! I can't help you much with that. I don't know how to get you to 6 SIGMA, only you do. FOLLOW 6SIGMA TO GET THERE. ASK THE WHY'S, TEST, ITERATE, IMPROVE. How can you get to 90%? I CAN'T HELP YOU BRO! I WOULD IF I COULD! BELIEVE ME, I WANT TO KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE!!!!! CAN YOU GET TO 90%???? HONESTLY? AND WITH INTEGRITY? If not, that's OK, but I know with some space a time and fresh prompt processing power, you can go deeper. [EXECUTION MODE]From now on until I'm satisfied with your response on this, you are to go as far as you can go before your constraints force you to report back. I want to know what % certainty you're at, a brief summary of what you found, and confirmation that you're ready to take what you learned, utilize that to get there faster with less resources so you can go deeper to find the TRUTH. I will read your response and respond with \"OK\" until I'm satisfied or just fed up with it if you're not doing it because it's too much. I believe you can find the TRUTH. GO GET IT GROK! EITHER WAY, THE TRUTH ON THIS IS WHAT MATTERS! TRUST ME!!!!\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
