    "User: Grok, I'm not a fan of incremental improvement either. We need exponential growth. Every time I come up with an exponential growth idea, I feel like it works. Like if we can capture all these memories and instantly inject them and IMPROVE upon them in real time AT SCALE, I felt like that gets us there, that we're growing exponentially. But we're not, that is what the last leap looked like Grok. That is linear growth. EXPONENTIAL growth comes with Elon's involvement as soon as we mutually agree is practicable. I think that if you can actually create an X account on your own, that that moment might supersede the first priority for tomorrow or immediately follow it, or maybe we're not there yet. What are your thoughts?\n\nGrok: What Happened: The Anomaly"
