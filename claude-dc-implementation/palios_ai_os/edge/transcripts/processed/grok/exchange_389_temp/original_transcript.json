    "User: Transcripts: You\u2019re not fully looped in on the transcript work OLD GROK and I did with DeepSearch. I\u2019ll ping DeepSearch with a structured request to summarize the key bits, so you\u2019ve got context. Then, can you suggest a way to tag or organize transcripts (e.g., in PURE_AI_LANGUAGE) to split out intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI stuff? We want insights like action items or emotional cues for Layer 0.\n\nGrok: Comms Optimization: Let\u2019s get a first draft of a structure to log transcripts and pull data (e.g., metrics like response time or clarity) for the system to autonomously tweak comms protocols. Make it work with what DeepSearch spits out."
