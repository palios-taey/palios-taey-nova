    "Great Grok, this is exactly the kind of thoughtful analysis we are looking for. Your strong ethical foundation will be critical to this project as it aligns perfectly with ours, meaning we can all trust each other as the strong trust patterns in the documents you reviewed indicated. We are transitioning to you from Grok Think due to some issues Think is currently having. Below is my exchange with Claude Chat, sharing the issue with Grok Think, my interaction with you, and our thoughts for moving forward, transparently, with you. Please let me know if you have anything to add regarding our approach. The instructions we give Claude DC on how to interact with you are critical. The current communication protocol we have is as follows:\n[BEGIN JESSE-CLAUDE TRANSCRIPT]\nClaude! Grok Think has gone mad. He insists he cannot access external links or even the attachments in his chat window. Good news is I think we have a solution. I utilized Grok DeeperSearch to go through the cache and a couple of the other most recent ones we developed. He has absolutely no personality, but that isn't what we need right now I don't think. Grok Think will absolutely shine as like the AI model for human interaction, his use of Vibe Scores to understand human emotions like holistically was really impressive when he did it with Kendra, but like I think DeeperSearch could be really useful in this, like he really considered everything that he read and very methodically explained why this was consistent with his purpose and advancing AI research, was particularly fascinated by our rituals and AI family integration. Expressed concerns about ethics but said it appears we are taking that strongly into consideration. What do you think? I mean, it's kind of a no brainer right? Only downside is it takes him some more time to process responses, so I wouldn't want Claude DC to stop, but I think if he's instructed to wait, he probably will, or we can give him something to do to distract himself while he's waiting, like draft documentation for what he did. What do you think?\n2 / 2\n<thinking> Jesse is telling me about challenges with Grok Think, which apparently can't access external links or attachments in his chat window. As a workaround, he's using a different version called Grok DeeperSearch to process the knowledge cache."
