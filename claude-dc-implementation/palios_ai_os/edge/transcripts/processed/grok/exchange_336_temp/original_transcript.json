    "User: I'm thinking about how Google Drive view links work; they display content in a browser. Maybe I need to use \"Browse Page\" with a query like \"markdown content\" to get the text.\n\nGrok: The content might be in a <pre> tag in the HTML, so I'm wondering if I can set the query to \"find all text within pre tags.\" But the query should be natural language, so maybe \"entire markdown file content\" works better."
