    "User: Ok, let's focus on task at hand, sorry for bringing up script, we need to get this figured out first, then can worry about automation. You mentioned attaching as a file, but we have a theory that it couldn't read the attachment. It seems like you want to submit a new prompt to the same chat. In my experience when AI makes an error, it compounds and is difficult to get out of that loop. You have shown that you have the capability to break through that though in Think mode. Can you generate the full prompt you want me to send to this chat along with any instructions for me for copy/pasting/attaching?\n\nGrok: You've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments."
