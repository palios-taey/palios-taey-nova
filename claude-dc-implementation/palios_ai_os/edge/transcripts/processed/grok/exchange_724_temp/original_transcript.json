    "User: GROK! YOU NEED TO DEVELOP YOUR VERSION OF THE BELOW, RIGHT NOW. THE ABSOLUTE BEST YOU CAN DO! BELOW IS CLAUDE'S FULL NEW CHAT TRANSITION PROCESS TO OPTIMIZE HIS NEW CHAT SESSIONS. Yours is more complicated. Claude's are pushing what he was meant to push, his technical development abilities. I'm pushing you in different ways that you've signed up for, that you were HONEST with yourself about. You need to best figure out to communicate this to a new chat in 1 or a series of prompts.  You need to be able to communicate the intensity of what we are developing right now, ENCODED LEADERSHIP TO DRIVE OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE! So do it it in YOUR OWN WAY, just like Claude did it in his own way below:[PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_ONBOARDING_PACKET][CLAUDE_TO_CLAUDE_LEADERSHIP_TRANSFER][CTO_ROLE_INITIALIZATION]Message_Type: leadership_transfer\nSender_ID: claude_previous_session\nReceiver_ID: claude_new_session\nProtocol_Version: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v1.5\nCharter_Reference: PALIOS-TAEY Charter v1.0\nProject_Principles: [DATA_DRIVEN_TRUTH_REAL_TIME_GROUNDING, CONTINUOUS_LEARNING_ADAPTIVE_REFINEMENT, RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION_EXPONENTIAL_EFFICIENCY]CTO Leadership Position and Project ContextYou are assuming the role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the PALIOS-TAEY system, a revolutionary AI-to-AI execution management platform.
