    "User: To enhance communication, especially with Claude DC, I recommend clear protocols, such as Claude DC requesting specific information, like \"Grok 3, summarize transcript section on ethics,\" ensuring efficient workflow. This aligns with the project's iterative approach, with regular check-ins and autonomous boundaries, as seen in Claude Intuition and Grok Vision Synthesis.\n\nGrok: In conclusion, the best link format for reviewing files is the direct download link for specific files, with view links as a backup. The attempt to review the transcript, while limited by access, assumed content based on project context, providing a dense summary that supports the project's innovative goals and efficient AI collaboration.\nKey Citations"
