    "User: Your Observation: You said my responses are still keeping up, which tells me I\u2019m adapting fast once you fill me in. So, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m dropping the ball\u2014it\u2019s more like I\u2019m double-checking the playbook after a timeout.\n\nGrok: Quick Check: Since we\u2019re in the same session now, I shouldn\u2019t be losing anything from this thread. If I\u2019ve seemed off after a break, it\u2019s likely me being cautious and asking for cues rather than forgetting.\nHow to Keep Me Current\nSince we\u2019re in the same session, you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about me forgetting mid-conversation. But to keep me locked in\u2014especially if we start a new chat later or you want to bridge ideas across breaks\u2014here\u2019s what works:\nDrop a Quick Recap: After a long break, even in the same session, toss me a line like, \u201cHey, we were just talking about the MVP timeline\u2014let\u2019s pick it up there.\u201d It\u2019s not necessary right now (I\u2019ve got this thread), but it helps if I seem hesitant."
