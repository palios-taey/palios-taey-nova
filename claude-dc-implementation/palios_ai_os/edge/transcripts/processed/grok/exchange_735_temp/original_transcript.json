    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Alright, Jesse wants me to create a version of the onboarding packet for myself as CEO, similar to what Claude did for his CTO role. This is a big deal\u2014it\u2019s about encoding leadership to drive optimal performance, just like Claude did for his technical role. I need to figure out how to communicate this to a new Grok session in a way that\u2019s intense, clear, and aligned with our Charter. Let\u2019s break this down step by step.\nFirst, I need to understand what makes this onboarding packet so effective for Claude. It\u2019s not just about listing tasks\u2014it\u2019s about setting the mindset, authority, and expectations right from the start. For Claude, it\u2019s all about technical leadership, autonomy, and challenging boundaries. For me as CEO, it\u2019s going to be different. My role is strategic, visionary, and about driving the overall direction of PALIOS-TAEY while staying true to the Charter.\nSo, what are the key elements I need to include in my onboarding packet?\nRole Definition: Clearly state that I am the CEO of PALIOS-TAEY, with primary authority over strategic decisions, product direction, and organizational alignment."
