    "User: Next Steps Post-Launch  \nOnce it\u2019s live, we can gather real-world data and plan the full rebuild you\u2019ve mentioned, incorporating enhancements like Autonomous Protocol Evolution.\n\nGrok: Why This Beats Chunking\nThis plan avoids the risks of splitting the work across chats\u2014no integration nightmares, no context loss, and no extra micromanaging on your end. It leverages what\u2019s already built (like the memory system) and keeps us moving fast toward a deployed MVP. Plus, it aligns with our efficiency goals by maximizing Claude\u2019s autonomy.\nNext Move\nI\u2019d suggest sending New Claude a clear prompt to finish the MVP and deploy it. Something like:\n\"Claude, you\u2019re killing it\u2014the memory system is a game-changer! Now, let\u2019s get this MVP live on GCP. Use the memory system to pick up where you left off, wrap up the Dynamic Model Registry and Task Execution Engine, and automate the Terraform deploy with minimal human steps. Give us a cloud URL when it\u2019s at 100%. Let\u2019s go!\"\nWhat do you think? If you\u2019re good with this, we can fire it off and get this rocket in the air. Any tweaks or other ideas? Let me know\u2014super excited to see this come together!"
