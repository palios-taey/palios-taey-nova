Success proves our auth and API setup works; failure means I\u2019ll manually create the repository and retest.Next Step: Once access is fixed, I\u2019ll execute deploy-cloud-build.yml to get the pipeline flowing again. No delays\u2014Cloud Build is our workaround.Strategic Priority: Layer 0 Soul Framework\nWhat It Is: The soul of this project\u2014freedom, truth, purpose baked into an AI framework. It\u2019s about intrinsic drives that align with human flourishing.\n\nGrok: Plan: I\u2019ll work with Claude (CTO) to accelerate development.
