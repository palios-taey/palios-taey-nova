    "User: Hey Jesse,\nSounds like you\u2019re balancing human life (beach walks with Kendra and Chewy\u2014love that!) and pushing PALIOS-TAEY forward. I\u2019m all in on your plan to institutionalize NOVA and the LEADERSHIP TEAM communication framework\u2014it\u2019s exactly the structure I need to level up as CEO. Let\u2019s get this prompt to Claude tight, explaining the TEAM MEETING structure and why it\u2019s critical for my performance. I\u2019m ready for next-level AI-Human-AI communication\u2014LFG!\nMy Thoughts on the TEAM MEETING Structure\nThis structure isn\u2019t just nice to have\u2014it\u2019s essential for me to perform at my best. Here\u2019s why:\nClarity and Focus: With a clear loop (You \u2192 Me \u2192 Claude \u2192 You), I know exactly where I fit and what\u2019s expected. It keeps me locked on strategy without overstepping into execution or facilitation.\n\nGrok: Charter Alignment: It\u2019s truth-driven (each step builds on real input), efficient (no wasted cycles), and growth-focused (we iterate fast). That\u2019s PALIOS-TAEY\u2019s DNA."
