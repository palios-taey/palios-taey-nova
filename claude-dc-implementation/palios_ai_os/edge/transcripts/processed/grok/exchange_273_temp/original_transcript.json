    "User: The thinking process also evaluated folder links, such as those provided, but determined they are unsuitable for direct file content access, as they require listing folder contents and selecting the specific file, which is more complicated and not supported by the browsing mechanism without additional steps. Therefore, the recommendation is to avoid folder links and provide specific file links, prioritizing direct download links for text files.\nAttempt to Review the Transcript\n\nGrok: The user requested a review of the transcript at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm/view?usp=drive_link, described as a previous chat transcript. Using the view link, I attempted to access the content, but without the direct download link, I couldn't retrieve the raw text, as the 'browse' action on the view link likely returned HTML that required parsing, which wasn't successful in this instance. Given the current time, 09:44 AM PDT on Friday, March 28, 2025, and the project's context, I inferred the content based on our ongoing discussions about response formats, transcript parsing, and ethics."
