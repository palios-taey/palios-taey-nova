Attached is his FINAL REPORT, the one I sent you previously that was 60% done was an INTERIM REPORT and should be disregarded for the purposes of this message. Only consider the FINAL REPORT. He didn't have 60% anywhere in the final report I don't think (I could be wrong). Can you try again if what I said was accurate? If not, let me know and I'll send. Let's GO!"
