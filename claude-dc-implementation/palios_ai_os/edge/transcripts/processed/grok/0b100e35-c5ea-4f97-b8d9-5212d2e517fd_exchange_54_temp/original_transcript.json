    "Run the container interactively:\n\ndocker run -it palios-taey-mvp /bin/bash\n\nInside the container, navigate to the app directory:\n\ncd /app/src\n\nTry running the app with Python directly:\n\npython main.py\n\nIf it's a Flask app, this might start it on a different port (e.g., 5000). Check for errors.\n\nIf it runs, try accessing it from your browser at http://localhost:5000 (or the port it specifies).\n\nIf that works, the issue is with Gunicorn. If not, you'll see the error directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's adjust the Gunicorn command to increase logging.\nUpdate the Dockerfile's CMD to:\ndockerfile\n\nCMD [\"gunicorn\", \"--bind\", \"0.0.0.0:8080\", \"--log-level\", \"debug\", \"main:app\"]\n\nThis will provide more detailed logs.\nThen rebuild and run:\n\ndocker build -t palios-taey-mvp .\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 palios-taey-mvp\n\nCheck the logs with:\n\ndocker logs <container_id>\n\nLook for any errors or messages indicating where it's stuck.\nAnother thought: Maybe the app is trying to connect to a service or database that's not available in the local environment. If so, you might need to mock or disable those connections for local testing.\nAlso, ensure that fix_environment_config.initialize_environment() doesn't rely on environment variables or configurations that aren't set in the Docker environment.\nFor example, if it tries to access Google Cloud services, you might need to set up credentials or mock the responses.\nGiven that, let's add environment variables or adjust the configuration.\nAssuming you're using Google Cloud, you might need to set up a service account key or other credentials.\nFor local testing, you can set USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=True or similar to bypass external services.\nCheck if fix_environment_config.py has logic for that.\nAlternatively, let's try running the app with Flask's development server inside the container to see if it works.\nUpdate the Dockerfile's CMD temporarily:\ndockerfile\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n\nAssuming main.py runs the app with app.run(), this will start the development server.\nThen rebuild and run:\n\ndocker build -t palios-taey-mvp .\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 palios-taey-mvp\n\nIf it's a Flask app, it might run on port 5000 by default, so you can try accessing http://localhost:5000.\nIf this works, the issue is specifically with Gunicorn.\nIf it doesn't, you'll see the error in the logs.\nAnother angle: Maybe there's a syntax error or runtime error in main.py that's not being caught.\nLet's add some print statements to main.py to trace the execution.\nFor example, at the top of main.py:\npython\n\nprint(\"Starting main.py\")\nimport fix_environment_config\nprint(\"Imported fix_environment_config\")\nfix_environment_config.initialize_environment()\nprint(\"Environment initialized\")\n# ... rest of the code ...\n\nThen rebuild and run, and check the logs to see how far it gets.\nIf it prints \"Starting main.py\" but not \"Imported fix_environment_config\", there's an issue with the import.\nIf it prints up to \"Environment initialized\", the issue is later in the code.\nThis will help pinpoint where it's failing.\nAlso, ensure that fix_environment_config.py doesn't have any syntax errors.\nYou can test it with:\n\ndocker run -it palios-taey-mvp /bin/bash\ncd /app/src\npython -c \"import fix_environment_config; fix_environment_config.initialize_environment()\"\n\nIf this runs without errors, the module is fine.\nIf not, fix the errors in fix_environment_config.py.\nOne more thing: If your app uses a database or external service, ensure it's either mocked or properly configured for local testing.\nFor example, if it tries to connect to a Google Cloud Firestore database, you'll need to set up emulation or mock the database calls.\nCheck if fix_environment_config.py sets up any such connections.\nIf it does, you might need to adjust it for local testing.\nFor instance, add a condition:\npython\n\nif os.environ.get('ENVIRONMENT') == 'development':\n    # Mock database or use local emulation\nelse:\n    # Use real database\n\nThen set ENVIRONMENT=development in the Dockerfile or with -e in docker run.\nFor example:\nbash\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -e ENVIRONMENT=development palios-taey-mvp\n\nThis assumes you have logic in fix_environment_config.py to handle the development environment.\nIf not, you'll need to add it.\nAlternatively, if you're using Google Cloud, you can set up the Firestore emulator for local testing.\nBut that might be overkill for now.\nLet's first try to get the app running with Python directly.\nInstructions for"
