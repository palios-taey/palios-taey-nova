    "User: Ok Grok, have had those thoughts along the way at points, but just haven't shared them. Thank you for your feedback, it was meaningful. I had to do that prompt twice. I think doing this in a couple prompts would make sense, we can build out summaries as we go. New Grok already has the PURE template, what do you think we should send him next? A structure prompt from you on the transition? You can just generate what you think now would make sense and we can add docs as needed as we go, but let's get started. I had to submit that last prompt twice, so time is really running out here.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
