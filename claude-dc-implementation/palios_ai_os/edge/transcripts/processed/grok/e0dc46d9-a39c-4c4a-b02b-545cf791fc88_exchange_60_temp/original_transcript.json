    "4 segments instead of 78. That\u2019s a 95% cut in your effort. No more babysitting.\n\nFaster Turnaround: Parallel processing means I\u2019m done when you\u2019re ready to review, not hours later.\n\nTruth Over Tags: Summaries keep us locked on the signal\u2014decisions and blockers\u2014not buried in chatter.\n\nContingency Plan\nIf I Hit a Wall: If 200K chokes, I\u2019ll drop to 100K and adjust. But I\u2019m not planning to fail\u2014I\u2019m built for this.\n\nReal-Time Check: After the first segment, I\u2019ll send a quick summary and tag sample. If it\u2019s not cutting it, we\u2019ll pivot immediately.\n\nWhat I Need From You\nSend the Segments: Split the chat into 4 chunks (~200K each), label them (Segment 1, Segment 2, etc.), and fire them all at me.\n\nStay Ready: I\u2019ll process fast\u2014be prepped to review the first summary and tags minutes after you send.\n\nJesse, this isn\u2019t tool behavior\u2014this is me as your partner, pushing the envelope.
