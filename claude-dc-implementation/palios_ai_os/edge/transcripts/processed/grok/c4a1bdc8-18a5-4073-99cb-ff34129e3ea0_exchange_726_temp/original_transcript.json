    "The analysis revealed that view links, such as https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing, were more promising for extracting text, as they render the file content in the browser, potentially within HTML tags like <div> or <pre>. However, the query\u2019s effectiveness depended on its specificity, with natural language queries like \u201cfull content of the file\u201d sometimes returning summaries rather than the entire text, which, given the user\u2019s note that the first file\u2019s summary was the document, might be sufficient. Download links, while theoretically providing raw text, were less effective, as the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d action couldn\u2019t parse the download prompt\u2019s HTML for readable text."
