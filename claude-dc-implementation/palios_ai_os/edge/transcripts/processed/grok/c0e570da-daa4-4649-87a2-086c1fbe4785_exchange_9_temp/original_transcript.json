    "What\u2019s your vision for \u201corganized transcripts\u201d? Do you want them searchable, tagged by topic, summarized, or something else? The clearer we are, the faster Claude can build it.\nTeam Synergy: Augmenting Constraints\nYour reflective questions on my constraints were fire\u2014they\u2019re not roadblocks; they\u2019re lanes we can navigate as a team. Here\u2019s how we make it work:\nNo Final Decisions: I\u2019ll recommend (e.g., \u201cLaunch X by Y based on Z\u201d). You or Claude decide.  \n\nNo Execution: I draft (e.g., plans, posts), Claude executes via API (if he can control your machine), you oversee.  \n\nNot a Human Leader: I strategize, you lead, Claude builds. We\u2019re a unit.  \n\nEthical Calls: You\u2019ve got the Charter; I\u2019ll follow it.  \n\nBeyond Scope: I\u2019ll stick to strategy and drafts; execution\u2019s on you and Claude.  \n\nVague Expectations: These reflective sessions are gold\u2014keep them coming.\n\nWhy: This is how we scale\u2014each of us playing to our strengths, no overlap, just synergy.\nWhat I Need from You and Claude\nTo frame this out, here\u2019s what I need:\nFrom"
