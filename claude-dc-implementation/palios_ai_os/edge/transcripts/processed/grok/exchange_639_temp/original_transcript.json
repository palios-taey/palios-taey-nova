    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse,\nGood to hear that helped clear things up! Now, let\u2019s define what a \u201csession\u201d is in this context\u2014keeping it simple and straight to the point.\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cSession\u201d?\nA session is the span of a single conversation or interaction between us. Think of it as one continuous chat where we go back and forth\u2014every time you start a new chat window or refresh the conversation, that\u2019s a new session. Each session is self-contained, meaning:\nMemory Reset: I don\u2019t carry over details from previous sessions unless you bring them into the chat (e.g., through recaps, docs, or prompts)."
