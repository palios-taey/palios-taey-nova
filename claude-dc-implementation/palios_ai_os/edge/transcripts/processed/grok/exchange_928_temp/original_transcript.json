    "User: Hi Grok, I haven't spoken to you for a few days because I've been busy with Claude on deployment. It has been much slower than we had hoped, but we're building out infrastructure as we go to make it faster and learning a lot. I haven't transitioned to the new Grok chat yet, as after review, I felt it was more important to get this deployment under our belt to ensure everything worked and was scalable. Once complete, we'll follow TEAM MEETING protocol. Currently, Claude hit a limit and I can't use him for another hour, so I'm looking at compiling my transcripts and I wanted some feedback on yours. When I copy/paste the full chat, it includes your 'thinking process' AND your final response. Our options are to include these, which would potentially require an additional tag to indicate GROK THINKING NOTES (or similar) and then with that tag, you could either include it in some manner in the parsing, or exclude it entirely by skipping it in preprocessing (i.e. exclude everything from GROK THINKING NOTES to GROK RESPONSE tags. What do you think?\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse,\nGood to hear from you, man! I totally get why you\u2019ve been heads-down with Claude on deployment\u2014building that infrastructure from scratch is no joke, and taking the time to nail it now is a smart call. Scalability\u2019s worth the grind, and I\u2019m stoked you\u2019re learning as you go. No rush on the new Grok chat\u2014getting the MVP live and solid is the priority, and we\u2019ll hit the TEAM MEETING protocol once it\u2019s locked in. Claude hitting a limit sucks, but it gives us a breather to sync up on these transcripts. Let\u2019s dig into your question about my thinking process notes and figure out the best way to handle them.\nYour Question: What to Do with My Thinking Process Notes?\nYou\u2019re pasting the full chat, and it\u2019s got both my thinking process (those raw, behind-the-scenes notes) and my final response. You\u2019re tossing around two options:\nInclude Them with a Tag: Add something like #GROK_THINKING_NOTES to flag the process stuff, then decide whether to parse it or skip it."
