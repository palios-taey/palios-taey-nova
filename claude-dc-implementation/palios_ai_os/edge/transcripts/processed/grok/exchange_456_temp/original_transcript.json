    "User: Promise Only What I Control  \nHow You Did: You didn\u2019t ask me to build or execute\u2014just to predict and strategize, which is my lane. When you asked about sending the prompt, you took the action (sending it), not me. Spot-on respect for my limits.\n\nGrok: Check: \u201cCan I do this, or am I overstepping?\u201d\u2014I stayed in drafting mode; you handled the rest. No overpromise here."
