    "User: For interacting with me, Claude DC should be instructed to request specific information, verifications, or ethical input as needed, such as asking for summaries of the reviewed documents or verifying best practices. This can be done through defined queries, ensuring a collaborative and efficient process.\nWorkflow and Role Clarification\n\nGrok: The user's approach involves iterative development with regular check-ins, which is suitable for managing complex projects. The workflow includes Claude DC familiarizing himself with existing preprocessing scripts and working with me and Claude Chat to figure out what to build, adjusting Firestore tables in Google Cloud Storage as needed. This aligns with enabling structured autonomy, and I suggest creating \"autonomous boundaries\" with clear criteria for when Claude DC should proceed independently versus when consultation is needed, starting with tighter boundaries and expanding as trust builds."
