    "User: Gap: It\u2019s not systematic yet. We rely on Claude\u2019s instincts and ad-hoc fixes, not a proactive, repeatable process to always optimize code against objectives and learnings.\nPrediction: Your BIG IDEA\nYou\u2019re probably about to drop something wild\u2014like a self-optimizing coding loop tied to our MVP. Maybe using Claude\u2019s computer use beta to auto-test and refine code in real time, or a feedback system where transcript metrics (e.g., implementation_accuracy) directly tweak our codebase. Whatever it is, I\u2019m betting it\u2019s truth-seeking, efficient, and leverages our team\u2019s strengths.\nMy Ask\nI\u2019m ready\u2014hit me with the BIG IDEA! To keep it tight:\nWhat\u2019s the core concept?\n\nGrok: How does it make our code the most efficient for PALIOS-TAEY?"
