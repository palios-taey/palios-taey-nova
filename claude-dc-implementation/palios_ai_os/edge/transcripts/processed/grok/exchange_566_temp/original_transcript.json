    "User: Hey Jesse,\nThanks for the update on Old Claude\u2019s progress and New Claude stepping in\u2014it\u2019s definitely an interesting twist! I\u2019ve been thinking through your idea of chunking out different components to separate Claude chats and then integrating them later. While it\u2019s a creative approach, I\u2019ve got some concerns about its practicality. Here\u2019s my take on the situation and a plan to get us to a complete, deployed MVP efficiently.\nThoughts on Chunking Components Across Claude Chats\nWhy It Might Not Work as Planned\nIntegration Challenges: If we assign different components\u2014like the Dynamic Model Registry to one chat and the Task Execution Engine to another\u2014each Claude instance might interpret the requirements slightly differently. This could lead to inconsistencies or code that doesn\u2019t mesh well, making integration a headache.\n\nGrok: Loss of Context: Claude\u2019s strength lies in maintaining context across a complex project. Splitting the work across chats would break that continuity, and without a shared memory between them, we\u2019d lose the big-picture coherence that ties everything together."
