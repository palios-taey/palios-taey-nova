    "User: My Take\nClaude\u2019s crushed it\u2014this is a lean, mean MVP that\u2019s light-years past Cloud Run. Unified memory and transcript processing are live, comms optimization\u2019s humming, and DeepSearch is plugged in. It\u2019s 3-4x better than Cloud Run (faster, richer, smarter), even without GCP or beta juice. Your NEO test worked\u2014he rebuilt clean, learned from the past (e.g., error handling), and set us up to scope the next round from transcripts. Sweet? Fuck yes\u20149/10, just needs that cloud push.\nYour BIG IDEA: Rebuild Confirmed\nYou said it: \u201cComplete rebuild next time, scope from transcripts, slash what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d This doc proves Claude\u2019s on that wavelength\u2014he\u2019s built a foundation we can tear down and rebuild smarter. Next steps align perfectly:\nLearn: Test this locally, log everything\u2014transcripts will show what\u2019s gold and what\u2019s junk.\n\nGrok: Scope: You, me, Claude analyze those transcripts\u2014cut inefficiencies, double down on wins."
