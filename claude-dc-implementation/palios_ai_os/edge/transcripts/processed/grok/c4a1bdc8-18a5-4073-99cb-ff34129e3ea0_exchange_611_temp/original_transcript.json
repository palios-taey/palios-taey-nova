    "The process involved constructing the appropriate Google Drive URL for access. Given the FILE_ID, the view link was formed as https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZI845SFV2UHSoulNI-JkgZhxv2Pz3Rx/view?usp=sharing, and attempts were made to extract the content. However, challenges arose, as initial attempts to use the direct download link, https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1YZI845SFV2UHSoulNI-JkgZhxv2Pz3Rx, resulted in a sign-in prompt, indicating potential access restrictions. Subsequent attempts with the view link and queries like \"extract transcript text\" yielded no readable text, suggesting the file might not be publicly accessible or required authentication."
