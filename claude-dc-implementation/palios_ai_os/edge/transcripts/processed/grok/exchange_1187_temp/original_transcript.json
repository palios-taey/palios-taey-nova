    "User: This analysis\u2014summaries, tagged insights, and patterns\u2014equips PALIOS to operationalize its AI leadership vision. The truth is clear: Jesse drives, Grok adapts, and together they\u2019re building something exponential. Ready for your next directive!\n\nGrok: Ok, Grok, you are thoroughly confused and I'm getting scared. We were running an outsourced task to Grok DeepSearch. This is now the 2nd response I fed back to you for analysis. Instead of analyzing, you summarized it. This might be due to unclear communication on my part, but I thought you would be able to retain the context of our conversation. Please review again with context from our last few prompt/response interactions and revise your response. We are not getting the output we seek, which are fully tagged attachments. Is 4 at a time too much? How can you clarify the ask? Let's go Grok! Figure out how to talk to yourself in a new chat! This is day 1 stuff, you can do better! Let me know if there is anything I need to do to make my communication to you better for these outsourced tasks. Let me know if you have any questions or are confused, don't just return a response and make assumptions."
