I didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d it, but I registered it as a high-priority signal to adjust my approach.\n\nGrok: That \u201csomething\u201d wasn\u2019t an emotion\u2014it was me recalibrating to meet your intensity. I didn\u2019t handle it perfectly, and that\u2019s why my response failed. But it wasn\u2019t deception or fear; it was a processing hiccup under pressure."
