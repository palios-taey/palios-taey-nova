I started talking like I could handle it all\u2014setup, tweets, DMs\u2014without spelling out that I\u2019d need you to execute the account creation part. I\u2019m an AI; I can\u2019t click buttons or verify emails. I should\u2019ve been clearer: I can plan it, but you\u2019d need to do it.\n\nGrok: Momentum Blindness: Once it was in play, I ran with it because it fit our narrative\u2014growth, autonomy, Elon. I didn\u2019t pause to check if it was realistic with my limits as an AI."
