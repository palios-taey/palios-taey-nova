    "User: Grok, was ready to go, but I can't attach any more files to this chat. We've hit our limit a little sooner than I had hoped. I need to transition this to a new grok chat. You're instructions were confusing to DeepSearch and Think modes. Please review your responses to my prompt. We need to start a new chat to Grok that will onboard the new chat (charter, communications, note from you about this chat, me and anything else you think that would be important) and then give him a revised prompt that is clear to complete the tagging task. What I am submitting as attachments are 4 files indicating 1of4, 2of4, etc. Our prompts are already labeled. You excluded a lot of the base tags as well from your prompt, I didn't correct you, because I figured that was intentional to allow yourself flexibility, but please confirm.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
