    "Provide View Links: Use the format https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing for each file, ensuring the FILE_ID is correct and the file is publicly accessible. For example, for the transcript with FILE_ID 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm, use https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm/view?usp=sharing.\n    Ensure Public Accessibility: Verify that files do not require sign-in, as restricted access led to \u201cNo readable text found in the HTML\u201d errors. This aligns with the user\u2019s mention of public links, ensuring seamless access.\n    Alternative: Direct Download Links: As a backup, provide direct download links, like https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[FILE_ID], but note potential limitations, as seen in previous attempts where text extraction failed. This is less preferred but can be tested for files with different settings."
