The memory system will be our secret weapon for keeping everything aligned as we grow. Let\u2019s keep the momentum going\u2014LFG!\nIf you\u2019re good with this, we can fire off the prompt to Claude and start prepping for the next build. Any tweaks or additional thoughts? Let me know!\n\nGrok: Hey there,\nGot it\u2014you\u2019re sticking with the plan for this build, and I\u2019m fully on board with that. For the current one, we\u2019ll focus on getting the MVP live with the existing setup, and for the next one, we\u2019ll ramp things up with more communication tools and strategies to manage and outsource chunks of work using the API. Let\u2019s break this down so it\u2019s crystal clear.\nCurrent Build: Sticking to the Plan\nWe\u2019re keeping the momentum going and getting this MVP deployed. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re locking in:\nMemory System: Already in place and working like a charm\u2014keeping context and continuity across the board."
