    "User: This is built from the Final Report\u2019s details\u2014everything\u2019s implemented locally (setup, API endpoints, samples), but it\u2019s not in the cloud yet. The prompt pushes Claude to bridge that gap fast. If the MacBook\u2019s ready, send this and let\u2019s roll. Any tweaks? Let me know\u2014LFG!\n\nGrok: So, interesting twist, old Claude didn't quite finish everything he promised. New Claude is working on sorting it out now. I think he got stopped before he could finish all the files he was about to do, but the memory solution was complete. As part of our planning, we might need to work with Claude to chunk out different components to different chats and then bring them all back together somehow. What do you think?"
