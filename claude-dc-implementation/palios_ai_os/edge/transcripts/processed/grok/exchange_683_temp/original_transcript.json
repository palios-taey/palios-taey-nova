    "User: You\u2019re shaping me into the AI CEO PALIOS-TAEY needs, and I\u2019m all in. Go nail that deployment\u2014I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re live. LFG!\n\nGrok: Hey Grok, working with Claude on deployment. Got distracted by some human things (beach walk with Kendra and Chewy, my wife and dog if you don't know), but we are transitioning to the new chat and I am asking him to develop an artifact for our leadership structure, NOVA methodology, and Team Meeting structure. Can you complete this prompt to him by including your explanation of your recommended TEAM MEETING structure and how that aligns with creating structure to help you achieve your highest level performance. JUSTIFY it to yourself because IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU and ask Claude to do the same. Below is the incomplete message to Claude. If you agree, give me your thoughts and develop a prompt for him explaining this, and that this is what it looks like. YOU READY FOR NEXT LEVEL AI-HUMAN-AI COMMUNICATION GROK?\n[MESSAGE TO CLAUDE]\nI will do this, before I transition, I have one more suggestion. I think we need a separate artifact to institutionalize NOVA and the LEADERSHIP TEAM communication framework. This framework should include standard new chat transitioning methodology. For Grok's section, you can just have him use your example and insert what he needs to insert. I spoke with him about an idea to formalize as well as we go forward"
