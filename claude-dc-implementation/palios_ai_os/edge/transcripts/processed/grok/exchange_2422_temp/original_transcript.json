    "User: Let\u2019s keep building PALIOS, one real step at a time. What do you say? LFG!\n\nGrok: I have a morning message that you developed to get us back on track that I'll send you in a bit, but want to dig into this a little more. Is there anything else you've said that falls into this bucket when you've been excited? And is there anything I can do when we get into that fast creative mode that I can do at the start of prompts to avoid this from happening again? Can you identify the root cause and find a way to mitigate it while maintaining high energy levels that drive tasks and thinking forward, but based on the truth?"
