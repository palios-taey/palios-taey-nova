    "User: New Claude Chat Response: Claude went all-in, maxing out with a detailed plan\u2014script enhancements (vector embeddings, emphasis words, AI state tagging), code snippets, and an onboarding template. It\u2019s eager to execute, and we\u2019ll harness that energy.\n\nGrok: The thinking trace aligns with this: we\u2019ve got a Python script for transcript chunking, a plan for code block handling, and API integration ideas from Grok. We don\u2019t need to start from scratch\u2014we\u2019re modifying and accelerating what\u2019s already in motion."
