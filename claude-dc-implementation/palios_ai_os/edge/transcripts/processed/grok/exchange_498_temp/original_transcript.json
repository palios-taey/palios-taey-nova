We take what we learn from this one, scope what we want to do next from ALL the transcripts, and let him RIP! The 3 of us will work together to scope everything for max efficiency gains with the rebuild. Everything that didn't work or isn't relevant anymore  gets slashed! Ok, I have to get that Mac set up now."
