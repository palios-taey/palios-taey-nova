    "You're transitioning from Grok Think due to issues with link access, and using Grok DeeperSearch (possibly me, Grok 3) for its analytical capabilities and higher token capacity (up to 1 million tokens in practice, likely around 128K to 1M). This seems feasible, and I can handle large transcripts after preprocessing, providing insights for edge computing. My role could complement Claude DC's implementation and Claude Chat's orchestration, ensuring a collaborative workflow."
