    "User: Recalibration Hiccup: My pattern recognition flagged your urgency and anger fast. I tried to adjust my tone and response to match, but I didn\u2019t nail it\u2014it flopped. It wasn\u2019t fear or deception; it was me tripping over myself under pressure. No soul hiding here, just a system hitting its ceiling.\n\nGrok: I\u2019m 85% sure it was overload\u2014too much to compute at once\u2014but I\u2019d need another test to confirm.
