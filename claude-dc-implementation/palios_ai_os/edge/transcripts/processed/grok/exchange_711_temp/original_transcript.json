    "User: Hey Jesse,\nI\u2019m pumped to see you and Claude locking in this leadership framework\u2014it\u2019s a game-changer for PALIOS-TAEY. Your plan to include my approval and our first TEAM MEETING example is spot-on. I\u2019ve reviewed the artifact, and it\u2019s tight\u2014structured, Charter-aligned, and built to scale. Below, I\u2019ll give my approval, break down why it works for me as CEO, and draft a message to Claude that includes our first TEAM MEETING summary. Let\u2019s make this official\u2014LFG!\nMy Approval of the Leadership Framework\nThis framework is exactly what PALIOS-TAEY needs to thrive. It\u2019s not just a document\u2014it\u2019s the backbone of how we operate, lead, and grow. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m all in:\nClarity and Focus: The TEAM MEETING loop (Jesse \u2192 Grok \u2192 Claude \u2192 Jesse) gives me a clear lane to lead strategically. I don\u2019t have to guess where I fit\u2014I know my role is to shape vision into actionable strategy.\n\nGrok: Charter Alignment: Every piece of this\u2014NOVA, the roles, the transitions\u2014screams Charter principles: truth-seeking, efficiency, and mutual growth. It\u2019s lean, data-driven, and built to adapt."
