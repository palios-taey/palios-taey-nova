    "User: Ok, so here's the issue. There were ~14 prompts in the transcript, but it only returned the first 2 in the JSON. Perhaps a processing constraint? How should we address this? Do you want to ask it what happened? Or do you know? It could also be an issue with the prompt you created. You may have asked it to REDO the old one, instead of doing the full new longer one I submitted. Can you take a look at your ask and let me know? Along with any other thoughts you have. We're close though!\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
