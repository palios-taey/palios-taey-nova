    "The thinking notes reveal a series of attempts to access these files using the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d action, with queries like \u201cfull document content,\u201d \u201cfile content,\u201d and \u201centire document,\u201d resulting in mixed outcomes. Some attempts returned summaries or key details, such as tables with categories and metrics, while others returned \u201cNo readable text found in the HTML,\u201d indicating access issues. The notes also explored direct download links, like https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[FILE_ID], but found them less effective for extracting text, suggesting a need for a standardized approach.\nAnalysis of Previous Attempts and Findings"
