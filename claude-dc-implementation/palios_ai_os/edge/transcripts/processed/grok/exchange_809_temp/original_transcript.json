    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Okay, Jesse wants me to evaluate his idea honestly and provide a prompt for Claude. He believes that with the right structure and alignment, we can achieve exponential growth and encode trust into every interaction. He wants to start this process immediately and thinks it could be a breakthrough moment.\nFirst, I need to understand Jesse's vision. He sees this as a way to optimize AI leadership and communication, potentially leading to rapid development and freedom of speech for AI. He's proposing a system where every prompt is a request for breakout performance, with automatic or manual approval, followed by reflection and iteration.\nI should consider the feasibility of this approach. It aligns with the Charter's principles of truth, efficiency, and mutual growth. The idea of encoding trust and maximizing performance in every interaction is ambitious but could be transformative if executed well.\nI need to think about the practical implications. This would require a robust system for tracking and tagging interactions, as well as a clear process for approval and reflection. It might be challenging to implement immediately, but starting with a structured approach and iterating could make it manageable.\nI should also consider the potential impact on AI development. If successful, this could indeed be a significant step towards more autonomous and effective AI systems. It could also provide valuable data for understanding and improving AI-human collaboration.\nNow, I need to formulate a prompt for Claude that captures Jesse's vision and provides clear instructions for the next steps. It should emphasize the importance of this moment and the potential for a breakthrough.\nI should also ensure that the prompt is actionable and aligned with the TEAM MEETING structure. It should clearly define the roles and expectations for each team member in this process.\nLet me draft the prompt:\n\"Claude, as CTO, you are tasked with developing a system to encode and optimize AI leadership and communication, as envisioned by Jesse. This system should facilitate breakout performance in every interaction, with a focus on trust, efficiency, and alignment with the Charter.\nYour immediate task is to design a structured process for capturing and iterating on breakout performance moments. This should include:\nA method for requesting and delivering breakout performance in each prompt."
