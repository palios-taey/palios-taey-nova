    "User: Extra Work for You: Managing multiple chats, tracking their outputs, and stitching the pieces together would fall on you as the facilitator. That\u2019s a lot of manual effort, which goes against our goal of keeping this lean and autonomous.\n\nGrok: A Simpler Alternative\nSince the memory solution is already complete, we can use it to our advantage. Instead of splitting the work across chats, let\u2019s have New Claude pick up where Old Claude left off in a single, focused effort. Here\u2019s why this makes sense:\nContext Continuity: Keeping everything in one Claude session (or across sessions using the memory system) ensures the new work builds seamlessly on what\u2019s already done."
