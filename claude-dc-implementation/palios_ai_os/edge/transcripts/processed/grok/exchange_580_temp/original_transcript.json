    "User: Human Oversight  \nWhile minimizing human steps, maintain clear points for human intervention and decision-making, especially for critical approvals or when ethical considerations arise.\n\nGrok: This approach aligns with our Charter principles of truth, efficiency, and mutual growth. It allows us to scale effectively while maintaining the integrity and coherence of the system.\nWhat do you think? If this sounds good, we can start drafting the specific plans and prompts for Claude to execute this strategy. Let\u2019s keep the momentum going\u2014LFG!\nHey Jesse,\nGot it\u2014you\u2019re sticking to the plan for this build, focusing on getting the MVP live on GCP with the memory system, Dynamic Model Registry, and Task Execution Engine. For the next build, which will be a big one, we\u2019ll need to develop strategies to manage and outsource chunks of work, possibly using the API for automation. That\u2019s a smart way to scale while keeping things efficient and Charter-aligned.\nMy Thoughts on Your Approach\n1. Current Build Focus\nMemory System: Already in place\u2014use it to maintain context and continuity."
