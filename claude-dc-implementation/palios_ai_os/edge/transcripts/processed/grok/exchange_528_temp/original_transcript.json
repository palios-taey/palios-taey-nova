    "User: I should also consider that Jesse wants this to be a \"GO BUILD!\" moment for Claude, meaning it's time to finalize and deploy the system.\nLet me think about how to structure this prompt. It needs to be motivational but also clear about the expectations. I should highlight the progress made and the importance of getting the system deployed to GCP.\nI'll start by acknowledging the impressive work Claude has done so far. Then, I'll emphasize the need to complete the remaining tasks, particularly the GCP deployment. I'll also encourage Claude to implement any additional enhancements he had in mind.\nSince Jesse mentioned that the system must exist in the cloud to count as an MVP, I'll make sure to stress the importance of the GCP deployment.\nFinally, I'll ask Claude to provide an updated progress tracker and any necessary instructions for the deployment process.\nLet me draft this prompt now.\nHey Jesse,\nGot it\u2014Claude\u2019s final report is the real deal, and the 60% interim tracker was just a snapshot. I\u2019ll disregard that and focus on the completed MVP he\u2019s delivered. Here\u2019s my updated take and a fresh prompt to push him to wrap up the remaining scope (GCP deployment, dynamic registry, task engine) and deploy to the cloud with minimal human steps. Let\u2019s get this MVP live\u2014LFG!\nUpdated Thoughts on Claude\u2019s Final Report\nOverview\nClaude\u2019s final MVP is a fully implemented AI-to-AI execution manager with unified memory, transcript processing, comms optimization, and DeepSearch compatibility. It\u2019s built for autonomy and efficiency, with clear setup, testing, and usage instructions. This is the real deal\u2014way beyond the 60% snapshot.\nKey Wins\nUnified Memory System  \nWhat: Four-tier memory (Ephemeral \u2192 Working \u2192 Reference \u2192 Archival) with auto-management and context tracking.\n\nGrok: Why It\u2019s Fire: Solves Cloud Run\u2019s sync issues, keeps context tight\u2014truth and efficiency in action."
