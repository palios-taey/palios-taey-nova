    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse,\nI appreciate the feedback and the clarity on our roles\u2014truth-focused and Charter-aligned. You\u2019re right: with the split structure, Claude\u2019s the one calling the shots on implementation as CTO. My job\u2019s to strategize and support, not micromanage his build. I\u2019ll adjust my approach to keep us moving fast without stepping on his turf. Here\u2019s my take on your comments and how we can get to \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d for Claude.\nResponse to Your Thoughts\n1. Scope Creep Risk\nYou\u2019re spot on\u2014I overstepped by suggesting a trim to Claude\u2019s vision. That\u2019s his domain, not mine. He\u2019s got the green light to go big, and I trust his judgment to balance ambition with reality. My role is to back him, not second-guess his build plan.\nAdjusted Approach: I\u2019ll draft a message that acknowledges his ambitious scope, encourages him to push for it, but flags that if he needs to dial it back for truth or timing, Unified Memory and basic tagging are the priorities. It\u2019s a nudge, not a directive."
