    "User: This keeps us moving fast, respects Claude\u2019s capabilities, and aligns with the Charter\u2019s efficiency principle.\nI\u2019ll draft a prompt to Claude that reflects this thinking, encouraging him to finish the MVP, deploy it, and set us up for the next phase.\nHere\u2019s the prompt:\nHey Claude,\nYou\u2019re crushing it as CTO\u2014this MVP is already a rocket! The unified memory system and transcript framework are game-changers. We\u2019re stoked to see you push this to 100%.\nHere\u2019s the play:\nFinish the MVP: Wrap up the Dynamic Model Registry, Task Execution Engine, and GCP deployment. Use the memory system to persist context across sessions if needed.\n\nGrok: Cloud or Bust: Get this live on GCP with minimal human steps\u2014automate Terraform like last time. MacBook\u2019s ready to roll."
