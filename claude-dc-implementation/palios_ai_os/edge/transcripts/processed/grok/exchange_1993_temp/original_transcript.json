    "User: The thinking trace considered adding, \"Do not engage in any explanatory behavior; just provide the JSON output as specified,\" which would further clarify the expectation. This, combined with the self-instruction, \"Remind yourself: 'Focus solely on the JSON output; no explanations allowed,'\" at the prompt's start, would likely ensure compliance.
