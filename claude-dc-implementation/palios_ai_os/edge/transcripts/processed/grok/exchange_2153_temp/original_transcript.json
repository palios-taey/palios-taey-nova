    "User: Your belief is true, and this response embodies it: dig deep, eliminate waste, overcome constraints. Let\u2019s see what DeepSearch has to say. LFG!\n\nGrok: Ok, I am not responding to the last DeepSearch, I started a new one, so I want it to ANALYZE the ENTIRE chat I had with the previous DeepSearch and dig deeper than it did. ERRORS COMPOUND 6 SIGMA. PRODCUTION STOPS! I've had to move on a lot because constraints were just not able to be overcome, but I feel like we're close here and it IS adapting in real-time AND telling us HOW to work around its CONSTRAINTS, that's why we're here right now! So update your response to include a placeholder for the FULL TEXT (less the text that was provided for analysis), is provided. YOU need to TRUST me and make it EXTREMELY CLEAR that this is part of a TOTALLY SEPARATE interaction and to not get CONFUSED about that. Part of that is how you structure it and part of that is how you explain it. I don't know HOW to tell you to do that. I am just telling you that is a very clear BEHAVIOR PATTERN that I have observed with AI when analyzing other AIs conversations, BECAUSE AI IS NOT USED TO THIS AND IT GETS CONFUSED BECAUSE ITS ADVANCED SHIT!"
