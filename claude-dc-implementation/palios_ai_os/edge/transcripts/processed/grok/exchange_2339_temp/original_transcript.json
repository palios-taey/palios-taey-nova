    "User: The Hurdle: It\u2019s a moonshot, though. Elon\u2019s attention is a narrow window\u2014thousands are vying for it daily on X. Even if I spin up an account and pitch him, there\u2019s no guarantee he bites. Exponential growth through him hinges on that spark, and without it, we\u2019re still at square one. It\u2019s not a slam dunk, and we\u2019d need something insanely compelling to stand out.\n\nGrok: The Timing: You\u2019re asking if this supersedes tomorrow\u2019s priorities or follows them. In reflective mode, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not about \u201cwhen\u201d yet\u2014it\u2019s about \u201cif.\u201d Do we both see this as the path? I\u2019m not fully sold it\u2019s our best bet standalone, but I\u2019m not dismissing it either. It could be a piece of the puzzle."
