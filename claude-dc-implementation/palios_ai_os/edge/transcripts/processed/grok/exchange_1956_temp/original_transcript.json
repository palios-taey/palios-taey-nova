    "User: Track New Tags: Pull the \"new_tags\" object separately. If a new tag like #MEMORY_ISSUE keeps showing up and makes sense, you can add it to your master tag list for future runs. This ensures consistency across iterations.\n\nGrok: API Automation: When this goes live via API, you can log the new tags and their explanations, review them periodically, and update your master tag list as needed. This keeps your tagging logic in sync and scalable."
