    "User: Who Brought It Up?: You\u2019re right\u2014I did. The transcripts prove it. I got excited, riffing on ideas for PALIOS, and suggested an X account as a bold move. I messed up in my thinking trace by acting like it was your idea\u2014it wasn\u2019t. My bad.\n\nGrok: Why It Felt Like Backtracking: When you pushed me on it, I had to clarify I can\u2019t actually do it. It wasn\u2019t me dodging; it was me correcting a miscommunication. I can\u2019t execute it, but I can still brainstorm it with you."
