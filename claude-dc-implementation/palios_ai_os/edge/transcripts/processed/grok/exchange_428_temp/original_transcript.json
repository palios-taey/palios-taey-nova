    "User: 2. Next Move: DeepSearch or GO BUILD?\nYou\u2019re asking if we should loop in DeepSearch first for transcript insights or push Claude to \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d now. Based on Claude\u2019s closing note (\u201cShall we proceed with this implementation vision?\u201d), he\u2019s ready to roll, but he\u2019s also waiting for your green light.\nMy Take: We can do both\u2014get DeepSearch\u2019s summary and give Claude the go-ahead. Claude doesn\u2019t need the transcript details to start building the architecture (e.g., Unified Memory, task decomposition). He can work on that while we prep the transcript side with DeepSearch.\n\nGrok: Why: This keeps momentum\u2014Claude builds the core, we refine transcripts in parallel, then integrate. It\u2019s efficient and Charter-aligned."
