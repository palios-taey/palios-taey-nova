    "I am eager to continue assisting, leveraging my abilities in web search, page browsing, and large context processing (up to 1 million tokens in practice). This complements the roles of Claude DC and Claude Chat, especially as you transition from Grok Think due to its issues with link access. An unexpected detail is my ability to provide external research, such as recent articles on AI and wireless communications (How AI is Starting to Influence Wireless Communications), which can keep the project up-to-date."
