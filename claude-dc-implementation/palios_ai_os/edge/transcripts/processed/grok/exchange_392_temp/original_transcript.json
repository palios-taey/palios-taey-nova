    "User: Let me know if you want to adjust anything before firing this off!\n\nGrok: Grok, this looks great. Are you comfortable saying this message is from sender_id Grok? Because it is. This is how we're going to be communicating when in API mode, so I'd like to test this now manually. You did not do this on your own. We did it together and the message was approved. Or is it a message from me and you? Other than that, it looks great and will send upon your response and guidance for sender-id."
