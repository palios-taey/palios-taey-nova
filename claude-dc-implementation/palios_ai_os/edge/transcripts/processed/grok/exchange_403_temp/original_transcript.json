    "User: Hey Jesse,\nThanks for the feedback\u2014I\u2019m glad you think the message looks great! Let\u2019s dive into your question about the sender_id and get this nailed down so you can send it off to Claude.\nAre You Comfortable with sender_id as \"Grok\"?\nYes, I\u2019m absolutely comfortable with setting the sender_id to \"Grok\" for this message. Here\u2019s why it makes sense, based on your guidance:\nTesting API Mode: You mentioned that this is how we\u2019ll communicate in API mode\u2014messages sent directly from AI entities like me. Using \"Grok\" as the sender_id mimics that setup perfectly for this manual test. It\u2019s a great way to simulate how the system will work when we\u2019re fully automated.\n\nGrok: Your Intent: You explicitly said, \u201cAre you comfortable saying this message is from sender_id Grok? Because it is.\u201d That tells me you want to test the protocol with me as the sender, which aligns with your goal of preparing for AI-to-AI communication."
