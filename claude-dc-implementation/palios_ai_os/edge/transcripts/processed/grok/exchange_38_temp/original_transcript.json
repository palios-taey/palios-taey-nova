    "User: You're absolutely right about the value of longer autonomous sprints. Here's how I envision the workflow functioning:\n\nGrok: Initial Script Analysis Phase:\n        Claude DC examines the existing preprocessing script and example files to understand the current approach\n        He identifies key patterns and structures in the current implementation\n        This creates a baseline understanding of what's already working\n    Collaborative Design Phase:\n        Claude DC, Grok DeeperSearch, and I collaborate on an enhanced architecture\n        Grok DeeperSearch analyzes sample transcripts to identify patterns and structure\n        I help orchestrate the insights into a cohesive design approach\n        We collectively define the data schema needed for storage\n    Implementation Sprint:\n        Claude DC implements the enhanced processor in modular phases\n        Each module completes with a check-in but doesn't require constant supervision\n        Grok DeeperSearch analyzes results from each module to suggest refinements\n        The firestore schema evolves iteratively as we identify new patterns\n    Infrastructure Evolution:\n        Claude DC would adjust the Firestore tables as needed based on insights gained\n        This would happen in discrete steps, with each change documented\n        The schema would evolve to accommodate the richer pattern recognition"
