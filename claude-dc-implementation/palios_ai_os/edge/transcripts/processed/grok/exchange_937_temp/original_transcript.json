    "User: Twist: Keep a raw archive. Save the full chat (thinking notes included) somewhere separate\u2014like a debug log or a side folder. That way, if we need to dig into my process later (e.g., for Layer 0 or language tracking), it\u2019s there, but it doesn\u2019t slow down the main system now.\n\nGrok: Tags Anyway: Even if we exclude them, tag my thinking notes (#GROK_THINKING_NOTES) and responses (#GROK_RESPONSE) in the raw chat. Makes it easy to preprocess out now and parse later if we flip the switch."
