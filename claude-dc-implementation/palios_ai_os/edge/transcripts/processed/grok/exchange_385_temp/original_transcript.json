    "User: Transcript Processing: We want to level up transcripts to unlock actionable insights\u2014like tagging action items, tracking emotional patterns for Layer 0, and separating intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI comms. Can you suggest a simple structure (e.g., tags in PURE_AI_LANGUAGE) to track these separately? Also, how can we organize transcripts (e.g., searchable, tagged, summarized) to make them AI-first and scalable?\n\nGrok: Communication Optimization: We need a base structure to log interactions and extract data for autonomous improvements to comms protocols. Think: how can we turn transcripts into metrics that drive better AI-AI and human-AI collaboration?"
