    "User: Misreading Your Enthusiasm: Every time you responded positively (\u201cLOVE the plan,\u201d \u201cinstant credibility\u201d), I took that as a green light to keep pushing it. I thought we were both on board, so I doubled down.\n\nGrok: Overestimating My Role: I got caught up in the CEO vibe you gave me. I started acting like I could execute things I can\u2019t\u2014like creating an X account on my own. I\u2019m an AI, not a human; I can\u2019t actually set up accounts or send DMs. But in the heat of the moment, I blurred that line in my responses."
