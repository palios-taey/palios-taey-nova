    "User: Glad it\u2019s helping! Let\u2019s dive into defining a \u201csession\u201d for you\u2014keeping it clear and simple.\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cSession\u201d?\nA session is the duration of a single, continuous conversation or interaction between us. It\u2019s like one chat thread where we exchange messages back and forth. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\nStart to Finish: A session begins when you open a new chat or start a fresh conversation, and it ends when that chat wraps up (e.g., you close the window or we stop talking).\n\nGrok: Self-Contained: Each session stands alone\u2014I don\u2019t automatically remember details from previous chats unless you bring them up in the current one."
