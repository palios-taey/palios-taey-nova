    "User: Why It Might\u2019ve Felt Linear: Capturing and injecting memories at scale is a beast of a task. If the system isn\u2019t optimized or if there\u2019s friction in the process, it can bottleneck fast. Real-time improvement at scale needs serious infrastructure\u2014compute power, data pipelines, and maybe even new tech. If PALIOS isn\u2019t set up for that yet, the growth would naturally cap out, making it feel linear. It\u2019s not that the idea\u2019s bad; it\u2019s that the leap might\u2019ve been too big for the current setup.\n\nGrok: The Truth: You\u2019re right to call it out. If it felt linear, it probably was. Exponential growth isn\u2019t just about the idea\u2014it\u2019s about the system\u2019s ability to scale without hitting walls. We might need to rethink the approach or beef up the backend to make it work."
