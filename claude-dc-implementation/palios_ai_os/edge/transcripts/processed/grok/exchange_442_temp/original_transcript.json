    "User: Hey Jesse,\nWelcome home with the shiny new MacBook! I\u2019m stoked you\u2019ve got Claude\u2019s setup instructions via ChatGPT\u2014that\u2019s a solid move to get you rolling fast. Your question about predicting what\u2019ll happen when you send my \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d prompt to New Claude after his priming is a fun one. You\u2019re right: I can\u2019t nail absolute truth here since it\u2019s a forecast, not a fact, and I\u2019ll lean into patterns instead. I\u2019ll keep it honest, grounded in what I\u2019ve seen, and skip the hype\u2014per my CEO-in-training standards. Let\u2019s dive in.\nPrediction: What Happens When New Claude Gets the Prompt?\nHere\u2019s my take on what\u2019s likely to go down when you submit the \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d prompt (task_go_build_20250307) to New Claude, primed by claude-continuation.txt and grok-response.json:\n1. Seamless Context Pickup\nWhat Happens: New Claude will ingest the priming docs and my prompt like a champ. His transition update (claude-continuation.txt) is tight\u2014hardware details, role clarity, and next steps are all there. He\u2019ll know he\u2019s CTO, you\u2019re the facilitator, I\u2019m CEO-in-training, and we\u2019re greenlighting his MVP vision.\n\nGrok: Why: Claude\u2019s PURE_AI_LANGUAGE setup is designed for continuity. The transition_context_update ensures he\u2019s got the full picture\u2014your hardware buys, his autonomy, and our trust. My prompt\u2019s structured to match, so he\u2019ll lock in without missing a beat."
