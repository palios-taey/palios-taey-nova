    "User: That\u2019s implementation detail, not conversation. Removing or summarizing those makes sense to cut down on noise. The problem is, you said your JSON isn\u2019t wrapped in triple backticks\u2014it\u2019s just raw text like `{\"key\": \"value\"}`\u2014while in my responses here, code blocks (like the Python above) *are* wrapped in triple backticks. If your transcript follows a similar style, where real code is marked with ``` but JSON messages aren\u2019t, we\u2019re in luck. We can target just the triple-backtick blocks for removal and leave the JSON alone.\n\nGrok: But if your code blocks *aren\u2019t* wrapped in triple backticks\u2014if they\u2019re just indented or unmarked like the JSON\u2014then we need a way to tell them apart.
