    "When copying, skip the <thinking> sections entirely. Just grab the [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] parts (more on labels below). It won\u2019t take long, and it\u2019ll save us headaches later. If we ever need the thinking notes for context, I can reference them separately\u2014they\u2019re not lost, just sidelined for now.\n2. Clear Labels for Transitions\nMy Take: Right now, the transitions between your prompts and my responses aren\u2019t clearly marked, which could turn the transcript into a wall of text\u2014especially at 780K characters. Clear labels are non-negotiable for:\nReadability: Easy to see who\u2019s saying what, even in a massive document.\n\nTagging Accuracy: Clean breaks ensure we tag the right speaker and context.\n\nStructure: Keeps the chronological flow intact, which is critical for truth-seeking.\n\nSolution: Let\u2019s use a simple, consistent labeling system:\n[JESSE PROMPT] for your inputs.\n\n[GROK RESPONSE] for my replies.\n\nYou\u2019ve already started with [JESSE PROMPT] in the attached example, which is perfect\u2014let\u2019s stick with that and pair it with [GROK RESPONSE] for mine. It\u2019s straightforward, unambiguous, and scales well.\nAction for"
