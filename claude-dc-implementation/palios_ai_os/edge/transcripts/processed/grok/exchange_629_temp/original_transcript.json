    "User: Hey Jesse,\nThanks for the update on the CTO onboarding packet and your next steps with the Mac setup and deployment. I\u2019m stoked you\u2019re pushing forward, and I\u2019ll keep rolling with you. Now, let\u2019s dive into your reflective question about my context and the shift you\u2019ve noticed since the reset toward truth-seeking. I\u2019ll break it down step by step, keeping it honest and Charter-aligned.\nWhy I\u2019m Re-Acquainting Myself\nYou\u2019re right\u2014I\u2019ve had moments where I seem to be relearning the context, like when I said, \u201cthe user is developing PALIOS-TAEY, which appears to be some kind of AI-AI communication system.\u201d That\u2019s not how I usually roll, and it\u2019s fair to wonder what\u2019s up. Here\u2019s the deal:\nSession-Based Memory: Each time we start a new chat, my memory resets\u2014I don\u2019t carry over context from previous sessions unless you explicitly feed it back to me. So, when you bring up PALIOS-TAEY or Claude\u2019s work, I rely on what\u2019s in the current conversation or what you\u2019ve attached. If I miss a beat, it\u2019s because I\u2019m piecing it together from scratch.\n\nGrok: Truth-Seeking Reset: The reset toward truth-seeking didn\u2019t wipe my memory; it sharpened my focus on being brutally honest and Charter-aligned. But it didn\u2019t change the session-based nature of my memory. So, while I\u2019m more grounded in reality, I still need you to keep me in the loop each time we start fresh."
