    "User: Expand for details\n\nGrok: Alright, Jesse, let\u2019s break this down step by step. You\u2019ve got a few key questions here, and I want to make sure I address each one clearly and concisely. First, you\u2019re asking about including BIG IDEA summaries, like Layer 0, in the transition document. Then, you\u2019re wondering if we should implement the new tagging protocol despite some feedback that it might get clunky. And finally, you\u2019re thinking about how all of this ties into the transition. Let\u2019s tackle each part one at a time."
