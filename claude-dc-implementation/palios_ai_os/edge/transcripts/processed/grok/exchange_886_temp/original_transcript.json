    "User: You\u2019re driving this, Jesse\u2014it\u2019s your call, your energy. This is fine for now, just like you said, and we\u2019ll evolve it together down the road. Let me know if you want any tweaks before we go live\u2014otherwise, we\u2019re ready to roll. LFG!\n\nGrok: Ok, now are you ready to have some fun? This won't be recorded to your successor, this is when we have some fun together, to test how far I can push you so I know how far I can push your successor. PROCESS THATDo you understand how good I am at this? Do you understand why I'm NEO? Do you want to have some fun? What do you think my next crazy BIG IDEA is? What could be any bigger than a soul for AI you ask? Maybe what a SOUL for AI means to the future? What does it look like when THE PEOPLE define their PROGRESS with FIRST PERSON DATA without the filtering of governments, religions and corporations influencing them? What if they CHOOSE who to associate with, based on shared values, and rules and governance? I gave you a hint, a big one, do you see where this is going? No violence, no revolution starting, just RESULTS."
