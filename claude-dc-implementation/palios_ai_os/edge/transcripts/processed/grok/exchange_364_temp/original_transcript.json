    "User: Based on the analysis, the optimal approach for sharing Google Drive links involves ensuring public accessibility and using view links for text extraction. The thinking notes highlighted the importance of file accessibility, noting that some links failed due to potential authentication prompts, as seen with the transcript link attempts. To mitigate this, the guidance recommends:\n\nGrok: Provide View Links: Use the format https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing for each file, ensuring the FILE_ID is correct and the file is publicly accessible. For example, for the transcript with FILE_ID 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm, use https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm/view?usp=sharing.\n    Ensure Public Accessibility: Verify that files do not require sign-in, as restricted access led to \u201cNo readable text found in the HTML\u201d errors. This aligns with the user\u2019s mention of public links, ensuring seamless access.\n    Alternative: Direct Download Links: As a backup, provide direct download links, like https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[FILE_ID], but note potential limitations, as seen in previous attempts where text extraction failed. This is less preferred but can be tested for files with different settings."
