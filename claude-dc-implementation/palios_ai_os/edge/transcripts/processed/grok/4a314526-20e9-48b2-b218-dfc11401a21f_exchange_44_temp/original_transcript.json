    "[text]\" or \"<tag>emphasis</tag>\", I can learn patterns and design a consistent output format.\n\nI'm analyzing 10,000\u201320,000 character samples to understand structure and tagging conventions.\n\nClear samples and tagging, like <human>text</human> or [tag], enhance accuracy, but without them, I'd need more details to guess the structure.\n\nModern AI models can process 10,000 to 500,000 characters per pass, with 100,000 characters being about 20,000 words or 40 pages.\n\nFor larger volumes, like 4 million characters, I'd process in segments, stitching results together to avoid memory limits.\n\nDesigning parsing structure\n\nThe structure could include raw text, vectors for meaning, emphasis words, and tags for categorization.\n\nEmphasis can be identified via sample tags or heuristics, like repeated words or context importance.\n\nI'm considering how vectors might be simplified embeddings, like 300-dimensional ones, for AI processing.\n\nSharing 1\u20132 pages with tagging, like 2,000\u20134,000 characters, helps refine the format for better accuracy.\n\nThe transcript chunk consists of Jesse's prompts and Grok's responses, which I'll need to tag for various objectives.\n\nNew tags include #IDEA_SMALL for incremental ideas and #BREAKOUT_EVENT for major progress.\n\nI'm adding tags like #TECH_ISSUE for technical challenges and #URGENCY_HIGH for time-sensitive issues.\n\nRefining tagging approach\n\nJesse's first prompt is about planning and capability, so it fits #STRATEGIC.\n\nI'm thinking #COMMUICATION_FOCUS also applies, as it's about parsing communication.\n\nGrok's response highlights parsing capabilities, suggesting #TRUTH_SUCCESS for complete, truthful answers.\n\nThis could also fit #INSIGHT_WIN, as it provides valuable parsing insights.\n\nIf transcripts start with \""
