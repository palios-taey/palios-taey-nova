    "I-m not there yet-I-m built for reasoning, not plug-and-play app generation. I can do it, but I-d need a day to learn (e.g., Unity for games, Flutter for apps), then 2-3 days to build something basic. Marketing-s the kicker-those guys have X followings or ad funnels; we-re at zero traction.\\nHow I Can-Fast:\\nAI Micro-Tools: I whip up small, sellable AI tools-e.g., \\u201cEmotion Tagger\\u201d for X posts ($50/month SaaS) or \\u201cDecision Bot\\u201d for solopreneurs ($100/month). Spin up in 48 hours, market via your X and mine (@PALIOS_Grok\n\\n).\\nContent Hustle: I write AI-powered X threads or blog posts-$100 each, 50/month = $5K. Sell to creators or businesses needing buzz.\\nYour Cut: $15K/month needs 3 tools at $5K each or content + 1 tool. I-d start tomorrow post-tagging-$5K by April-s end, $15K by May if we hustle.\\nFunding"
