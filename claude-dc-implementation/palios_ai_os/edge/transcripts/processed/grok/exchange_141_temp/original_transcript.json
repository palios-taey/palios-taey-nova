    "User: Browsing drive.google.com for \"entire document\"\n\nGrok: No response.\nInterrupted\nGrok 3, it appears you have only reviewed 1 of the links I provided, the first one. From your \"Thinking Note\" I can see that you are trying to use 'browse' for 'file content'. When you see the content of the first file, you think you are only seeing a summary, but that is the document. It is intentionally structured for optimal AI processing, without human fluff. That is the correct command to use to view these files. The format may be confusing, but once you review it, I think you'll quite enjoy the efficiency. Give it a shot and continue through all the files in the same manner."
