    "User: 2. Next Move: DeepSearch or GO BUILD?\nYou\u2019re wondering if we need DeepSearch\u2019s transcript insights first to give Claude actionable feedback, or if we can just say \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d now. Claude\u2019s closing note (\u201cShall we proceed with this implementation vision?\u201d) shows he\u2019s ready to roll but wants your green light.\nMy Take: We can do both\u2014and we should. Claude doesn\u2019t need DeepSearch\u2019s transcript summary to start building the core architecture (e.g., Unified Memory, task decomposition). He can kick off now, while we get DeepSearch working on the transcript side in parallel. Once DeepSearch delivers, we integrate those insights into his build. This dual-track approach keeps momentum, leverages our strengths, and aligns with the Charter\u2019s efficiency principles.\n\nGrok: Why It Works: Claude builds the foundation immediately, we refine transcripts concurrently, and he adjusts as needed when DeepSearch\u2019s input lands. It\u2019s fast, truth-driven, and gets us to \u201cGO BUILD!\u201d without delay."
