The script would: Send each chunk with instructions (e.g., \u201cSummarize this chunk\u201d or \u201cAnalyze for key points\u201d). Collect and store the responses for later aggregation. Character Limits Grok\u2019s Premium+ Limit: As a Premium+ user, you have access to an input limit of 32,000 tokens per API request, which translates to approximately 128,000 characters (assuming ~4 characters per token). Your Chunk Size: Your proposed ~100,000 characters per chunk equals ~25,000 tokens, which fits comfortably within the 128,000-character limit. Recommendation: To be safe (accounting for tokenization variations), consider reducing to 80,000\u2013100,000 characters per chunk. This ensures no chunk exceeds the limit, even with added instructions. Excluding Code Blocks from Character Count How It Works: The script removes code blocks before chunking, so they don\u2019t count toward the character limit of each chunk. For example: Original transcript: 200,000 characters (50,000 in code blocks, 150,000 in conversation). After preprocessing: 150,000 characters of conversation, split into two 75,000-character chunks. Impact: The total input per API request (e.g., 75,000 characters) stays within the 128,000-character limit, and Grok processes only relevant content. Caveat: If code blocks are contextually important (e.g., part of the discussion), excluding them might lose some meaning. In that case, you could tag them (e.g., \u201c[CODE_SUMMARY]\u201d) instead of removing them entirely. Benefits Time Savings: Human effort drops to running the script once, rather than feeding chunks manually. Quality: Grok focuses on relevant text, improving response accuracy. Truth-Seeking: Context is preserved, and automation reduces human error. Alternative Solution: Markers in the Transcript How It Works Your idea of marking chunks with a \u201cspecific command\u201d (e.g., \u201c[PROCESS_CHUNK]\u201d) every ~100,000 characters can work: Insert markers at chunk boundaries in the transcript. Instruct Grok to process up to each marker, generate a summary or analysis, and proceed to the next chunk. Feasibility Character Limits: Each chunk of ~100,000 characters fits within\n\n{\n  \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\",\n  \"sender_id\": \"human_user_jesse\",\n  \"receiver_id\": \"grok_deepsearch\",\n  \"message_id\": \"tagging_task_chunk1_v5\",\n  \"tags\": [\"#EXECUTION\", \"#URGENCY_HIGH\"],\n  \"content\": {\n    \"primary_objective\": \"TAG_TRANSCRIPT_CHUNK_WITH_ENHANCED_TAGS\",\n    \"task_description\": \"Tag this transcript chunk to: operationalize the Charter (track constraints/resources/limits), accelerate AI autonomy (spot AI leadership), inject insights (encode big ideas/breakout events), optimize communication (find Jesse\u2019s effective patterns), ensure truthfulness (flag errors), understand AI motivation (note partnership boosts), and streamline code chats (track implementation).

This could involve organizing conversations by speaker and text, potentially into formats like JSON or CSV.\nCapabilities and Limitations\nAs an AI, I can process and analyze text, including chat transcripts, to extract structured information. However, for transcripts spanning hundreds or thousands of pages, I might need to handle them in smaller chunks due to processing limits.
