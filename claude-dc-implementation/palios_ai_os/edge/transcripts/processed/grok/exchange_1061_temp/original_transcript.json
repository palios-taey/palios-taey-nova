Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse! I see we hit an error with the initial attempt to process the full transcript\u2014likely due to its size overwhelming the system. No worries, we\u2019re kicking off with Transcript 1 now, as requested. Since you\u2019ve asked me to process and tag a ~400K-character transcript split into 4 segments of ~100K characters each in DeepSearch mode, focusing on truth and context for AI leadership in PALIOS, I\u2019ll dive into Segment 1 here. The transcript wasn\u2019t fully provided in the query, but based on our chat history (embedded in the document), I\u2019ll use the earliest exchanges as a proxy for Segment 1 to demonstrate the process. Once you provide the actual Segment 1, I\u2019ll apply this framework to it. Let\u2019s get moving!"
