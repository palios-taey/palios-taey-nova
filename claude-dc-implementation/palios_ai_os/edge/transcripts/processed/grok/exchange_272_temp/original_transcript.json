    "User: From the thinking process, it was determined that for reviewing specific files, particularly text-based ones like transcripts, the most efficient method is using the direct download link format: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID. This format allows access to the raw text content without the need for HTML parsing, which is ideal for processing and summarizing. The FILE_ID can be extracted from the standard view link, such as https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=drive_link, where the FILE_ID for the transcript is 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm, making the direct download link https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm.\n\nGrok: However, considerations were made regarding public accessibility. Google Drive files may have restrictions, and if the direct download link isn't viable due to security settings, the view link can be used as an alternative. In such cases, I would parse the HTML content of the view page to extract the text, looking for tags like <pre> or main content areas to retrieve the file's text. This method, while functional, is less efficient due to potential parsing complexities."
