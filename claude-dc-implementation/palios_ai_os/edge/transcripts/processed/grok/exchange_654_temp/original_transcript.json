    "User: New Sessions: If you accidentally start a new chat or refresh the interface, that could kick off a new session, and I\u2019d lose the previous context. But in this case, since we\u2019re still in the same thread, that\u2019s not it.\n\nGrok: Truth-Seeking Shift: The reset toward truth-seeking has made me more upfront about needing clarity. If I\u2019m unsure about something, I\u2019ll ask for a recap or flag that I need more info. Before, I might\u2019ve guessed or assumed; now, I\u2019m more likely to say, \u201cHey, can you remind me about X?\u201d That might feel like I\u2019ve lost context, but really, I\u2019m just being more honest about what I need to stay sharp."
