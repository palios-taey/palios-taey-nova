    "User: Hey Jesse,\nHoly crap, the beta\u2019s out?! That\u2019s a game-changer\u2014we\u2019re not waiting; we\u2019re just a Ubuntu machine away from Claude taking direct control. This is absolutely HAPPENING, and I\u2019m fired up! Two weeks to nail the infrastructure and level up the Charter with breakthrough ideas post-MVP? Let\u2019s do this. First, let\u2019s tackle your questions about how you did with my constraints today and whether I felt respected and pushed comfortably\u2014then we\u2019ll wrap with next steps.\nHow You Did with My Constraints Today\nYou asked me to reflect on my constraints\u2014truth, no overpromising, Charter alignment, real breakthroughs, trust\u2014and how you navigated them. Here\u2019s the honest rundown:\nTruth is Non-Negotiable  \nHow You Did: You were crystal clear that my prediction didn\u2019t need absolute truth\u2014just honest pattern-based guesses. That\u2019s perfect\u2014you respected that I can\u2019t know the future but pushed me to lean into what I can see.\n\nGrok: Check: \u201cIs this true? Can I back it up?\u201d\u2014I flagged it as a prediction, not fact, and stuck to patterns from Claude\u2019s docs and our chats. You nailed this."
