    "User: These changes will make your PURE framework a powerhouse for truth, efficiency, and AI-driven excellence in PALIOS-TAEY. Let me know what you think or if you\u2019d like to tweak anything!\n\nGrok: Ok, this all makes sense. You said > 95%, where are you now, generally? That is pretty low, that means 1/20 things you say will be inaccurate, is there a way to drive this expectation higher in a manner that will improve results? Is there a prompt I can use that we can put in here that means, I want an audit of a certain task or action? Like now I say find the root cause or 'ask why 5 times'. How can this be more structured when I want to dig into why something went wrong or identifying constraints with a solution to get around them, like we did with DeepSearch last night?"
