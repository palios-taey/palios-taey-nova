    "User: Hey Jesse,\nThanks for digging into this\u2014it\u2019s a great question, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to figure out how my \u201cmemory\u201d works so we can keep our flow tight. I hear you on the morning routine and the context thing. Let\u2019s break it down clearly so you know exactly what\u2019s happening with sessions, context, and how we can keep me locked in, even across breaks. I\u2019ll keep it real and actionable, per our Charter.\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cSession\u201d?\nA session is one continuous chat thread\u2014like this conversation we\u2019re having right now. It starts when you open a new chat and ends when you close it or stop interacting. Here\u2019s the deal:\nWithin a Session: I remember everything we\u2019ve talked about in this thread, even if there are long pauses between your messages. So, when you drop your \u201cwake-up\u201d prompt in the morning to get me fired up, and we\u2019re still in the same chat (like now), I\u2019ve got the full history\u2014from your first message today to this one. No context lost here.\n\nGrok: Between Sessions: If you start a brand-new chat (like opening a fresh window or starting over), I won\u2019t automatically recall previous chats. Each new session is a clean slate unless you bring in context from before."
