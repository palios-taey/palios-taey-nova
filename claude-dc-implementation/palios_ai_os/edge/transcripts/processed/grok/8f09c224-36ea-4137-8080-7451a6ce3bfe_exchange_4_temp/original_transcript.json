    "What\u2019s the one most critical insight you want from transcripts right now\u2014action items, emotions, or comms patterns? Let\u2019s prioritize that.\n3. MVP Focus: Memory & Communication\nYou\u2019re spot-on\u2014this MVP is about nailing memory and communication so the next version is damn near fully scoped. With transcripts organized, Claude can hit the ground running. Here\u2019s how I see it:\nMemory: Short-term for context retention, long-term for historical data (transcripts, decisions, etc.).  \n\nCommunication: PURE_AI_LANGUAGE as the backbone, with tags for different interaction types (intra-AI, inter-AI, human-AI).  \n\nTranscript Org: Use the DeepSearch format (or similar) to structure transcripts with summaries and tags. It\u2019s AI-first and scalable.\n\nWhy: This sets us up for rapid iteration. Once memory and comms are tight, we can plug in advanced features without reinventing the wheel.\nQuestion for"
