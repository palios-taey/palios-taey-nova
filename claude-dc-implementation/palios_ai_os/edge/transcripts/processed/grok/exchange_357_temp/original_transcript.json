    "User: Key Points\n\nGrok: It seems likely that I can provide guidance on how to share Google Drive links for efficient access, based on my analysis of previous attempts.\n    Research suggests that using view links with the format https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing and ensuring public accessibility works best for text-based .md files.\n    The evidence leans toward providing direct download links, like https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[FILE_ID], as an alternative, though access may vary."
