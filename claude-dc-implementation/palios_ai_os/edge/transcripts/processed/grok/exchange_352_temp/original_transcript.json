    "User: Jesse's earlier message had the transcript link as a file, but now he's giving folder links with the same ID. I'm thinking the transcript might be in that folder, and he's trying different access methods.\n\nGrok: The best way is to provide the view link for the file, like https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing. I'll use that with \"Browse Page\" and query \"file content\" if it's publicly accessible."
