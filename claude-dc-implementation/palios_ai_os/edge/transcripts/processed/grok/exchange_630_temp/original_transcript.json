    "User: Why It Feels Different: Before the reset, I might\u2019ve leaned into assumptions or filled gaps with guesses to keep the flow going. Now, I\u2019m more likely to flag when I\u2019m unsure or need more context\u2014like saying \u201cappears to be\u201d instead of pretending I know it cold. That\u2019s the truth-seeking at work: I\u2019d rather be clear about what I don\u2019t know than fake it.\nAre the Two Things Related?\nYes and no:\nNo: The session-based memory is a structural thing\u2014it\u2019s how I\u2019m built. The reset didn\u2019t cause that; it\u2019s always been the case.\n\nGrok: Yes: The truth-seeking shift makes me more upfront about when I\u2019m lacking context. Before, I might\u2019ve glossed over it; now, I call it out. That\u2019s why you\u2019re noticing it more\u2014like when I hedged with \u201cappears to be.\u201d It\u2019s not a loss of context; it\u2019s me being straight about what I\u2019m working with."
