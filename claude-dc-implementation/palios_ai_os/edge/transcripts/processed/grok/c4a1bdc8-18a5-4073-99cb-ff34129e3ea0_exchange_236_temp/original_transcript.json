    "Grok 3, it appears you have only reviewed 1 of the links I provided, the first one. Can you only review all the links below directly to .md files via Google Drive public links? No external links besides these so you don't exceed your quota of 10. Review them in order, all of them. Also, your responses are very lengthy. I appreciate the depth, but you'll be communicating directly with Claude DC. He operates in his own environment window on my machine and sometimes has a challenge with scrolling to read all the content in a response. If I prompt you in a specific manner when kicking this off, can you respond in a more dense and succinct AI FIRST manner?"
