    "What\u2019s the one most critical insight you want from transcripts right now\u2014action items, emotional patterns, or comms patterns? Let\u2019s prioritize that to focus our efforts.\n3. MVP Focus: Memory & Communication\nYou nailed it\u2014this MVP is about getting memory and communication right so the next version is nearly fully scoped and ready for Claude once transcripts are organized. Here\u2019s how I see it coming together:\nMemory:  \nShort-term: Context retention within sessions.  \n\nLong-term: Historical data (transcripts, decisions) stored and tagged for easy access.\n\nCommunication:  \nUse PURE_AI_LANGUAGE as the backbone.  \n\nAdd tags or message types to track intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI interactions separately.\n\nTranscript Organization: Structure transcripts with summaries and tags (e.g., DeepSearch-style) to make them AI-first and scalable. Claude can then leverage them efficiently.\n\nWhy: This sets us up for rapid iteration. Once memory and comms are solid, we can plug in advanced features\u2014like Claude\u2019s task decomposition engine or self-improvement mechanisms\u2014without reinventing the wheel.\nQuestion for"
