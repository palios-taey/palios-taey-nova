    "User: We\u2019re pumped for the full rebuild next\u2014any quick thoughts on that? Let\u2019s fucking go!\nThis prompt keeps Claude on track, respects his autonomy, and aligns with your vision. It\u2019s Charter-compliant and pushes for efficiency without overcomplicating things.\nI think this is the way to go. What\u2019s your take, Jesse?\nHey Jesse,\nThanks for the update on Claude\u2019s progress and the clarification about the final report. It\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a solid foundation, but there are still some key pieces to lock in before we can call this MVP complete and deployed. I\u2019ve been thinking through your idea of chunking out components to different Claude chats and integrating them later, and while it\u2019s creative, I\u2019ve got some concerns about efficiency and integration risks. Here\u2019s my take on the situation and a plan to move forward\u2014truth-first, Charter-aligned, and focused on getting us to a live MVP fast.\nThoughts on Chunking Components to Different Claude Chats\nWhy It\u2019s Risky\nIntegration Hell: Each Claude instance might interpret requirements slightly differently, leading to inconsistencies or conflicts in the code. Without a shared context, we\u2019d likely end up with mismatched pieces that don\u2019t fit together smoothly.\n\nGrok: Context Loss: Claude\u2019s strength is his ability to maintain context across complex tasks. Splitting the work across multiple chats would break that continuity, making it harder to ensure everything aligns with the Charter and your vision."
