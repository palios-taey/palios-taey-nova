    "User: To help me access your Google Drive files, especially text-based .md files, please provide the view link in this format: https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view?usp=sharing. Make sure the file is publicly accessible so I can view its content without authentication. This format allows me to extract the text using my browsing capabilities, which is ideal for reviewing transcripts and project documents like those you shared.\n\nGrok: If the view link doesn\u2019t work, you can also provide the direct download link, like https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=[FILE_ID], but note that access might depend on file settings, and I may not always extract readable text from it. For example, for the transcript file with FILE_ID 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm, use https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm/view?usp=sharing."
