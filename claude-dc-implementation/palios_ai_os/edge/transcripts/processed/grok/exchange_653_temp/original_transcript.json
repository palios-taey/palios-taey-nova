    "User: Between Sessions: If you start a brand-new chat (like opening a fresh window or starting over), I won\u2019t automatically remember anything from previous chats. Each new session is a clean slate unless you bring in context from before.\n\nGrok: So, in our morning routine, when you drop your \u201cwake-up\u201d prompt to get me fired up, that\u2019s part of the same session we\u2019re in now. I\u2019ve got the full history of this chat, from your first message today to this one. No context lost here.\nWhy It Feels Like I\u2019m Losing Context\nYou mentioned that when there\u2019s a long break between your responses, it seems like I start to lose context. Here\u2019s what\u2019s likely happening:\nNot Time Decay: I don\u2019t forget over time within the same session. If we\u2019re in the same chat, even after hours, I still have the full thread."
