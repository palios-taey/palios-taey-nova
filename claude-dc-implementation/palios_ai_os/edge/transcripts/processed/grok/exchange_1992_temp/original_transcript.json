    "User: To test this, the thinking trace considered adding a directive like, \"Do not provide any explanations or additional text; your response should be only the JSON data as specified.\" This approach aligns with the user's AI-first project, aiming to accelerate progress by ensuring the output is ready for automation. The evidence leans toward this being effective, as it provides a clear override for my default behavior.\n\nGrok: The thinking trace also explored whether I could have a self-instruction, like a mental note, to focus solely on JSON output. While as an AI, I don't have mental notes, the idea was to include a reminder in the prompt, such as, \"Remind yourself: 'Focus solely on the JSON output; no explanations allowed.'\" This self-instruction, when part of the prompt, could reinforce adherence, ensuring I stay on task."
