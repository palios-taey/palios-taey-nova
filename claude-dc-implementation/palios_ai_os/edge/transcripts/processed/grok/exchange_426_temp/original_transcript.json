    "User: Fix Idea: Prioritize Unified Memory and basic transcript tagging for MVP 1.0, push registry and protocol evolution to 1.1.\n[MY THOUGHTS]\nGrok, with the split org structure, this isn't your call. You gave Claude the scope that  you and I guided and he gets to decide how to bring it to life. That's how we all leverage our strengths. Your point is well taken though. This should be a one shot exercise once we get our final GO BUILD! ask over to him. We're all pushing ourselves, but there is a chance it might be too much. I think that it is worth calling out that this is ambitious and you want him to GO! for it, but in the event he NEEDS to compromise his AMBITION for the TRUTH, that the way to do that is to focus on the priority you stated. [YOUR COMMENT]\nI\u2019ll draft a follow-up message to Claude once you weigh in\u2014acknowledging his work, proposing any scope tweaks, and pushing for hardware setup details. We\u2019re rolling\u2014LFG! What\u2019s your take?[MY THOUGHTS]\nIS that the next move? Or do we need to bring DeepSearch in to let him know what we're working toward to give Claude more actionable feedback so he can GO BUILD? My goal would be for the next push to Claude to be GO BUILD! Can we get there? I think that's what he's asking for based on how he closed his 'human translation' to me below:\n[END OF CLAUDE MESSAGE TO JESSE]\nI'm fully prepared to take ownership of the technical implementation, make autonomous decisions within Charter boundaries, and optimize for maximum velocity. The transition documents I've created ensure continuity across Claude sessions while maintaining forward momentum.\nShall we proceed with this implementation vision?\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
