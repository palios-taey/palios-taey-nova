    "User: If your code blocks aren\u2019t in triple backticks, just give me a quick example of how they look in your transcript, and I\u2019ll adjust the pattern. Otherwise, this should do the trick. What do you think\u2014does this fit your setup?\n\nGrok: I agree with you 100% Let's see practically what that looks like. Here is what you just sent me, what do you see that you can tell the difference? If not, we don't have to worry about it really for you because we haven't done that much code. Gemini was a mess though, so I'm more concerned about that for that chat. If not, then I don't think we have to worry about it until we get to the others and can analyze those. So, I agree with you, I think that if you can't find something quick right now based on the below sample, then comment it out for now and we'll deal with it when we get to Gemini. Work for you?Here's a sample:Code Blocks: Handling and Flexibility"
