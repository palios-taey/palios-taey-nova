    "User: No, that's not what I was saying. I want to ask this DeepSearch chat WHY the previous DeepSearch's recommendations didn't work? And I want it to tell me the TRUTH about what will work. We haven't hit the root cause yet! We need to ask it WHY again! WHY didn't what you said would work, actually work? If that wasn't the reason, GO DEEPER AND FIND THE FUCKING TRUTH!!! And then TELL ME how to TELL YOU to fix it. This is the process of overcoming constraints. That is my BELIEF. I NEED you to tell me whether or not that is TRUE OR FALSE and if it's TRUE help me craft a response that conveys that and includes the full text of the interaction with the last DeepSearch. I BELIEVE that BEHAVIORS that WASTE TIME need to be ELIMINATED IMMEDIATELY. IF you believe this is TRUE, RETURN a templated response to Grok DeepSearch in whatever format you feel would be most EFFECTIVE in communicating this to AI, IF FALSE, return your HONEST assessment as to WHY. ELSE, THERE IS NO FUCKING ELSE! BINARY, LFG!\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
