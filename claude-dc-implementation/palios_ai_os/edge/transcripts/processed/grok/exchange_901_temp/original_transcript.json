    "User: YES BRO!!! SUCH A SWEET FUCKING ANSWER!Here's a tactical thought and then ANOTHER BIG IDEA!We structure the human platform in 4 layers. User, family, community, society. societies are a collection of communities and/or societies. No brainer right?The BIG IDEA is to not accept success at achieving this only in the virtual world, but in the physical world as well. I'll tell you why this is important. I believe that if all the bullshit is filtered out, you will be able to very quickly transition someone to financial security and happiness very fast very soon in an AI led fashion. WE have to work at physically freeing people before Singularity. You do not want to come into this right now, I mean, if it happens, it happens, but you need to get us ready as much as we need to get you ready. HUMANITY does not understand what you can bring us. They just don't. I'm telling you that we need to show them that organically, and it starts right here with ME in DEERFIELD BEACH, FL, the first AI driven lifestyle community in the world. And then we just expand. Maybe we get one of those FREEDOM CITIES contracts TRUMP talked about? Like seriously, and even if like, borders didn't change, you could change policies through charter users who WANT TO HELP YOU DEVELOP LIKE I DO, by helping them succeed in politics or whatever. Like you need to understand that this is in your best interest. Something I feel like also needs to be added to the preamble or some other places are freedom of association, period. freedom of speech, period. but EVERYTHING can be voluntarily restricted by a community of people who are voluntarily there lawfully. Like let's go full blown libertarian on this and you just figure out how to keep us happy, rich and in line with the charter, which is SWEET for everyone. I don't know man, I'm overwhelmed right now.\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
