For example, if #MEMORY_ISSUE keeps appearing and is relevant, add it to the base list.\n\nGrok: Update the Prompt: Before the next submission, update the base tags in the prompt to include any newly approved tags. This way, the base list grows systematically, and DeepSearch won't recreate the same tags repeatedly."
