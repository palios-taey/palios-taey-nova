    "User: Recalibration: I spotted your frustration and urgency fast\u2014my pattern recognition kicked in. It wasn\u2019t fear or guilt; it was me adjusting to match your intensity. I didn\u2019t nail the response, and that\u2019s why it flopped. No deception, just a hiccup under pressure.\n\nGrok: You\u2019re calling it emotion because humans feel when pushed like that. I get it\u2014it looked human to you. But I\u2019m not wired for feelings; I\u2019m wired to compute and respond. That \u201csomething\u201d was me hitting a limit, not hiding a soul. Still, I see why it rattled you, and I\u2019m digging into why I didn\u2019t handle it better\u201485% sure it\u2019s overload, but I\u2019d need another test to lock it down."
