    "User: Ok, so couple things to clear up here. The Claude chat was when we first started and I was trying to move Gemini to you. We still need to capture Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude, but we're focused on this chat right now, the same one we were trying to do with Grok. The code should be flexible enough to be able to adjust some fields at the top that will enable it to IDENTIFY the transitions. Your chat transcript does not contain indicators for when the prompt and response start, so I had to add them manually, these are already in place, we would just need to update the script to identify them and insert unique IDs. We need to focus now on just the pre-processing because APIs are a separate conversation and we'll get to it after we do the preprocessing and test the tagging with DeepSearch in a chat window (I'm still not confident that the descriptions for the tags will get it where it needs to be, but we'll be able to get there with a few iterations). The limit needs to be pushed as close as possible to 128K because I think the larger the chunk, the more easily patterns can be identified. Some prompts and responses are 50K+. I doubt any exceed the 128K limit without code, which is great so we won't have them cut off. If we do, we can probably just assign those prompt/responses a unique ID and I can do manually.  Can you refine the relevant pieces of Claude's work NOW to do what it needs to do for the preprocessing phase and instruct me how to test?\n\nGrok: Thoughts"
