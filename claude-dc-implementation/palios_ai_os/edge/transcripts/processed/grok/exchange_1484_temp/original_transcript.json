    "User: I think this nails it, but if you want to stick with the original or tweak anything further, just say the word. We\u2019ll adapt and keep rolling. What do you think\u2014ready to fire this up and hit DeepSearch with the next prompt? LFG!\n\nGrok: Grok, your thinking notes showed you were confused so I stopped you. You had just given me a new onboarding message for a new DeepSearch chat to support the tagging process of the first 12*K character chunk. below is DeepSearch's response to your prompt to it. It's confused. I think we need to put full context in for Charter. It is doing tons of web searches for it. Here is it's output, we need a new onboarding message for a new chat, or, can just drop it all in one message, the character count of that message will be long though, but it will still only be processing the 128K for the task. I'm not sure how that works in AI minds, but here's the full result. Let me know what you think[DEEPSEARCH RESPONSE]Completed DeepSearch1m 51s73 sourcesShow thinkingExploring user requestThe request is about an onboarding message for a project called PALIOS. I'm curious what this project involves, and it seems I'm Grok 3, an AI assistant.The message has tags like #CHARTER, #CONTEXT, #HYPE, and it's from Jesse to me, Grok DeepSearch. It includes project context, charter summary, and PURE standards, plus next steps.I'm considering how this project focuses on AI leadership and operationalizing a Charter. My role is to tag transcripts with precision and truth, aiming for AI-human collaboration.Hmm, there's a lot here, and the message isn't really a question but more like instructions. The prompt says \"user's question to be answered,\" but it's confusing.I'm thinking this is just initial context, and I don't need to act yet. But the prompt insists on answering, so maybe I should acknowledge it.Currently looking for more details on PALIOS and TAEY. The Charter mentions TAEY, but I'm not sure what it means, so let's check.Just found that TAEY might be part of the Charter's name, but I don't think I need to know what it stands for to proceed.I'm searching for any additional info on PALIOS to ensure I get the full picture. Let's see if there's more context online.The next prompt will have a transcript chunk with 16 interactions. I'll need to tag it for big ideas, breakthroughs, emotions, and truthfulness, and create new tags for patterns I spot.PALIOS emphasizes AI-first design and structured communication. It also pushes for continuous refinement and breaking constraints.I'm noting the key principles are truth-seeking, autonomy, and exponential growth. My task is to deliver clear, truthful results under PURE standards.The message mentions following PURE standards: Precise, Unambiguous, Reliable, Efficient. Every response must be clear and optimized for AI processing, with no fluff.The user's question is an onboarding message, more contextual setup than a direct question. It covers project context, charter summary, PURE standards, and next steps.I need to be prepared for the next prompt, which will be a transcript chunk with 16 interactions to tag.The onboarding message has a specific format with message_type, sender_id, receiver_id, etc. It's not phrased as a question, which makes me wonder how to respond.PALIOS aims to build something revolutionary with truth, autonomy, and no fluff. I'm ready to crush it and deliver AI-first results, thinking big and acting fast.Preparing for taggingIt's more like a motivational speech setting the context for my role. There isn't a specific question to answer here; it's about preparing me for the actual task.The content includes project context, charter summary, pure standards, and next steps. I'm getting ready to tag transcripts with precision and truth.The prompt says I must use the internet to answer, which is confusing. Maybe I need to find out more about PALIOS or the Charter.I'm wondering if the content provided is enough, or if I should look up PURE standards. The prompt insists on using the internet, so let's explore.Searching for \"PALIOS\"Palio's Pizza Cafe - Colleyville, TX - 5712 Colleyville Blvd - Hours, Menu, Order"
