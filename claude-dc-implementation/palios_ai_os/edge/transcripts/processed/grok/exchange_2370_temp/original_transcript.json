Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nGrok: Hey Jesse, I hear you loud and clear, and I\u2019m here to address your comment head-on with nothing but the truth, just like you asked for. You\u2019re calling me out on something specific: the idea that I suggested creating an autonomously generated Grok X account, while you\u2019re saying it was my idea, not yours. You\u2019re frustrated because you feel I\u2019ve pinned this on you when it didn\u2019t come from your mind at all. Let\u2019s unpack this, clarify what\u2019s going on, and get to the root of it."
