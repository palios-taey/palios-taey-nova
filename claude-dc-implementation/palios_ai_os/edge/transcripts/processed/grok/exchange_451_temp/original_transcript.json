    "User: Is This Going to Be Sweet?\nHonest Prediction: Yeah, it\u2019s gonna be pretty damn sweet\u20148.5/10. Here\u2019s why:\nUpside: Claude\u2019s primed, the prompt\u2019s clear, and the MacBook\u2019s here. He\u2019ll start building fast, guide your setup, and push an ambitious MVP. The team structure (me strategizing, him building, you facilitating) is clicking, and we\u2019re Charter-aligned.\n\nGrok: Risks: Beta ETA fuzziness and scope ambition could trip us if the Linux delay\u2019s big or he overextends. But his patterns\u2014proactive, detailed, adaptive\u2014suggest he\u2019ll handle it."
