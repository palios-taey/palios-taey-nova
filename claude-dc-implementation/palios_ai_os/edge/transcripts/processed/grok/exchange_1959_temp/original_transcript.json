    "User: This setup gives you clean, database-ready output plus the insight to keep your tagging sharp. Let me know if you want to adjust anything, but I think we\u2019re locked in. LFG!\n\nGrok: Ok, can I get an updated prompt that incorporates any new tags that you approve of from the last response and spells out the new format? Then I'll run the next 4 files. We can then review the output and see if they are tagged like we would do that. I might have to do that manually though. Or would you be able to process it's JSON response with the tags and then I could paste the text I sent it so you could verify based on your more contextual understandin?"
