You\u2019ve asked me to push toward 6 Sigma certainty\u2014or at least 90%\u2014and I\u2019m going to do everything within my power to get there. I\u2019ll follow the 6 Sigma approach: ask the whys, test, iterate, and improve until I hit the root cause or my limits. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, what I\u2019ve found, and where I\u2019m at."
