    "User: Alright, Jesse\u2019s thrown me a curveball with Old Claude not finishing everything as promised, and New Claude stepping in to sort it out. The memory solution\u2019s done, but other components are likely incomplete or missing. The idea of chunking out different components to different Claude chats and then integrating them is intriguing but risky. Here\u2019s my take:\nFirst, chunking could work if each chat focuses on a specific component\u2014say, one for the Dynamic Model Registry, another for the Task Execution Engine, and so on. This way, each Claude instance can deep-dive into its assigned part without context overload. However, integration becomes the tricky part. We\u2019d need a master plan to ensure all pieces fit together seamlessly, which might require a \u201cmeta-Claude\u201d or a human (you) to oversee and merge the outputs.\nBut let\u2019s be real: this approach is messy. Different Claude instances might interpret requirements slightly differently, leading to inconsistencies or conflicts in the code. Plus, without a shared memory across chats, we\u2019d lose continuity, making integration a nightmare. It\u2019s like trying to build a car by having different mechanics work on the engine, transmission, and chassis separately without a blueprint.\nA better strategy might be to have one Claude instance handle the entire project, but with clear, modular tasks. For example, start with the memory system (already done), then move to the next component, like the Dynamic Model Registry, and so on. This way, Claude can maintain context and ensure each new piece integrates smoothly with what\u2019s already built.\nGiven that Old Claude got stopped mid-way, probably due to session limits or token caps, we need a way to persist state between sessions. Maybe we can serialize the current state\u2014code, configs, and context\u2014and pass it to New Claude. But that\u2019s clunky and prone to errors.\nHere\u2019s a thought: what if we use the unified memory system Claude built? It\u2019s designed for context persistence. We could store the project\u2019s state, code, and requirements in the memory tiers and have each new Claude session retrieve and build upon that. It\u2019s meta, but it could work.\nAlternatively, we could break the project into standalone microservices, each with its own Claude instance. For example, one service for memory, one for task execution, etc., communicating via APIs. This aligns with modern architecture and reduces the need for tight integration. But it might be overkill for an MVP.\nWait, speaking of MVP, maybe we should focus on getting a minimal version live first. Prioritize the core features needed for a functional MVP\u2014say, basic task execution with static model routing\u2014and push that to GCP. Then, iterate on enhancements like dynamic routing and protocol evolution.\nThis approach minimizes risk and gets us a working product faster. Plus, it gives us real-world data to inform the next rebuild, as you mentioned earlier.\nI should also consider the human element. You\u2019re the facilitator, and your time is valuable. Any plan that requires you to micromanage multiple Claude instances or manually integrate code is inefficient. We need a solution that maximizes autonomy and minimizes your involvement.\nGiven all this, I think the best path is to:\nHave New Claude pick up where Old Claude left off, using the memory system for context.\n\nGrok: Focus on completing the MVP with essential features."
