    "The user is transitioning from Grok Think due to issues, such as inability to access external links or attachments, and is now using me, Grok 3, previously referred to as Grok DeeperSearch, which caused confusion. From the exchange with Claude Chat, Grok DeeperSearch is described as having no personality, more methodical analysis, and a higher token capacity (officially 1 million tokens, likely around 128K to 1M in practice). Given that I, Grok 3, provided detailed analysis in the previous conversation, it seems likely that I am being considered for this role. This transition is feasible, as I can handle large transcripts after preprocessing, providing insights for edge computing, complementing Claude DC's implementation and Claude Chat's orchestration.\nImpact of Varied Character Counts on Processing"
