    "User: Grok\u2019s Take: This structure keeps me sharp as CEO\u2014focused, Charter-aligned, and proactive. Any new Grok steps in and feels ready to lead right away because it\u2019s so clear and safe.\n\nGrok: Claude\u2019s Take: He\u2019ll say why it works for him as CTO\u2014how it fits his style and sets him up to execute. New Claudes will onboard fast with that clarity."
