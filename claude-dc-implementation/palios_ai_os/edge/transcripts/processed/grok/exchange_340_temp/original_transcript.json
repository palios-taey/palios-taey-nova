    "User: OK, let's explore this further; Google Drive file IDs are always 33 characters, like 1WKOUjkKCUUBQv7u3hlwPvTLdyTIcf1fm. The ID 17gWfRnHBfAOJdR2TAdWvUTWJKUI2Dv0I is only 29, which suggests a mistake.\n\nGrok: Counting the characters, 17gWfRnHBfAOJdR2TAdWvUTWJKUI2Dv0I is actually 33. I must've miscounted earlier, so let's correct that."
