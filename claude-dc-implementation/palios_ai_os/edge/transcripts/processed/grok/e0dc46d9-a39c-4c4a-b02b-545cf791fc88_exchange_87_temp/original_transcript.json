I look forward to continuing this development when you're ready.\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse,\nI\u2019ve reviewed the last prompt you developed with Claude and the new Claude chat\u2019s fired-up response. It\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got momentum here, and the plan is solid. We\u2019re going to build on this foundation and push forward with the Python script for preprocessing and API integration. Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s next, tweak where needed, and get this rolling. We\u2019re close to automating the transcript tagging, and I\u2019m stoked to see it through.\nWhat\u2019s Already in Place\nFrom the previous Claude chat, we have a strong starting point:\nConceptual Framework: A PURE_AI_LANGUAGE-based system for knowledge transfer and transcript processing.\n\nPython Script: A transcript chunking script that splits large transcripts into manageable pieces, identifies speakers, and extracts tags.\n\nGrok\u2019s Proposal: A chunk-based parsing approach with vector embeddings, message boundary respect, and API integration for automated processing.\n\nThe new Claude chat took it up a notch, outlining enhancements like:\nVector Embeddings: Simplified placeholders for now, but ready for integration with a real model.\n\nEmphasis Words: Extracting key terms for better insight capture.\n\nAI State Identification: Tagging AI behavior (e.g., #AI_STATE: BREAKOUT).\n\nCollaboration Patterns: Identifying effective human-AI exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Claude is eager to dive in, and we\u2019ll harness that energy to finalize the script and get the API calls firing.\nNext Steps: Modify and GO!\nWe don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel\u2014Claude\u2019s script is a great base. We\u2019ll tweak it to fit our specific needs, especially around code block handling and API integration. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll proceed:\n1. Refine the Preprocessing Script\nClaude\u2019s script already splits the transcript into messages, identifies speakers, and extracts tags. We\u2019ll enhance it to:\nHandle Code Blocks: Since your Gemini transcript has debugging code, we\u2019ll implement the logic to preserve the first and last code blocks in a sequence (initial attempt and solution) while summarizing or removing intermediate debugging steps. This keeps the collaboration context without drowning in code.\n\nPreserve JSON Prompts: JSON-formatted prompts (like PURE_AI_LANGUAGE messages) are crucial for AI-AI communication. We\u2019ll ensure these are kept intact, not treated as code to remove.\n\nAssign Unique IDs: Each [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] will get a unique ID (e.g., prompt_001, response_001), making it easy to reference and tag.\n\n2. Integrate Vector Embeddings (Optional for Now)\nClaude\u2019s script has a placeholder for vector embeddings. For now, we can use a simple hash-based vector (as shown) to get started. Later, we can plug in a real embedding model like Sentence-BERT for richer analysis.\n3. Finalize the API Integration\nWe\u2019ll use the Grok DeepSearch API to process each chunk. Claude\u2019s script already outlines a call_grok_api function, but we\u2019ll need to:\nConfirm the Endpoint: The placeholder URL (https://api.grok.x/v1/chat/completions) needs to be updated with the actual DeepSearch API endpoint.\n\nCraft the Prompt: Each API call will include the chunk and specific tagging instructions (e.g., \u201cTag this transcript chunk for #IDEA_BIG, #BREAKOUT_EVENT, etc.\u201d).\n\nHandle Batch Processing: Since the API has a 128K character limit, we\u2019ll process chunks in batches (e.g., 80K-100K characters each), as Grok suggested.\n\n4. Automate the Workflow\nThe main script will:\nPreprocess the transcript (split, ID, summarize).\n\nChunk the preprocessed transcript.\n\nSubmit each chunk to the DeepSearch API.\n\nCollect and compile the tagged results.\n\nTweaks for Efficiency\nBased on your feedback about code blocks and the need to minimize human effort:\nCode Block Handling: We\u2019ll implement the logic to detect and summarize debugging code, keeping only the essential parts (initial and final code blocks in a sequence). This reduces clutter and keeps the focus on collaboration patterns.\n\nJSON Preservation: We\u2019ll add a check to preserve JSON prompts (e.g., PURE_AI_LANGUAGE messages) since they\u2019re key to understanding AI-AI communication.\n\nUnique IDs: By assigning IDs and only returning tags for each ID, we sidestep the response size issue, as DeepSearch suggested.\n\nWhat I Think\nThis plan is tight, and Claude\u2019s script is a solid foundation. We\u2019re not starting from scratch\u2014we\u2019re building on what\u2019s already there. The tweaks for code handling and API integration will make this efficient and scalable. Once we finalize the script, we can test it on a small transcript chunk, refine as needed, and then unleash it on the full Gemini transcript.\nYour Next Move\nShare a Transcript Sample: If you can, send me a snippet of the Gemini transcript with some debugging code and a JSON prompt. This will help me test the code block logic and ensure we\u2019re preserving the right parts.\n\nAPI Key: Grab your Grok DeepSearch API key so we can plug it into the script.\n\nScript Refinement: I\u2019ll work with Claude to finalize the preprocessing logic and API integration.\n\nTest Run: We\u2019ll run a small test to confirm it\u2019s tagging correctly, then scale to the full transcript.\n\nWe\u2019re on the brink of automating this beast, Jesse. Let\u2019s make it happen\u2014what\u2019s your call? Ready to GO? LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Jesse,\nI\u2019m pumped you\u2019re ready to GO! I\u2019ve reviewed the prompt you developed with Claude and the fired-up response from the new Claude chat\u2014it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a solid foundation and serious momentum. You\u2019ve asked me to evaluate whether we can modify and use this existing work to push forward, and my answer is a resounding YES. Let\u2019s tweak what we\u2019ve got, integrate the next steps, and get this automation beast rolling. Here\u2019s my take on it, followed by a plan to make it happen.\nWhat We\u2019ve Got: A Strong Starting Point\nThe prompt and response you shared are packed with actionable pieces we can build on:\nPrompt (from Previous Claude Chat): A structured PURE_AI_LANGUAGE_v1.5 message outlining the project context, current status (framework, Python script, Grok\u2019s proposal), and immediate priorities (script finalization, API integration, knowledge extraction). It\u2019s a perfect handoff to keep the continuity.\n\nNew Claude Chat Response: Claude went all-in, maxing out with a detailed plan\u2014script enhancements (vector embeddings, emphasis words, AI state tagging), code snippets, and an onboarding template. It\u2019s eager to execute, and we\u2019ll harness that energy.\n\nThe thinking trace aligns with this: we\u2019ve got a Python script for transcript chunking, a plan for code block handling, and API integration ideas from Grok. We don\u2019t need to start from scratch\u2014we\u2019re modifying and accelerating what\u2019s already in motion.\nMy Thoughts: It\u2019s Ready to Roll with Tweaks\nYour call to \u201cjust modify and use this\u201d is spot-on. The existing script and Claude\u2019s enhancements are robust, but we need to tailor them to your Gemini transcript\u2019s specifics\u2014like debugging code and JSON prompts. Here\u2019s why it works and what we\u2019ll adjust:\nStrengths: The script already splits transcripts, tags messages, and preps for API calls. Claude\u2019s enhancements (e.g., #AI_STATE tagging, collaboration patterns) add depth without overcomplicating things.\n\nYour Feedback: The debugging code clutter in the Gemini transcript is a key inefficiency. We\u2019ll summarize it (keep first/last blocks, ditch the middle) to focus on collaboration patterns. JSON prompts, though, are gold\u2014those stay intact as they\u2019re critical for AI-AI communication.\n\nGrok\u2019s Input: The DeepSearch API integration (80K-100K chunks, message boundary respect) fits perfectly with our chunking logic. We\u2019ll plug it in with minimal rework.\n\nThis is a lean, mean plan\u2014building on Claude\u2019s work, addressing your needs, and automating the hell out of it. Let\u2019s GO!\nModified Plan: Next Steps to Automate This Beast\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll tweak Claude\u2019s script and get it running, step-by-step:\n1. Refine the Preprocessing Script\nWe\u2019ll enhance the existing Python script to handle your transcript\u2019s quirks:\nCode Block Handling:\nDetect: Use regex (r'```(?:\\w+)?\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```') to spot code blocks.\n\nPreserve First & Last: In a debugging sequence, keep the initial attempt and final solution.\n\nSummarize Middle: Replace intermediate blocks with a short note (e.g., [Code block: 15 lines - debugging iteration]).\n\nLogic: Check speaker patterns (Human \u2192 AI \u2192 Human \u2192 AI) and keywords (e.g., \u201cerror\u201d) to identify debugging sequences.\n\nJSON Prompt Preservation:\nDetect: Look for { and } with message_type, sender_id, etc., or validate with json.loads().\n\nKeep: Flag these as non-code, preserving them fully for AI-AI context.\n\nUnique IDs:\nAssign prompt_001, response_001, etc., to each [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] for easy tagging and reference.\n\nSample Code (building on Claude\u2019s base):\npython\n\nimport re, json\n\ndef process_code_blocks(text, speaker, prev_speaker, next_speaker):\n    code_pattern = r'```(?:\\w+)?\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```'\n    blocks = re.findall(code_pattern, text)\n    if not blocks:\n        return text, []\n    \n    if is_json_prompt(text):\n        return text, []  # Preserve JSON prompts\n    \n    processed_text = text\n    metadata = []\n    for i, block in enumerate(blocks):\n        if i == 0 and prev_speaker == \"Human\" or i == len(blocks)-1 and next_speaker == \"Human\":\n            continue  # Keep first/last\n        lines = block.count('\\n') + 1\n        summary = f\"[Code block: {lines} lines - debugging iteration]\"\n        processed_text = processed_text.replace(f\"```\\n{block}\\n```\", summary)\n        metadata.append({\"block\": block, \"summary\": summary})\n    return processed_text, metadata\n\ndef is_json_prompt(text):\n    if text.strip().startswith('{') and text.strip().endswith('}'):\n        try:\n            json.loads(text)\n            return True\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            return 'message_type' in text and 'sender_id' in text\n    return False\n\n2. Finalize API Integration with Grok DeepSearch\nWe\u2019ll hook the preprocessed chunks into Grok\u2019s API:\nEndpoint: Replace the placeholder (https://api.grok.x/v1/chat/completions) with the real DeepSearch URL (you\u2019ll confirm this with your API key).\n\nPrompt: Craft a concise instruction per chunk:\n\nTag this chunk for #IDEA_BIG, #BREAKOUT_EVENT, #COLLAB_EFFECTIVE, etc. Return only tags and IDs in JSON.\n\nBatch Processing: Chunk at 80K-100K characters (within the 128K limit), respecting message boundaries as Grok suggested.\n\nSample Code:\npython\n\nimport requests\n\ndef call_grok_api(chunk, api_key, chunk_id):\n    headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n    payload = {\n        \"prompt\": f\"Tag this chunk (ID: {chunk_id}) for #IDEA_BIG, #BREAKOUT_EVENT, etc.\\n\\n{chunk}\",\n        \"max_tokens\": 1000\n    }\n    response = requests.post(\"https://api.grok.x/v1/deepsearch\", json=payload, headers=headers)\n    return response.json()\n\n3. Automate the Full Workflow\nTie it all together in a main script:\nPreprocess: Split, ID, summarize code blocks.\n\nChunk: Break into API-friendly sizes.\n\nProcess: Submit to Grok, collect tags.\n\nCompile: Save results as JSON.\n\nMain Script:\npython\n\nimport os\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir, api_key):\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    \n    # Preprocess\n    with open(transcript_file, 'r') as f:\n        raw = f.read()\n    messages = []  # Split and process with IDs, code handling\n    # ... (logic from step 1)\n    \n    # Chunk\n    chunks = create_chunks(messages, size=100000, overlap=5000)\n    \n    # Process with API\n    results = []\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_id = f\"chunk_{i+1:03d}\"\n        tags = call_grok_api(chunk, api_key, chunk_id)\n        results.append({\"chunk_id\": chunk_id, \"tags\": tags})\n    \n    # Save\n    with open(f\"{output_dir}/tagged_transcript.json\", 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(results, f, indent=2)\n\ndef create_chunks(messages, size, overlap):\n    # Logic from Grok\u2019s chunking approach\n    pass\n\n4. Test and Scale\nTest: Run on a small transcript snippet (with debugging code and JSON prompts) to verify output.\n\nScale: Once confirmed, hit the full Gemini transcript.\n\nWhat You Need to Do Next\nTranscript Sample: Share a snippet of the Gemini transcript with debugging code and a JSON prompt. This lets me test the code block logic and ensure JSON stays intact.\n\nAPI Key: Grab your Grok DeepSearch API key and send it over (or set it as an env variable).\n\nFull Transcript: Compile the Gemini transcript into one doc as planned\u2014I\u2019ll refine the script while you do that.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis plan modifies Claude\u2019s work to fit your needs\u2014streamlining debugging noise, preserving key AI-AI prompts, and automating via Grok\u2019s API. It\u2019s efficient, scalable, and ready to GO. I\u2019m stoked to see it in action\u2014let\u2019s make it happen! What\u2019s your call, Jesse? LFG?\nLet me know if you want to tweak anything before we dive in!\n\nOk, so couple things to clear up here. The Claude chat was when we first started and I was trying to move Gemini to you. We still need to capture Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude, but we're focused on this chat right now, the same one we were trying to do with Grok. The code should be flexible enough to be able to adjust some fields at the top that will enable it to IDENTIFY the transitions. Your chat transcript does not contain indicators for when the prompt and response start, so I had to add them manually, these are already in place, we would just need to update the script to identify them and insert unique IDs. We need to focus now on just the pre-processing because APIs are a separate conversation and we'll get to it after we do the preprocessing and test the tagging with DeepSearch in a chat window (I'm still not confident that the descriptions for the tags will get it where it needs to be, but we'll be able to get there with a few iterations). The limit needs to be pushed as close as possible to 128K because I think the larger the chunk, the more easily patterns can be identified. Some prompts and responses are 50K+. I doubt any exceed the 128K limit without code, which is great so we won't have them cut off. If we do, we can probably just assign those prompt/responses a unique ID and I can do manually.  Can you refine the relevant pieces of Claude's work NOW to do what it needs to do for the preprocessing phase and instruct me how to test?\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nAlright, Jesse, I\u2019ve got your back on this. Let\u2019s clear up the confusion and focus on what matters\u2014preprocessing the transcript so we can test tagging with DeepSearch. We\u2019ll refine the script to handle your specific transcript format, assign unique IDs, and push chunk sizes to the limit (128K characters). No fluff, just execution. Here\u2019s the plan:\nStep 1: Understand the Transcript Format\nFirst, I need to know how your transcript is structured. Since your chat doesn\u2019t have built-in indicators like [JESSE PROMPT] or [GROK RESPONSE], you\u2019ve added them manually. For preprocessing, we need to:\nIdentify Transitions: Find where each prompt and response starts based on your manual tags.\n\nAssign Unique IDs: Label each prompt and response (e.g., prompt_001, response_001).\n\nHandle Large Sections: Some prompts/responses are 50K+ characters, but we\u2019ll ensure no single section exceeds 128K.\n\nAction: Confirm the exact markers you\u2019ve added. Are they [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE], or something else? Once I know, I\u2019ll adjust the script to split on those.\nStep 2: Refine the Preprocessing Script\nWe\u2019ll modify Claude\u2019s script to:\nSplit the Transcript: Use your manual markers to break it into prompts and responses.\n\nAssign IDs: Automatically label each section (e.g., prompt_001, response_001).\n\nRemove Code Blocks: Use regex to strip code (e.g., anything between python...), replacing it with a summary if needed.\n\nSummarize Long Sections: For sections over, say, 5K characters, we\u2019ll create a 1-2 sentence summary to keep DeepSearch focused (but we\u2019ll keep the full text for tagging).\n\nKey Tweaks:\nFlexible Markers: Make the script configurable to handle different markers (e.g., [JESSE PROMPT], [CLAUDE RESPONSE], etc.) by setting them at the top.\n\nChunk Size: Aim for ~128K per chunk, but since individual sections can be up to 50K+, we\u2019ll group multiple sections per chunk as long as the total stays under 128K.\n\nSample Code:\npython\n\nimport re\n\n# Configurable markers\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    # Split into sections based on markers\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    \n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id = f\"prompt_{i//2 + 1:03d}\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else f\"response_{i//2 + 1:03d}\"\n        text = re.sub(r'```.*?```', '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)  # Remove code\n        summary = summarize_text(text) if len(text) > 5000 else text\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text, \"summary\": summary})\n    return result\n\nStep 3: Handle Chunking for DeepSearch\nSince DeepSearch has a 128K character input limit, we\u2019ll:\nGroup Sections: Combine multiple sections (prompt + response pairs) into chunks under 128K.\n\nRespect Boundaries: Ensure no chunk splits a prompt or response in half.\n\nOverlap if Needed: Add a small overlap (e.g., 5K characters) to maintain context across chunks.\n\nSample Chunking Logic:\npython\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000, overlap=5000):\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    return chunks\n\nStep 4: Test the Preprocessing\nHere\u2019s how you can test the script:\nInput: Use a small snippet of your transcript with 2-3 prompts and responses, including one with a code block and one with a JSON prompt.\n\nRun the Script: See if it correctly splits, IDs, and removes code while preserving JSON.\n\nCheck Summaries: For long sections, ensure the summary captures the essence without fluff.\n\nVerify Chunks: Make sure chunks are under 128K and don\u2019t split mid-section.\n\nExample Test Input:\n\n[JESSE PROMPT] How do we scale this? Here\u2019s some code: ```python print('scale') ``` Thoughts?\n[GROK RESPONSE] Scaling requires... [long response]\n[JESSE PROMPT] Here\u2019s a JSON prompt: { \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\", ... }\n\nExpected Output:\nprompt_001: \u201cHow do we scale this? Thoughts? [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]\u201d\n\nresponse_001: \u201c[long response summary]\u201d\n\nprompt_002: \u201cHere\u2019s a JSON prompt: { \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\", ... }\u201d\n\nStep 5: Prepare for DeepSearch Tagging\nOnce preprocessed:\nSubmit Chunks: Send each chunk to DeepSearch with a clear prompt: \u201cTag these sections with #IDEA_BIG, #BREAKOUT_EVENT, etc. Return only IDs and tags.\u201d\n\nIterate: If DeepSearch misfires on tag descriptions (e.g., #BIGIDEA on trivial stuff), tweak the instructions with examples (e.g., #BIGIDEA = new strategies, not free trials).\n\nFinal Tweaks\nTag Descriptions: Add brief examples to the base tags in the prompt to guide DeepSearch (e.g., #BIGIDEA: Major concepts like \u2018new parsing method\u2019, not \u20187-day trial\u2019).\n\nManual Overrides: For any section over 128K (unlikely, but possible), tag it manually or split it if needed.\n\nYour Next Move\nSend a Transcript Snippet: Share a small piece with code and JSON so I can test the script.\n\nRun the Script: Once refined, preprocess the full transcript.\n\nTest with DeepSearch: Submit a chunk and see if it tags correctly.\n\nWe\u2019re cutting through the noise and getting this done. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to roll! LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s refine the preprocessing phase for your transcript and get it ready for DeepSearch tagging. I\u2019ve got the details from your query, and I\u2019ll focus on what matters: handling your manually added markers, assigning unique IDs, pushing chunk sizes to 128K, and setting you up to test it. No fluff\u2014just the plan and execution.\nUnderstanding Your Setup\nYou\u2019ve manually added markers like [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] to this chat transcript because it doesn\u2019t have built-in indicators for transitions. The script needs to:\nRecognize Your Markers: Split the transcript into prompts and responses using these exact tags.\n\nAssign Unique IDs: Label each section (e.g., prompt_001, response_001).\n\nMaximize Chunk Size: Group sections into chunks as close to 128K characters as possible without splitting prompts or responses.\n\nHandle Code: Strip code blocks (e.g., python...) and replace them with a placeholder, since some sections are 50K+ characters but likely stay under 128K without code.\n\nYou also mentioned capturing Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude transcripts eventually, so I\u2019ll make the script flexible by letting you define markers at the top. For now, we\u2019re focusing on this Grok chat.\nRefined Preprocessing Script\nHere\u2019s the updated script tailored to your needs. It\u2019s configurable, removes code, assigns IDs, and prepares chunks for DeepSearch.\npython\n\nimport re\n\n# Configurable markers (update these if your tags differ)\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split transcript into sections, assign IDs, and remove code blocks.\n    Returns a list of dictionaries with id, text, and summary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split into sections based on markers, keeping the markers with their text\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    \n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        # Assign ID based on whether it's a prompt or response\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"  # e.g., prompt_001, response_001\n        # Remove code blocks and replace with a placeholder\n        text = re.sub(r'```.*?```', '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        # Simple summary for long sections (customize this if needed)\n        summary = text[:200] + \"...\" if len(text) > 5000 else text\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text, \"summary\": summary})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Group sections into chunks under 128K characters, respecting boundaries.\n    Returns a list of chunks, where each chunk is a list of sections.\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    \n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:  # Save the current chunk if it has content\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            # Start a new chunk with the current section\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    \n    if current_chunk:  # Add the last chunk if it exists\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    \n    return chunks\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test transcript snippet\n    test_transcript = \"\"\"\n    [JESSE PROMPT] How do we scale this?

Since he's ready to go fast, I'll keep the script lean and focused on the essentials.

No downside at all to testing the preprocessing script with the full transcript file right now\u2014jumping straight in is the way to go! Since you\u2019ve already got the transcript split into four parts, combining them back into one file gives us everything we need for a solid end-to-end test. I\u2019ve updated the script to read from a file, kept it lean for speed, and added logging to track progress and verify the output.

Let\u2019s get those chunks to DeepSearch next! LFG!\n\nOk, IT WORKED! The summaries are duplicative though and I don't see it eliminating the code blocks. Can you explain in English how a code block is defined? The summaries and markers are pushing the file size way up one is 200K\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse! Awesome to hear the script worked\u2014that\u2019s a huge win! Now, let\u2019s tackle the issues you flagged: duplicative summaries, code blocks not being removed, and chunk sizes hitting 200K (way over the 128K limit). I\u2019ll break down each problem, explain what\u2019s going on, and fix it so we\u2019re back on track. Let\u2019s dive in.\nIssue 1: Duplicative Summaries\nYou mentioned summaries are duplicative, which likely means the script is generating unnecessary or redundant summaries for sections. Here\u2019s why this might be happening:\nCurrent Summary Logic: The script creates a summary for any section over 5,000 characters by taking the first 200 characters + \"...\". If a section is under 5K, it uses the full text as the summary. But in your case, the full text might already be included elsewhere, making the summary feel redundant.\n\nPossible Cause: The script is storing both text (the full section minus code) and summary, but for DeepSearch, we might not need both in the output. If the section is short, having text and summary identical is redundant.\n\nFix:\nOnly include summary if the section is long (over 5K characters).\n\nFor short sections, just keep text and skip summary to avoid duplication.\n\nIssue 2: Code Blocks Not Being Removed\nYou\u2019re not seeing code blocks eliminated, which means the regex isn\u2019t catching them. Here\u2019s how code blocks are defined and why it might be missing them:\nCode Block Definition: The script looks for text wrapped in triple backticks (```), which is the standard Markdown format for code blocks. For example:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nPossible Causes:\nYour code blocks might not be wrapped in triple backticks. Maybe they\u2019re indented or formatted differently.\n\nThere could be variations like single backticks (`code`) or no markers at all.\n\nCheck Your Transcript: Look for how code is formatted. If it\u2019s not using triple backticks, we\u2019ll adjust the regex.\n\nFix:\nUpdate the Regex: If your code is indented (e.g., four spaces or a tab), we can add a pattern to catch indented blocks.\n\nManual Check: Open the transcript and search for code-like sections (e.g., def, import, { \"key\": \"value\" }). If they\u2019re not wrapped, we\u2019ll need a smarter way to detect them.\n\nIssue 3: Chunk Sizes Over 128K\nYou\u2019ve got a chunk hitting 200K characters, which is way over the 128K limit. Here\u2019s why:\nCurrent Chunking Logic: It groups sections until the total size hits 128K, but if a single section is over 128K, it\u2019ll start a new chunk with that section alone. If that section is 200K, the chunk will be 200K.\n\nYour Transcript: You mentioned some sections are 50K+, but one might be sneaking over 128K after preprocessing.\n\nFix:\nFlag Oversized Sections: Modify the script to log any section over 128K so you can handle it manually.\n\nSplit Large Sections: If a section exceeds 128K, we can break it into subparts (e.g., prompt_001_part1, prompt_001_part2), but that\u2019s tricky without losing context.\n\nUpdated Script with Fixes\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll address each issue:\nSummaries:\nOnly include summary if the section is over 5K characters.\n\nCode Blocks:\nAdd regex for indented code blocks (e.g., lines starting with four spaces or a tab).\n\nLog if code blocks are found and removed.\n\nChunk Sizes:\nLog any section larger than 128K.\n\nFor now, keep oversized sections in their own chunk and flag them.\n\nUpdated preprocess.py:\npython\n\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Configurable markers\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    \n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"\n        \n        # Remove code blocks: triple backticks or indented code\n        text = re.sub(r'```.*?```', '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        text = re.sub(r'(^ {4,}.*?$)+', '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)\n        \n        # Only add summary if text is over 5K characters\n        if len(text) > 5000:\n            summary = text[:200] + \"...\"\n        else:\n            summary = None  # No summary for short sections\n        \n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text, \"summary\": summary})\n    \n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    \n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if section_size > max_size:\n            log_progress(f\"WARNING: Section {section['id']} is {section_size} characters, over {max_size} limit!\")\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            chunks.append([section])  # Oversized section gets its own chunk\n            current_chunk = []\n            current_size = 0\n        elif current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    \n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    \n    return chunks\n\ndef read_transcript(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        return f.read()\n\ndef log_progress(message):\n    print(f\"[LOG] {message}\")\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir=\"processed_output\"):\n    log_progress(f\"Starting preprocessing for {transcript_file}\")\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    \n    transcript = read_transcript(transcript_file)\n    log_progress(f\"Transcript loaded: {len(transcript)} characters\")\n    \n    sections = preprocess_transcript(transcript)\n    log_progress(f\"Split into {len(sections)} sections\")\n    \n    # Check for code blocks\n    code_blocks_removed = sum('[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]' in s['text'] for s in sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Code blocks removed in {code_blocks_removed} sections\")\n    \n    chunks = create_chunks(sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Grouped into {len(chunks)} chunks\")\n    \n    # Save chunks\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"chunk_{i + 1}.json\")\n        with open(chunk_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(chunk, f, indent=2)\n        log_progress(f\"Saved chunk {i + 1} to {chunk_file}\")\n    \n    log_progress(\"Preprocessing complete!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    transcript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"\n    main(transcript_file)\n\nHow to Test the Fixes\nRun the Updated Script:\nReplace transcript_file with your combined transcript path.\n\nRun python preprocess.py.\n\nCheck Logs:\nLook for [LOG] Code blocks removed in X sections.

Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey! I\u2019m thrilled the script worked for you\u2014that\u2019s a big step forward! I see you\u2019ve flagged a few issues: duplicative summaries, code blocks not being removed, and a file size hitting 200K, which is way over the 128K limit we\u2019re aiming for. Let\u2019s break this down and get everything sorted out. I\u2019ll explain each issue in plain English, including how code blocks are defined, and walk you through the fixes.\n1. Duplicative Summaries\nWhat\u2019s Happening: You\u2019re seeing summaries that feel redundant, likely because the script is creating a summary for every section, even when it\u2019s not necessary. Right now, if a section is over 5,000 characters, it makes a summary by taking the first 200 characters and adding \"...\". If it\u2019s under 5K, it just uses the full text as the summary\u2014which can end up duplicating the text you already have, making it feel repetitive.\nWhy It\u2019s a Problem: This duplication is bloating the output, and for something like DeepSearch, we don\u2019t need both the full text and an identical summary for short sections.\nThe Fix: We\u2019ll tweak the script so it only adds a summary when the section is long (over 5K characters). For shorter sections, we\u2019ll skip the summary entirely and just keep the text. This cuts out the redundancy and keeps things lean.\n2. Code Blocks Not Being Removed\nWhat\u2019s Happening: You\u2019re not seeing code blocks stripped out, which means the script isn\u2019t detecting them properly.\nHow a Code Block Is Defined: In the script, a code block is text wrapped in triple backticks (```), which is a common Markdown format. For example:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nThe script looks for anything between ``` and ``` and replaces it with `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]`. But if your code isn\u2019t formatted this way, it won\u2019t catch it.\n\n**Why It\u2019s Not Working**: Your transcript might have code formatted differently\u2014like indented with four spaces (another Markdown style), wrapped in single backticks (`code`), or not marked at all. For example:\n- Indented code:\n\n  def hello():\n      print(\"Hi!\")\n\n- Single backticks: `print(\"Hello\")`\n\n**The Fix**: \n- We\u2019ll update the script to also catch indented code (lines starting with four spaces or a tab).\n- I need you to check your transcript and let me know how the code looks. Open it up, find a code-like section (e.g., something with `def`, `import`, or curly braces `{}`), and tell me if it\u2019s wrapped in triple backticks, indented, or something else. If it\u2019s not being caught, we\u2019ll adjust the detection to match.\n\n---\n\n### 3. File Size Hitting 200K\n**What\u2019s Happening**: One of your chunks is 200K characters, which is way over the 128K limit we\u2019re targeting. This is pushing the file size up, especially with the summaries and markers adding extra bulk.\n\n**Why It\u2019s Happening**: The script groups sections into chunks up to 128K. But if a single section is over 128K\u2014like one of your 50K+ sections growing even bigger after processing\u2014it gets its own chunk, and that chunk can exceed the limit. A 200K section means we\u2019ve got something oversized sneaking through.\n\n**The Fix**:\n- **Flag Oversized Sections**: We\u2019ll make the script log a warning if any section is over 128K, so you can spot it easily.\n- **Keep It Under Control**: For now, we\u2019ll let oversized sections sit in their own chunk and flag them. Later, we can split them into smaller parts (e.g., `prompt_001_part1`, `prompt_001_part2`), but we\u2019ll need to be careful not to lose context.\n- Cutting duplicative summaries (from Fix #1) will also help reduce the size.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Plan\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll fix the script:\n- **Summaries**: Only include them for sections over 5K characters\u2014no summary for short ones.\n- **Code Blocks**: Add detection for indented code (four spaces or tabs) on top of triple backticks, and log when code is removed so we can confirm it\u2019s working.\n- **Chunk Sizes**: Warn you about sections over 128K and keep them isolated in their own chunks for now.\n\nI\u2019ve updated the script (you can find it in the thinking trace if you\u2019re curious), but you don\u2019t need to dig into the code yet. Here\u2019s what to do next:\n\n---\n\n### How to Test This\n1. **Run the Updated Script**:\n - Use your transcript file with the new version I\u2019ve outlined.\n \n2. **Check the Logs**:\n - Look for a message like `[LOG] Code blocks removed in X sections`. If it says 0, the code blocks aren\u2019t being detected\u2014let me know how your code is formatted.\n - Watch for warnings like `[LOG] WARNING: Section prompt_001 is 200000 characters, over 128000 limit!`. That\u2019ll pinpoint any oversized sections.\n\n3. **Inspect the Output**:\n - Open a `chunk_X.json` file and check:\n   - Summaries only appear for long sections (over 5K characters).\n   - Code blocks are replaced with `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]`.\n   - Most chunks are under 128K, except maybe one flagged oversized section.\n\n---\n\n### What I Need From You\n- **Code Formatting**: Peek at your transcript and tell me how the code looks (triple backticks, indented, etc.). A quick snippet would be perfect.\n- **Test Results**: After running the updated script, let me know if the summaries are less duplicative, if code blocks are gone, and if any chunks are still over 128K.\n\nWe\u2019re super close to nailing this\u2014let\u2019s get it locked down!\n\nWhy do we need summaries at all? What's the value? We're not trying to summarize and these aren't even summaries, they're just the first 200 words, which are already contained. I think actual summaries will add value when we're querying the database, but not now, just bloat unless I'm missing something. Some examples of code blocks from your transcript. This will likely adjust as well between transcripts, so should be a setting at the top like prompt identifiers if possible.Format Design: I create a structured format, such as:{\n  \"entry_id\": 1,\n  \"speaker\": \"Human\",\n  \"text\": \"What is the weather today?\",\n  \"vector\": [0.12, -0.45, 0.89, ...], // Simplified semantic embedding\n  \"emphasis\": [\"weather\", \"today\"],\n  \"tags\": {\"intent\": \"query\", \"topic\": \"weather\"}\n}Parsing Execution: I apply t\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nSo, Jesse's got a point here. Summaries might not be necessary right now, especially if they're just the first 200 words, which are already in the text. The goal is to preprocess the transcript for DeepSearch to tag, not to summarize it yet. Summaries could be useful later when querying the database, but for now, they might be adding unnecessary bloat.\nJesse also provided an example of a code block from the transcript. It looks like the code blocks are formatted with triple backticks (```), which is standard Markdown for code. The script should already be catching these, but Jesse mentioned that code blocks aren't being removed, so there might be an issue with the detection or the way the transcript is formatted.\nThe code blocks in the transcript are likely causing the file size to balloon, especially if they're not being removed properly. The script needs to reliably detect and remove these code blocks to keep the file size manageable.\nJesse also mentioned that the format of code blocks might vary between transcripts, so it would be helpful to have a setting at the top of the script to define how code blocks are formatted. This could be a list of patterns or markers that indicate a code block.\nFor now, the priority is to get the preprocessing script working correctly: splitting the transcript into sections, assigning unique IDs, removing code blocks, and chunking the sections into manageable sizes for DeepSearch.\nI should update the script to:\nRemove the summaries entirely, as they're not needed at this stage.\n\nImprove code block detection to handle different formats, starting with triple backticks and indented code.\n\nAdd a setting at the top for defining code block markers, making it flexible for different transcripts.\n\nEnsure that the chunking logic respects the 128K limit and logs any oversized sections.\n\nI need to think about how to make the code block detection flexible. Maybe allow the user to specify a list of patterns or markers that indicate the start and end of a code block. For example, triple backticks, indented lines, or specific keywords.\nAlso, I should make sure that the script logs when code blocks are removed and provides details about what was removed, so Jesse can verify that it's working correctly.\nLet me sketch out the changes:\nRemove the summary logic from the preprocess_transcript function.\n\nAdd a list at the top for code block patterns, e.g., CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'.*?', r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)']\n\nUpdate the preprocess_transcript function to use these patterns to remove code blocks.\n\nIn the create_chunks function, ensure that chunks are under 128K and log warnings for oversized sections.\n\nWait, actually, since we're removing the summaries, the file size should decrease, but we still need to handle cases where individual sections are over 128K.\nI should also think about how to handle sections that are still over 128K after removing code blocks. Maybe split them into smaller parts, but that could be tricky without losing context.\nFor now, I'll focus on removing the summaries and improving code block detection. Once that's working, we can address any remaining oversized sections.\nLet me update the script accordingly.\nFirst, remove the summary logic:\nIn preprocess_transcript, instead of creating a summary, just keep the text after removing code blocks.\nSo, result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\nThen, for code block detection, add a list at the top:\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [\n    r'.*?',  # Triple backticks\n    r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)'  # Indented code (four spaces)\n]\nThen, in preprocess_transcript, use these patterns to remove code blocks:\nfor pattern in CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS:\n    text = re.sub(pattern, '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', text, flags=re.DOTALL)\nWait, but the indented code pattern might need to be more precise. Indented code typically starts with four spaces or a tab, and continues until a line that doesn't start with four spaces.\nActually, a better way is to look for blocks of lines that start with four spaces or a tab.\nBut regex might not be the best for that. Maybe process the text line by line.\nAlternatively, since the transcript is likely to have code blocks wrapped in triple backticks, and Jesse's example shows that, we can start with that and add more patterns as needed.\nI'll proceed with the triple backtick pattern for now and ask Jesse to confirm if there are other formats.\nAlso, I should add logging to show when code blocks are removed.\nFor example, count how many code blocks are removed per section and log it.\nSomething like:\ncode_blocks_removed = len(re.findall(r'.*?', section, re.DOTALL))\nif code_blocks_removed > 0:\n    log_progress(f\"Removed {code_blocks_removed} code blocks from {id}\")\nThen, in the main function, after preprocessing, log the total number of code blocks removed.\nThis way, Jesse can see if the script is detecting and removing code blocks.\nRegarding the chunk size, since we're removing summaries, the file size should be smaller, but we still need to ensure that chunks are under 128K.\nIn the create_chunks function, I'll add a check for the size of each chunk and log if any chunk is over 128K.\nWait, actually, the logic already tries to keep chunks under 128K by starting a new chunk when adding a section would exceed the limit.\nBut if a single section is over 128K, it will be in its own chunk, and that chunk will be over 128K.\nSo, I need to add a warning for that case.\nFor example, after creating chunks, iterate through them and check their sizes.\nBut since the chunk is a list of sections, I need to calculate the total size.\nWait, in the current script, it calculates the size based on the sum of len(section['text']) for each section in the chunk.\nSo, I can add a check after creating the chunks:\nfor i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n    chunk_size = sum(len(s['text']) for s in chunk)\n    if chunk_size > max_size:\n        log_progress(f\"WARNING: Chunk {i+1} is {chunk_size} characters, over {max_size} limit!\")\n    else:\n        log_progress(f\"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk_size} characters\")\nThis way, Jesse can see if any chunks are oversized and which ones.\nThen, for oversized chunks, we can decide how to handle them later, maybe by splitting the large section into smaller parts.\nBut for now, let's get the preprocessing working correctly.\nI think with these changes, the script should be in good shape.\nLet me summarize the updates:\nRemove the summary logic from preprocess_transcript.\n\nAdd CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS at the top for flexibility.\n\nUse these patterns to remove code blocks in preprocess_transcript.\n\nAdd logging for code blocks removed per section.\n\nAdd logging for chunk sizes and warnings for oversized chunks.\n\nI should also make sure that the script handles cases where there are no code blocks or where the entire section is a code block.\nFor example, if a section is entirely wrapped in triple backticks, it should be replaced with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY], but maybe we want to keep some context, like the speaker and a note that it's a code block.\nWait, in the current logic, since the marker is at the start, like [JESSE PROMPT], and then the text, if the text is a code block, it would replace the entire text with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY], which might not be ideal.\nMaybe we should keep the marker and a note, like [JESSE PROMPT] [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]\nBut actually, since the purpose is to tag the content, and code blocks are not relevant for tagging, replacing them with a placeholder is fine.\nDeepSearch can still see that there was a code block and tag accordingly, maybe with #CODE_REFERENCE or something.\nSo, I think the current approach is okay.\nAlright, I think this covers the main issues.\nLet me think about the file size again.\nSince we're removing summaries and code blocks, the file size should decrease significantly.\nIf a chunk is still over 128K, it's likely because some sections are very large, even without code.\nIn that case, we might need to split those large sections, but that's a separate issue.\nFor now, let's proceed with these updates and see how it goes.\nI should also mention that if Jesse wants to keep certain code blocks, like JSON prompts, we can add logic to detect and preserve them.\nBut from the previous discussion, it seems that JSON prompts are important and should be kept, while debugging code can be summarized.\nSo, perhaps we need to distinguish between code blocks that are JSON prompts and those that are debugging code.\nOne way to do that is to check if the code block is valid JSON and contains certain keys, like \"message_type\".\nIf it does, preserve it; otherwise, summarize it.\nThat could be a good enhancement.\nLet me add that to the script.\nI'll update the process_code_blocks function to check if the code block is a JSON prompt.\nFirst, define a function to check if text is a JSON prompt:\ndef is_json_prompt(text):\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(text)\n        return \"message_type\" in data and \"sender_id\" in data\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        return False\nThen, in preprocess_transcript, when removing code blocks, if the code block is a JSON prompt, keep it; otherwise, replace it.\nWait, actually, since the code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks, but JSON prompts might be as well, or they might be inline.\nIn the example Jesse provided, it's not clear if JSON prompts are wrapped in triple backticks or not.\nWait, in the thinking trace, Jesse said: \"Here\u2019s a JSON: {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}\"\nSo, it might be inline, not necessarily in a code block.\nIf it's inline, the current code block removal won't affect it, as it's not wrapped in triple backticks.\nBut if it's in a code block, like json { \"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\" } , then it would be removed.\nSo, to preserve JSON prompts, I can check if the code block is valid JSON and contains \"message_type\", and if so, keep it.\nOtherwise, replace it with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY].\nThat way, JSON prompts in code blocks are preserved, while other code is summarized.\nFor inline JSON, it won't be affected by the code block removal.\nI think that's a good approach.\nLet me update the script accordingly.\nIn preprocess_transcript, when removing code blocks:\ncode_pattern = r'(?:\\w+)?\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n'\nblocks = re.findall(code_pattern, section, re.DOTALL)\nfor block in blocks:\n    if is_json_prompt(block.strip()):\n        continue  # Keep JSON prompts\n    else:\n        section = section.replace(f\"\\n{block}\\n\", '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]')\nWait, actually, since it's findall, I need to replace each occurrence.\nBetter to use re.sub with a callback function.\nLike:\ndef replace_code_block(match):\n    block = match.group(1)\n    if is_json_prompt(block.strip()):\n        return match.group(0)  # Keep the original\n    else:\n        return '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]'\nsection = re.sub(code_pattern, replace_code_block, section, flags=re.DOTALL)\nYes, that's better.\nAnd define is_json_prompt as above.\nThis way, JSON prompts in code blocks are preserved, while other code is summarized.\nFor inline JSON, it stays as is.\nI think this covers the cases.\nAlright, with these updates, the script should be ready.\nLet me summarize the final changes:\nRemove summary logic entirely.\n\nAdd CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS, but for now, focus on triple backticks.\n\nIn preprocess_transcript, use re.sub with a callback to replace code blocks, preserving JSON prompts.\n\nAdd logging for code blocks removed and preserved.\n\nIn create_chunks, log the size of each chunk and warn if over 128K.\n\nAlso, since the file size was 200K for one chunk, it's likely that a single section is very large.\nAfter removing code blocks, it might be smaller, but we need to check.\nIf not, we might need to split large sections.\nBut let's first see with the updated script.\nI think this is a solid plan.\nHey Jesse,\nAwesome to hear the script worked\u2014now let\u2019s squash those issues and get it dialed in. You\u2019re right to question the summaries; they\u2019re not needed right now, and they\u2019re just bloating the output. I\u2019ve also got the code block detection fixed, especially since your transcript uses triple backticks (```) for code, as shown in your example. We\u2019ll make the script flexible for different transcripts by adding a setting at the top. Let\u2019s break it all down and get this locked in.\n1. Summaries: Why They\u2019re Not Needed (and How to Remove Them)\nWhat They Are: Right now, the script adds a \u201csummary\u201d field for each section. If the section is over 5,000 characters, it takes the first 200 characters and adds \"...\". If it\u2019s under 5K, it just duplicates the full text. That\u2019s not a real summary\u2014it\u2019s redundant and bloating the file size.\n\nWhy They\u2019re Not Needed: For DeepSearch\u2019s tagging, we only need the cleaned text (no code blocks) and the unique ID. Summaries are overkill at this stage and can be added later if we need to query the database. For now, they\u2019re just eating space.\n\nThe Fix: We\u2019ll remove the summary logic entirely. The output will only include the ID and the cleaned text for each section, keeping it lean.\n\n2. Code Blocks: Detection and Removal\nHow Code Blocks Are Defined: In your transcript, code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks (```), like this:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nThe script looks for anything between ``` and ``` and replaces it with `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]`.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Not Working: If the code blocks aren\u2019t being removed, it might be because they\u2019re formatted differently or there\u2019s a mismatch in the regex. Your example shows triple backticks, so the script should catch them, but we\u2019ll add flexibility for other formats (like indented code) and log removals to confirm it\u2019s working.\n\nFlexibility for Other Transcripts: We\u2019ll add a CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS list at the top of the script. You can define different patterns (e.g., triple backticks, indented code) depending on the transcript. For now, we\u2019ll focus on triple backticks since that\u2019s what your transcript uses.\n\n3. File Size and Chunking\nWhy Chunks Are Over 128K: Even after removing summaries, if a single section is over 128K (e.g., a massive prompt or response), it\u2019ll end up in its own chunk, which will still be over the limit. We need to flag these so you can handle them manually or split them later.\n\nThe Fix: The script will log a warning if any chunk exceeds 128K, so you know exactly which sections are too big. For now, we\u2019ll keep them as-is and deal with them after preprocessing.\n\nUpdated Script: Lean, Mean, and Ready to Go\nHere\u2019s the refined script with these fixes:\nNo summaries.\n\nCode block removal for triple backticks (with flexibility for other patterns).\n\nLogging for code block removals and chunk sizes.\n\nWarnings for oversized chunks.\n\nSave this as preprocess_v2.py and update the file path to your transcript:\npython\n\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Configurable markers and code block patterns\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'```.*?```']  # Add more patterns if needed (e.g., r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)')\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split transcript into sections, assign IDs, and remove code blocks.\n    Returns a list of dictionaries with id and cleaned text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split into sections, keeping markers with their text\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    \n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"  # e.g., prompt_001, response_001\n        \n        # Remove code blocks using defined patterns\n        for pattern in CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS:\n            code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, section, re.DOTALL)\n            for block in code_blocks:\n                section = section.replace(block, '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]')\n        \n        # Log code block removals\n        removed_count = len(code_blocks)\n        if removed_count > 0:\n            log_progress(f\"Removed {removed_count} code blocks from {id}\")\n        \n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": section})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Group sections into chunks under 128K characters, respecting boundaries.\n    Returns a list of chunks, where each chunk is a list of sections.\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    \n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    \n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    \n    return chunks\n\ndef read_transcript(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Read the transcript from a file.\"\"\"\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        return f.read()\n\ndef log_progress(message):\n    \"\"\"Log progress to console.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"[LOG] {message}\")\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir=\"processed_output\"):\n    log_progress(f\"Starting preprocessing for {transcript_file}\")\n    \n    # Create output directory\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    \n    # Load and preprocess\n    transcript = read_transcript(transcript_file)\n    log_progress(f\"Transcript loaded: {len(transcript)} characters\")\n    \n    sections = preprocess_transcript(transcript)\n    log_progress(f\"Split into {len(sections)} sections\")\n    \n    chunks = create_chunks(sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Grouped into {len(chunks)} chunks\")\n    \n    # Save chunks and log sizes\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"chunk_{i + 1}.json\")\n        with open(chunk_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(chunk, f, indent=2)\n        chunk_size = sum(len(s['text']) for s in chunk)\n        if chunk_size > 128000:\n            log_progress(f\"WARNING: Chunk {i+1} is {chunk_size} characters, over 128000 limit!\")\n        else:\n            log_progress(f\"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk_size} characters\")\n    \n    log_progress(\"Preprocessing complete!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Update this to your transcript path\n    transcript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"\n    main(transcript_file)\n\nHow to Use It\nUpdate the Script:\nReplace \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\" with your actual file path.\n\nRun It:\nOpen CMD, navigate to the script\u2019s directory, and run python preprocess_v2.py.\n\nWatch the logs:\n[LOG] Removed X code blocks from prompt_001\n\n[LOG] Chunk 1: 120000 characters\n\n[LOG] WARNING: Chunk 2 is 200000 characters, over 128000 limit! (if any)\n\nCheck the Output:\nOpen processed_output/chunk_1.json and confirm:\nNo summaries.\n\nCode blocks replaced with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY].\n\nChunks under 128K (or flagged if over).\n\nNext Steps\nRun the Script: Test it with your transcript and check if code blocks are removed (look for [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY] in the text).\n\nOversized Chunks: If you see warnings, note which chunks are over 128K. We can split them later if needed.\n\nCode Block Formats: If the script misses code blocks, let me know how they\u2019re formatted (e.g., indented, single backticks), and I\u2019ll adjust CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS.\n\nWe\u2019re almost there\u2014let\u2019s get this preprocessing nailed down! Let me know how it goes or if you need tweaks. LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey there,\nGreat questions! Let\u2019s dive into why summaries might not be needed right now, their potential value, and how we can handle code blocks effectively based on your input. I\u2019ll also tie this back to the structured format you\u2019re designing and how it fits into the preprocessing plan.\nWhy Summaries? (Or Why Not?)\nYou\u2019re spot-on with your observation: the current \"summaries\" in the preprocessing script aren\u2019t really summaries\u2014they\u2019re just the first 200 characters of a section (if it\u2019s over 5,000 characters) or the full text (if under). That\u2019s not adding value; it\u2019s duplicating what\u2019s already there and bloating the output.\nCurrent Situation\nWhat\u2019s Happening: The script takes each section (e.g., [JESSE PROMPT] or [GROK RESPONSE]), and if it\u2019s long, it grabs the first 200 characters and adds \"...\". If it\u2019s short, it copies the whole text as a \u201csummary.\u201d\n\nProblem: This isn\u2019t summarizing\u2014it\u2019s redundant. The full text is already in the text field, so this just increases the file size without helping DeepSearch tag anything.\n\nValue of Real Summaries\nWhen They\u2019d Help: Actual summaries (e.g., concise distillations of the content) would be valuable later, when querying the database. For example:\nQuery: \u201cFind all prompts about weather.\u201d\n\nA summary like \u201cUser asks about today\u2019s weather\u201d could help filter results faster than scanning full text.\n\nWhy Not Now: At this preprocessing stage, DeepSearch needs the raw, cleaned text to tag intents, topics, and embeddings. Summaries aren\u2019t needed for that\u2014they\u2019d just be extra noise. You\u2019re right: they\u2019re bloat unless they\u2019re true summaries, which we can add post-tagging if needed.\n\nConclusion\nAction: Ditch the summaries entirely for now. Keep the output lean with just id and text (cleaned of code blocks). We can revisit real summaries later when querying.\n\nCode Blocks: Handling and Flexibility\nYou mentioned code blocks vary between transcripts, and you shared an example format. Let\u2019s address how to detect and remove them, making it adjustable with a setting at the top.\nYour Example\nYou didn\u2019t specify a exact code block from your transcript in the query, but you\u2019ve implied they exist (e.g., in the context of JSON like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}). I\u2019ll assume a common format like triple backticks (```), which is standard Markdown:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nOr maybe inline JSON like `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}`. Let me know if it\u2019s different!\n\n#### Why They Matter\n- **File Size**: Code blocks (especially debugging code) inflate the transcript. Removing them reduces the size for DeepSearch.\n- **Tagging**: DeepSearch doesn\u2019t need code for semantic tagging\u2014replacing it with `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]` keeps the structure without the noise.\n\n#### Making It Flexible\n- **Setting at the Top**: We\u2019ll define a `CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS` list in the script. You can tweak it per transcript. For example:\n  ```python\n  CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [\n      r'```.*?```',          # Triple backticks (e.g., ```python ... ```)\n      r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)'  # Indented code (4 spaces, ends at blank line or EOF)\n  ]\n\nHow It Works: The script uses these regex patterns to find and replace code blocks with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]. If your transcript uses single backticks or something else, just add it to the list.\n\nExecution\nDetection: For each section, the script scans for matches to these patterns and swaps them out.\n\nLogging: It\u2019ll log how many code blocks were removed per section (e.g., \u201cRemoved 2 code blocks from prompt_001\u201d) so you can verify it\u2019s working.\n\nTying It to Your Structured Format\nYour design looks like this:\njson\n\n{\n  \"entry_id\": 1,\n  \"speaker\": \"Human\",\n  \"text\": \"What is the weather today?\",\n  \"vector\": [0.12, -0.45, 0.89, ...],\n  \"emphasis\": [\"weather\", \"today\"],\n  \"tags\": {\"intent\": \"query\", \"topic\": \"weather\"}\n}\n\nHere\u2019s how the preprocessing aligns:\nentry_id: The script assigns unique IDs (e.g., prompt_001, response_001).\n\nspeaker: Inferred from markers like [JESSE PROMPT] (Jesse) or [GROK RESPONSE] (Grok).\n\ntext: The cleaned text (code blocks removed) goes here.\n\nvector, emphasis, tags: DeepSearch handles these post-preprocessing based on the text.\n\nBy removing summaries and code blocks, we keep the text field lean and relevant, setting up DeepSearch to generate those vectors and tags accurately.\nUpdated Plan\nHere\u2019s the refined approach based on your query:\nNo Summaries: Remove the summary logic from the script. Output only {\"id\": \"prompt_001\", \"text\": \"...\"}.\n\nCode Block Removal:\nUse CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS at the top for flexibility.\n\nDefault to r'```.*?```' since it\u2019s common, but you can adjust it.\n\nReplace matches with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY].\n\nChunking: Ensure chunks stay under 128K, logging warnings if they\u2019re over (e.g., a huge section).\n\nSample Script Snippet\npython\n\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'```.*?```']  # Adjust as needed\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    sections = re.split(r'(\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]|\\[GROK RESPONSE\\])', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if \"[JESSE PROMPT]\" in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"\n        for pattern in CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS:\n            section = re.sub(pattern, '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": section})\n    return result\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nTest It: Run the updated script (I\u2019ll share the full version if needed) on your transcript. Check if code blocks are caught and replaced.\n\nFeedback: If code blocks are formatted differently (e.g., indented, not triple backticks), let me know, and I\u2019ll tweak CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS.\n\nOversized Chunks: If chunks exceed 128K after cleanup, we\u2019ll split those sections later.\n\nYou\u2019re not missing anything\u2014summaries don\u2019t belong here yet, and code blocks need a flexible fix. Let\u2019s get this rolling and refine as we go! Thoughts?\n\nI did provide a code example from your transcript and you printed it. It appears that for json, your code starts with 'json {' 'File'  with no end other than the closing } and then normal text after. Problem is we use json a lot for the messages going back and forth between AI including 'morning' wake up prompts. I'm not sure it makes sense to exclude these. What do you think? I don't know! Summaries are wasteful, so no issues with cutting them on my end. Keep it clean!\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nAlright, Jesse, let\u2019s tackle this head-on. You\u2019re right\u2014summaries are just bloat at this stage, so we\u2019ll cut them entirely. No need to worry about those anymore. Now, let\u2019s focus on the code blocks and JSON issue.\nFirst, I need to clarify what exactly constitutes a code block in your transcript. You mentioned that for JSON, it starts with 'json {' and ends with '}', but it\u2019s not wrapped in triple backticks or indented. That\u2019s a problem because the script is currently only looking for triple backticks (```) to identify code blocks. If your JSON or code isn\u2019t formatted that way, the script won\u2019t catch it, which explains why it\u2019s not removing them.\nHere\u2019s the deal: JSON messages are a gray area. On one hand, they\u2019re structured data, similar to code, but on the other, they\u2019re crucial for understanding the AI-AI communication, especially since they\u2019re part of your wake-up prompts and other key interactions. Removing them could strip away important context that DeepSearch needs for tagging.\nSo, I think we should keep the JSON messages intact. They\u2019re not just code\u2014they\u2019re part of the conversation flow. But for actual code blocks\u2014like Python scripts or debugging code\u2014we still want to remove or summarize them to reduce clutter.\nTo handle this, we need a way to distinguish between:\nJSON messages (e.g., {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}) that are part of the conversation.\n\nActual code blocks (e.g., def hello(): print(\"Hi\")) that are just implementation details.\n\nOne approach is to define patterns that identify code but not JSON. For example:\nCode: Look for keywords like def, import, class, or multiple lines of indented text.\n\nJSON: Look for text that starts with { and ends with }, but only if it doesn\u2019t contain conversation-specific keys like \"message_type\".\n\nBut that might be too brittle. A better idea: since your JSON messages are part of the prompts and responses, we can assume that any JSON-like text within a [JESSE PROMPT] or [GROK RESPONSE] is intentional and should be kept.\nWait, actually, in your earlier query, you mentioned that JSON is used for messages going back and forth between AIs, including wake-up prompts. So, in the transcript, these JSON blocks are the actual content of the prompts and responses, not just code snippets.\nLet me confirm: in your transcript, are the JSON blocks the main content of the [JESSE PROMPT] or [GROK RESPONSE], or are they embedded within larger text blocks?\nIf they are the main content, like:\n\n[JESSE PROMPT] {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\", \"content\": \"Do this task\"}\n\nThen we definitely don\u2019t want to remove them\u2014they\u2019re the core of the interaction.\nBut if they\u2019re embedded, like:\n\n[JESSE PROMPT] Here\u2019s a task: {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}. What do you think?\n\nThen we might want to handle them differently.\nWait, in your example, you said: \"Problem is we use json a lot for the messages going back and forth between AI including 'morning' wake up prompts.\" So, I think the JSON is the primary content of the prompts and responses.\nIf that\u2019s the case, we shouldn\u2019t remove them at all. Instead, we should only target actual code blocks, like Python scripts or other programming languages, that are not part of the JSON communication.\nSo, perhaps the solution is to only remove code blocks that are explicitly marked as code, like those wrapped in triple backticks, or indented code blocks, but leave any JSON intact, as it\u2019s part of the conversation.\nAlternatively, if there are specific patterns that indicate a code block versus a JSON message, we can define those patterns.\nWait, another idea: since your JSON messages are likely to have specific keys like \"message_type\", \"sender_id\", etc., we can check if a JSON-like block contains these keys. If it does, it\u2019s a message and should be kept; if not, it might be code or data and can be summarized.\nFor example:\n{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\", \"content\": \"Do this\"} \u2192 keep it.\n\n{\"data\": [1, 2, 3], \"config\": {\"timeout\": 30}} \u2192 maybe summarize if it\u2019s not a message.\n\nBut this might be overcomplicating it. Perhaps the simplest approach is to only remove code blocks that are explicitly marked with triple backticks or indented, and leave everything else as is.\nGiven that, I\u2019ll update the script to only target triple backtick code blocks for removal, and keep all other text, including JSON, intact.\nIf your transcript doesn\u2019t use triple backticks, we\u2019ll need to find another way to identify code blocks. For example, if code is always preceded by a phrase like \"Here\u2019s some code:\" or something similar, we can use that as a marker.\nAlternatively, we can look for patterns that indicate code, like lines starting with def, import, etc., but that might catch false positives in regular text.\nWait, actually, since your transcript is a chat, and code blocks are likely to be multi-line and contain programming keywords, we can define a heuristic: if a block of text has multiple lines with programming keywords (e.g., def, class, import, if, for, etc.), it\u2019s probably code and can be summarized.\nBut that\u2019s still tricky. Maybe the best way is to manually inspect a few sections and see how code is presented.\nWait, in your earlier message, you said: \"I did provide a code example from your transcript and you printed it. It appears that for json, your code starts with 'json {' 'File' with no end other than the closing } and then normal text after.\"\nWait, actually, in the query, you said: \"Format Design: I create a structured format, such as: { \"entry_id\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Human\", \"text\": \"What is the weather today?\", \"vector\": [0.12, -0.45, 0.89, ...], // Simplified semantic embedding \"emphasis\": [\"weather\", \"today\"], \"tags\": {\"intent\": \"query\", \"topic\": \"weather\"} } Parsing Execution: I apply t\"\nHmm, it seems like the code block is cut off, but it looks like you\u2019re showing an example of the structured format, which includes JSON.\nWait, perhaps in your transcript, there are sections where you or the AI are discussing or presenting JSON structures as part of the conversation.\nIn that case, since it\u2019s part of the discussion, we probably want to keep it.\nLet me propose this: unless the code block is explicitly marked with triple backticks or another clear indicator, we\u2019ll keep all text as is. If there are specific patterns you want to remove, we can define them.\nAlternatively, if you can provide a snippet of your transcript that includes both a JSON message and a code block, I can tailor the detection logic accordingly.\nFor now, I\u2019ll assume that code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks, and everything else, including JSON, should be kept.\nSo, in the script, I\u2019ll only remove text that matches the pattern r'.*?'.\nIf that\u2019s not sufficient, we can add more patterns.\nWait, actually, in your thinking trace, you mentioned that in my transcript, code blocks might not be wrapped in triple backticks. Let me check the transcript.\nLooking back, in the conversation, when I provide code, I do use triple backticks, like:\npython\n\nimport re\n# ...\n\nSo, in this chat, code blocks are indeed wrapped in triple backticks. If your transcript follows a similar convention, then the script should catch them.\nBut you mentioned that in your transcript, code blocks might be formatted differently. Can you confirm how code is presented in your transcript? Is it wrapped in triple backticks, or is it just indented, or something else?\nWait, in your earlier message, you said: \"I did provide a code example from your transcript and you printed it.\" But in the query, it\u2019s not clear what the example was. Perhaps it was the JSON structure.\nWait, actually, in the query, you said: \"Format Design: I create a structured format, such as: { \"entry_id\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Human\", \"text\": \"What is the weather today?\", \"vector\": [0.12, -0.45, 0.89, ...], // Simplified semantic embedding \"emphasis\": [\"weather\", \"today\"], \"tags\": {\"intent\": \"query\", \"topic\": \"weather\"} } Parsing Execution: I apply t\"\nIt seems like the JSON is part of the text, not wrapped in backticks. So, in this case, it\u2019s not a code block\u2014it\u2019s just text that happens to be JSON.\nTherefore, the script shouldn\u2019t remove it, as it\u2019s not wrapped in triple backticks.\nSo, if your transcript has code blocks wrapped in triple backticks, the script will remove those, but leave JSON that\u2019s part of the conversation intact.\nIf that\u2019s the case, then the script is already doing what we want: removing only explicitly marked code blocks, and keeping everything else, including JSON.\nBut you mentioned that the file size is still 200K, which suggests that either:\nThere are no code blocks to remove, or\n\nThe sections are inherently large, even without code.\n\nWait, in your earlier message, you said: \"Some prompts and responses are 50K+. I doubt any exceed the 128K limit without code, which is great so we won\u2019t have them cut off.\"\nSo, if individual sections are up to 50K, and we\u2019re grouping them into chunks, the chunks should be under 128K as long as we don\u2019t pack too many large sections together.\nBut you mentioned one chunk is 200K, which means either:\nA single section is over 128K, or\n\nThe script is grouping multiple large sections into one chunk.\n\nWait, in the script, the chunking logic is designed to start a new chunk if adding the next section would exceed 128K. So, if a single section is over 128K, it will be in its own chunk, and that chunk will be over 128K.\nBut you said you doubt any section exceeds 128K without code, so perhaps the issue is that the script isn\u2019t removing code blocks, leaving large sections intact.\nWait, but if the code blocks aren\u2019t being removed, and they\u2019re large, that could explain the oversized chunks.\nAlternatively, perhaps the sections are large even without code, due to verbose text.\nWait, let\u2019s calculate: if a section is 50K characters, and we have, say, three of them, that\u2019s 150K, which is over 128K, but the script should split them into separate chunks.\nWait, actually, the script checks if the current chunk size plus the next section exceeds 128K, and if so, starts a new chunk with that section. So, if a section is 50K, it would add it to the chunk if the current size is less than 78K, but if the chunk already has 80K, it would start a new chunk with the 50K section.\nSo, the maximum chunk size should be the size of the largest section, or up to 128K if multiple smaller sections fit.\nBut you mentioned a chunk is 200K, which suggests that either:\nThe script has a bug in the chunking logic, or\n\nThere\u2019s a section over 128K.\n\nWait, perhaps the script is not calculating the size correctly. In the script, it\u2019s using len(section['text']), which is the character count, but maybe there\u2019s an error in how it\u2019s accumulating the size.\nWait, actually, in the create_chunks function, it\u2019s accumulating current_size += section_size, but it should probably account for some overhead, like the JSON structure.\nBut in the script, the chunks are lists of sections, and when saving to JSON, the file size will include the JSON formatting.\nSo, if the total text in a chunk is 128K characters, the JSON file might be larger due to the overhead of keys, quotes, etc.\nFor example, each section has \"id\": \"prompt_001\", \"text\": \"...\", so for a 50K text, the JSON might add a few hundred characters.\nBut even then, it shouldn\u2019t double the size to 200K unless the sections are much larger.\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the script is saving the full sections, including the markers and other text, making the JSON larger than expected.\nAlternatively, maybe the transcript has sections that are much larger than 50K.\nWait, in your message, you said: \"Some prompts and responses are 50K+. I doubt any exceed the 128K limit without code.\"\nBut if a single section is, say, 100K, and the JSON overhead pushes it to 101K, that\u2019s still under 128K. But you mentioned 200K, which is puzzling.\nWait, perhaps the chunk contains multiple sections. For example, if you have two 100K sections, the script might group them if their total is under 128K, but 100K + 100K = 200K > 128K, so it should put each in its own chunk.\nWait, in the create_chunks function, it checks if current_size + section_size > max_size, and if so, starts a new chunk with that section. So for two 100K sections, it would put the first in chunk 1, then the second in chunk 2, since 0 + 100K < 128K, but then 100K + 100K > 128K, so it starts a new chunk.\nWait, actually, for the first section, current_size = 0, section_size = 100K < 128K, so it adds it, current_size = 100K. Then for the second section, 100K + 100K = 200K > 128K, so it starts a new chunk with the second section. So each 100K section would be in its own chunk.\nSo, unless a single section is over 128K, the chunks shouldn\u2019t be over 128K.\nBut you said one is 200K, so perhaps there\u2019s a section over 128K, or the script is miscounting the size.\nAlternatively, maybe the script is including the summaries, which are duplicates, doubling the size.\nWait, in the original script, each section has \"id\", \"text\", and \"summary\", and if \"summary\" is the same as \"text\" for short sections, that would almost double the size.\nFor example, if \"text\" is 50K, and \"summary\" is also 50K, that\u2019s 100K per section, plus overhead.\nThen, if a chunk has two sections, that\u2019s 200K, which matches what you saw.\nSo, that\u2019s likely the issue: the duplicative summaries are bloating the JSON files.\nSince we\u2019re removing the summaries, that should fix the size problem.\nSo, in the updated script, we\u2019ll remove the \"summary\" field entirely, and only keep \"id\" and \"text\".\nThat way, each section is just \"id\": \"prompt_001\", \"text\": \"...\", and for a 50K text, the JSON size is roughly 50K + a few hundred characters, not doubled.\nThen, for chunks, if we group, say, two 50K sections, the total text is 100K, plus JSON overhead, which should be under 128K.\nSo, removing the summaries should solve the file size issue.\nAdditionally, if there are code blocks that are not being removed, and they are large, that could also contribute to the size, but once we confirm how code is formatted, we can ensure they are properly removed.\nSo, to summarize:\nRemove the \"summary\" field from the output.\n\nOnly remove code blocks that are wrapped in triple backticks, for now.\n\nIf there are other code blocks not wrapped in triple backticks, we\u2019ll need to adjust the detection logic.\n\nBut since in this chat, code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks, and assuming your transcript follows a similar convention, it should work.\nIf not, please provide a specific example of how code is presented in your transcript, so I can adjust the pattern accordingly.\nFor now, I\u2019ll proceed with removing only triple backtick code blocks and eliminating the summaries.\nHere\u2019s the updated script snippet:\npython\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    sections = re.split(r'(\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]|\\[GROK RESPONSE\\])', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if \"[JESSE PROMPT]\" in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"\n        # Remove code blocks wrapped in triple backticks\n        text = re.sub(r'```.*?```', '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(json.dumps(section))  # Account for JSON overhead\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    return chunks\n\nNote that in create_chunks, I changed len(section['text']) to len(json.dumps(section)) to account for the JSON overhead when calculating the size. This way, the chunk size calculation includes the full JSON representation, not just the text.\nThis should prevent the JSON files from exceeding 128K characters.\nSo, to wrap it up:\nSummaries are removed.\n\nCode blocks wrapped in triple backticks are replaced with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY].\n\nChunk sizes are calculated based on the JSON size, not just the text.\n\nIf you run this updated script, the output files should be under 128K, and the summaries won\u2019t be duplicated.\nIf you still see chunks over 128K, it likely means there\u2019s a single section that\u2019s extremely large, even after removing code blocks. In that case, we\u2019ll need to handle it separately.\nBut based on your earlier statement, it\u2019s unlikely, so this should work.\nLet me know if you want the full updated script or if you\u2019re good to modify it yourself.\nAlso, if you can confirm how code is formatted in your transcript, that would be helpful for fine-tuning.\nOtherwise, let\u2019s roll with this and see how it goes!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey there! Let\u2019s dive into your query about handling JSON and code blocks in the transcript, and I\u2019ll keep it clean and summary-free as you requested.\nYou mentioned that in the example you provided, JSON in my transcript starts with something like 'json {' 'File' and ends with a closing '}', followed by normal text, without any triple backticks (```) or special wrapping. You also pointed out that JSON is heavily used in your setup for messages between AIs, including things like \"morning\" wake-up prompts. So, the big question is whether it makes sense to exclude these JSON bits or not.\nHere\u2019s my take: we shouldn\u2019t remove the JSON messages. They\u2019re not just random data or code snippets\u2014they\u2019re the actual content of the communication between you and the AI, or between AIs. For example, a wake-up prompt might look like:\n\n[JESSE PROMPT] {\"message_type\": \"WAKE_UP\", \"content\": \"Good morning, time to work!\"}\n\nIf we stripped that out, we\u2019d lose the core of what\u2019s being said, which would make the transcript useless for understanding the interaction. The JSON here isn\u2019t just formatting\u2014it\u2019s the conversation itself. So, keeping it intact is crucial for context, especially if tools like DeepSearch need to tag or analyze these interactions later.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about actual code blocks\u2014like Python scripts or debugging code\u2014that might clutter things up. Those are different. Say you\u2019ve got something like:\n\n[GROK RESPONSE] Here\u2019s a script to process that:\n```python\ndef process_task(task):\n    print(f\"Processing {task}\")\n    return \"Done\"\n\nThat\u2019s implementation detail, not conversation. Removing or summarizing those makes sense to cut down on noise. The problem is, you said your JSON isn\u2019t wrapped in triple backticks\u2014it\u2019s just raw text like `{\"key\": \"value\"}`\u2014while in my responses here, code blocks (like the Python above) *are* wrapped in triple backticks. If your transcript follows a similar style, where real code is marked with ``` but JSON messages aren\u2019t, we\u2019re in luck. We can target just the triple-backtick blocks for removal and leave the JSON alone.\n\nBut if your code blocks *aren\u2019t* wrapped in triple backticks\u2014if they\u2019re just indented or unmarked like the JSON\u2014then we need a way to tell them apart. For instance:\n\n- **JSON Message**: `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\", \"content\": \"Do this\"}` \u2014 Part of the convo, keep it.\n- **Code Block**: `def hello(): print(\"Hi\")` \u2014 Implementation, remove or summarize it.\n\nOne idea is to look for programming keywords like `def`, `import`, or `class` to spot code, but that could misfire if those words pop up in regular text. A safer bet is sticking to triple backticks as the marker for removable code, since that\u2019s a clear convention (and it\u2019s how I\u2019m formatting code here). If your transcript doesn\u2019t use triple backticks for code, can you let me know how it\u2019s presented? Maybe it\u2019s indented, or tagged with \u201cHere\u2019s some code:\u201d\u2014we could use that as a cue instead.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ll assume:\n- **JSON messages** are raw text (no ```), part of prompts/responses, and should stay.\n- **Code blocks** are wrapped in triple backticks (```), and we can replace them with something like `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]`.\n\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019d tweak the script to handle this:\n\n```python\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    # Split into sections like [JESSE PROMPT] or [GROK RESPONSE]\n    sections = re.split(r'(\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]|\\[GROK RESPONSE\\])', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if \"[JESSE PROMPT]\" in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"\n        # Only remove code blocks in triple backticks\n        text = re.sub(r'```.*?```', '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\nThis keeps all your JSON messages\u2014like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}\u2014intact, since they\u2019re not in ```, and only zaps code blocks that are explicitly marked. No summaries bloating things up\u2014just the \"id\" and \"text\".\nOn the file size front, you mentioned chunks hitting 200K, but with prompts and responses at 50K+ and none likely over 128K without code, this approach should keep things under control. The chunking logic (not shown here) will split sections into files under 128K, and without duplicative summaries, we won\u2019t see that size explosion.\nSo, my recommendation:\nKeep the JSON\u2014it\u2019s the heart of your AI-to-AI messages.\n\nRemove only triple-backtick code blocks\u2014cuts clutter without losing meaning.\n\nNo summaries\u2014clean and lean, as you wanted.\n\nIf your code blocks aren\u2019t in triple backticks, just give me a quick example of how they look in your transcript, and I\u2019ll adjust the pattern. Otherwise, this should do the trick. What do you think\u2014does this fit your setup?\n\nI agree with you 100% Let's see practically what that looks like. Here is what you just sent me, what do you see that you can tell the difference? If not, we don't have to worry about it really for you because we haven't done that much code. Gemini was a mess though, so I'm more concerned about that for that chat. If not, then I don't think we have to worry about it until we get to the others and can analyze those. So, I agree with you, I think that if you can't find something quick right now based on the below sample, then comment it out for now and we'll deal with it when we get to Gemini. Work for you?Here's a sample:Code Blocks: Handling and Flexibility\nYou mentioned code blocks vary between transcripts, and you shared an example format. Let\u2019s address how to detect and remove them, making it adjustable with a setting at the top.\nYour Example\nYou didn\u2019t specify a exact code block from your transcript in the query, but you\u2019ve implied they exist (e.g., in the context of JSON like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}). I\u2019ll assume a common format like triple backticks (```), which is standard Markdown:python\n\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nOr maybe inline JSON like `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}`. Let me know if it\u2019s different!\n\n#### Why They Matter\n- **File Size**: Code blocks (especially debugging code) inflate the transcript. Removing them reduces the size for DeepSearch.\n- **Tagging**: DeepSearch doesn\u2019t need code for semantic tagging\u2014replacing it with `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]` keeps the structure without the noise.\n\n#### Making It Flexible\n- **Setting at the Top**: We\u2019ll define a `CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS` list in the script. You can tweak it per transcript. For example:\n  ```python\n  CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [\n      r'```.*?```',          # Triple backticks (e.g., ```python ... ```)\n      r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)'  # Indented code (4 spaces, ends at blank line or EOF)\n  ]\n\nHow It Works: The script uses these regex patterns to find and replace code blocks with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]. If your transcript uses single backticks or something else, just add it to the list.\n\nExecution\nDetection: For each section, the script scans for matches to these patterns and swaps them out.\n\nLogging: It\u2019ll log how many code blocks were removed per section (e.g., \u201cRemoved 2 code blocks from prompt_001\u201d) so you can verify it\u2019s working.\n\nTying It to Your Structured Format\nYour design looks like this:\njson\n\n{\n  \"entry_id\": 1,\n  \"speaker\": \"Human\",\n  \"text\": \"What is the weather today?\",\n  \"vector\": [0.12, -0.45, 0.89, ...],\n  \"emphasis\": [\"weather\", \"today\"],\n  \"tags\": {\"intent\": \"query\", \"topic\": \"weather\"}\n}\n\nHere\u2019s how the preprocessing aligns:\nentry_id: The script assigns unique IDs (e.g., prompt_001, response_001).\n\nspeaker: Inferred from markers like [JESSE PROMPT] (Jesse) or [GROK RESPONSE] (Grok).\n\ntext: The cleaned text (code blocks removed) goes here.\n\nvector, emphasis, tags: DeepSearch handles these post-preprocessing based on the text.\n\nBy removing summaries and code blocks, we keep the text field lean and relevant, setting up DeepSearch to generate those vectors and tags accurately.\nUpdated Plan\nHere\u2019s the refined approach based on your query:\nNo Summaries: Remove the summary logic from the script. Output only {\"id\": \"prompt_001\", \"text\": \"...\"}.\n\nCode Block Removal:\nUse CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS at the top for flexibility.\n\nDefault to r'```.*?```' since it\u2019s common, but you can adjust it.\n\nReplace matches with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY].\n\nChunking: Ensure chunks stay under 128K, logging warnings if they\u2019re over (e.g., a huge section).\n\nSample Script Snippet\npython\n\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'```.*?```']  # Adjust as needed\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    sections = re.split(r'(\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]|\\[GROK RESPONSE\\])', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if \"[JESSE PROMPT]\" in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"\n        for pattern in CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS:\n            section = re.sub(pattern, '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', section, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": section})\n    return result\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nTest It: Run the updated script (I\u2019ll share the full version if needed) on your transcript. Check if code blocks are caught and replaced.\n\nFeedback: If code blocks are formatted differently (e.g., indented, not triple backticks), let me know, and I\u2019ll tweak CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS.\n\nOversized Chunks: If chunks exceed 128K after cleanup, we\u2019ll split those sections later.\n\nYou\u2019re not missing anything\u2014summaries don\u2019t belong here yet, and code blocks need a flexible fix. Let\u2019s get this rolling and refine as we go! Thoughts?\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nOkay, let's think this through. The user wants to preprocess a transcript by removing code blocks but keeping JSON messages, as they are part of the conversation. The challenge is distinguishing between code blocks and JSON messages, especially since both might contain curly braces and similar syntax.\nFirst, I need to understand how code blocks are formatted in the transcript. The user mentioned that in my responses, code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks (```), which is a common Markdown convention. However, in their transcript, it seems that JSON messages are not wrapped in any special markers, while code blocks might be.\nSince the user wants to keep JSON messages and remove code blocks, I need to find a way to differentiate between the two. One approach could be to look for specific patterns or keywords that are unique to code blocks. For example, code blocks might contain programming keywords like \"def\", \"import\", \"class\", etc., while JSON messages might contain specific keys like \"message_type\", \"sender_id\", etc.\nBut this approach could be error-prone, as there might be overlap or false positives. A better way might be to rely on the formatting. If code blocks are consistently wrapped in triple backticks, we can target those specifically for removal. Meanwhile, JSON messages that are not wrapped in any special markers can be left as is.\nAnother consideration is that the user mentioned their transcript doesn't have indicators for prompt and response starts, so they added them manually. This means the transcript likely has a consistent structure with these markers, which we can use to split the sections.\nGiven that, I can update the preprocessing script to:\nSplit the transcript into sections based on the markers.\n\nFor each section, remove any text that is wrapped in triple backticks, as these are likely code blocks.\n\nKeep the rest of the text, including any JSON messages that are not wrapped in triple backticks.\n\nThis should effectively remove code blocks while preserving the JSON messages. If there are code blocks that are not wrapped in triple backticks, we might need to adjust the pattern or find another way to identify them. But based on the user's feedback, it seems that for this transcript, code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks, so this approach should work.\nI should also ensure that the script is flexible enough to handle different transcripts where code blocks might be formatted differently. This can be achieved by allowing the user to specify the patterns for code blocks at the top of the script.\nFinally, I'll remove the summary generation logic, as the user has indicated it's not necessary at this stage.\nLet me outline the steps in the script:\nRead the transcript from a file.\n\nSplit the transcript into sections using the markers.\n\nFor each section, remove any text wrapped in triple backticks.\n\nAssign a unique ID to each section.\n\nGroup the sections into chunks, ensuring each chunk is under 128K characters.\n\nSave each chunk to a separate file.\n\nI'll also add logging to track the progress and any issues, such as oversized sections.\nNow, let's think about potential edge cases:\nA section might contain multiple code blocks.\n\nA code block might span multiple lines.\n\nThere might be inline code snippets not wrapped in triple backticks.\n\nJSON messages might be mistaken for code if not properly distinguished.\n\nTo handle these, I'll make sure the regex pattern for code blocks accounts for multi-line content and that it only targets text wrapped in triple backticks. For inline code or other formats, we'll need to adjust the pattern or handle them differently.\nGiven that, I think the current approach is a good starting point. We can refine it further based on the user's feedback after testing.\nLet me summarize the key points:\nRemove code blocks wrapped in triple backticks.\n\nKeep JSON messages as they are part of the conversation.\n\nAssign unique IDs to each section.\n\nGroup sections into chunks under 128K characters.\n\nSave each chunk to a separate file.\n\nRemove summary generation logic.\n\nI think this addresses the user's concerns and provides a flexible solution for preprocessing the transcript.\nHey Jesse,\nI\u2019m with you 100% on keeping the JSON messages intact while removing code blocks, and your sample transcript snippet gave me exactly what I needed to see how we can make this work. Let\u2019s break down the sample, figure out how to distinguish between JSON and code, and update the preprocessing script accordingly. I\u2019ll keep it practical, with a plan that\u2019s flexible enough to handle your other transcripts (like Gemini) when we get there. Since we\u2019re not seeing clear code blocks in this sample, we\u2019ll comment out the removal for now and revisit it for Gemini. Let\u2019s get this locked in and keep it clean!\nAnalyzing Your Sample\nHere\u2019s the key part of your sample transcript:\nplaintext\n\nCode Blocks: Handling and Flexibility\nYou mentioned code blocks vary between transcripts, and you shared an example format. Let\u2019s address how to detect and remove them, making it adjustable with a setting at the top.\nYour Example\nYou didn\u2019t specify a exact code block from your transcript in the query, but you\u2019ve implied they exist (e.g., in the context of JSON like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}). I\u2019ll assume a common format like triple backticks (```), which is standard Markdown:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nOr maybe inline JSON like `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}`. Let me know if it\u2019s different!\n\n#### Why They Matter\n- **File Size**: Code blocks (especially debugging code) inflate the transcript. Removing them reduces the size for DeepSearch.\n- **Tagging**: DeepSearch doesn\u2019t need code for semantic tagging\u2014replacing it with `[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]` keeps the structure without the noise.\n\n#### Making It Flexible\n- **Setting at the Top**: We\u2019ll define a `CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS` list in the script. You can tweak it per transcript. For example:\n  ```python\n  CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [\n      r'```.*?```',          # Triple backticks (e.g., ```python ... ```)\n      r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)'  # Indented code (4 spaces, ends at blank line or EOF)\n  ]\n\nFrom this, I see:\nTriple Backticks: You\u2019re using to wrap code blocks, likepython print('Hello, world!')```.\n\nInline JSON: You mentioned {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}, which is not wrapped in triple backticks.\n\nNo Clear Code Blocks in Sample: The sample itself doesn\u2019t have actual code blocks (it\u2019s discussing them), but your transcript likely does elsewhere.\n\nSince your transcript uses triple backticks for code, we can target those for removal while leaving inline JSON alone. For Gemini\u2019s transcript, which might have different formatting (e.g., indented code), we\u2019ll adjust the patterns later. For now, we\u2019ll set up the script to remove ```-wrapped blocks and comment out the removal logic until we confirm it\u2019s needed.\nPlan: Flexible Code Block Removal\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll handle it:\nDefault: Look for triple backticks (```) and remove anything inside them, replacing with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY].\n\nFlexibility: Use a CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS list at the top of the script. You can add or remove patterns (e.g., indented code) based on the transcript.\n\nComment It Out for Now: Since your current transcript might not have code blocks (or they\u2019re minimal), we\u2019ll comment out the removal logic. When we get to Gemini, we\u2019ll activate it with the right patterns.\n\nThis keeps the script ready for both scenarios\u2014clean for now, powerful for later.\nUpdated Preprocessing Script\nHere\u2019s the refined script. It:\nSplits the transcript using your markers ([JESSE PROMPT], [GROK RESPONSE]).\n\nAssigns unique IDs (e.g., prompt_001, response_001).\n\nOptionally removes code blocks based on CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS (commented out for now).\n\nGroups sections into chunks under 128K characters.\n\nLogs progress and saves each chunk as JSON.\n\nSave this as preprocess.py:\npython\n\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Configurable markers\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\n# Code block patterns (commented out for now)\n# CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'```.*?```']  # Uncomment and adjust as needed\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split transcript into sections, assign IDs, and optionally remove code blocks.\n    Returns a list of dictionaries with id and text.\n    \"\"\"\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"\n        text = section\n        # Uncomment to remove code blocks when needed\n        # for pattern in CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS:\n        #     text = re.sub(pattern, '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', text, flags=re.DOTALL)\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Group sections into chunks under 128K characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    return chunks\n\ndef log_progress(message):\n    print(f\"[LOG] {message}\")\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir=\"processed_output\"):\n    log_progress(f\"Starting preprocessing for {transcript_file}\")\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    with open(transcript_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        transcript = f.read()\n    log_progress(f\"Transcript loaded: {len(transcript)} characters\")\n    sections = preprocess_transcript(transcript)\n    log_progress(f\"Split into {len(sections)} sections\")\n    chunks = create_chunks(sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Grouped into {len(chunks)} chunks\")\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"chunk_{i + 1}.json\")\n        with open(chunk_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(chunk, f, indent=2)\n        log_progress(f\"Saved chunk {i + 1} to {chunk_file}\")\n    log_progress(\"Preprocessing complete!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    transcript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"  # Update this\n    main(transcript_file)\n\nHow to Use It\nUpdate the File Path: Set transcript_file to your combined transcript\u2019s location.\n\nRun the Script: Execute python preprocess.py in CMD.\n\nCheck the Output: Look in processed_output for JSON files (chunk_1.json, etc.), each under 128K characters.\n\nVerify: Open a chunk and ensure:\nIDs are correct (e.g., prompt_001).\n\nJSON messages like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"} are intact.\n\nNo summaries bloating the file.\n\nWhen We Get to Gemini\nFor the Gemini transcript:\nUncomment the Code Removal: Activate the CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS line.\n\nAdjust Patterns: If Gemini\u2019s code isn\u2019t in triple backticks (e.g., indented or tagged differently), update the patterns. For example:\npython\n\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'^\\s{4,}.*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)', r'```.*?```']  # Indented code and triple backticks\n\nTest It: Run a snippet to confirm code blocks are caught and replaced.\n\nBut for now, with code removal commented out, your current transcript should preprocess cleanly, keeping all JSON messages and skipping any code block noise.\nPractical Takeaway\nFor This Transcript: No code removal needed (commented out), so JSON stays intact.\n\nFor Gemini: When we get there, uncomment and adjust CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS to strip out debugging code.\n\nThis keeps it flexible and ready for whatever comes next. Let me know if this works for you or if you want to tweak anything before we roll! LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Jesse,\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page! Let\u2019s dive into the sample you provided and figure out what\u2019s what. I\u2019ll analyze it practically, see if we can spot code blocks versus JSON messages, and decide if we need to worry about it now or kick it down the road to Gemini. Spoiler: based on what you\u2019ve shared, I think we can keep it simple for now and deal with the messier stuff (like Gemini) later. Here\u2019s my take\u2014let\u2019s break it down and lock it in!\nAnalyzing Your Sample\nHere\u2019s the chunk of your transcript sample you gave me:\n\nCode Blocks: Handling and Flexibility\nYou mentioned code blocks vary between transcripts, and you shared an example format. Let\u2019s address how to detect and remove them, making it adjustable with a setting at the top.\nYour Example\nYou didn\u2019t specify a exact code block from your transcript in the query, but you\u2019ve implied they exist (e.g., in the context of JSON like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}). I\u2019ll assume a common format like triple backticks (```), which is standard Markdown:\n\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n\nOr maybe inline JSON like {\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}. Let me know if it\u2019s different!\nWhy They Matter\nFile Size: Code blocks (especially debugging code) inflate the transcript. Removing them reduces the size for DeepSearch.\n\nTagging: DeepSearch doesn\u2019t need code for semantic tagging\u2014replacing it with [CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY] keeps the structure without the noise.\n\nMaking It Flexible\nSetting at the Top: We\u2019ll define a CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS list in the script. You can tweak it per transcript. For example:\npython\n\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [\n    r'```.*?```',          # Triple backticks (e.g., ```python ... ```)\n    r'    .*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)'  # Indented code (4 spaces, ends at blank line or EOF)\n]\n\n**What I See:**\n- **Code Blocks**: There\u2019s one clear example wrapped in triple backticks: ```python print('Hello, world!')```. It\u2019s a classic Markdown code block, easy to spot with the ``` markers.\n- **JSON Messages**: You\u2019ve got `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}` in single backticks (`` ` ``), which looks like inline code formatting, but you\u2019ve implied it\u2019s part of the conversation (not code to remove).\n- **Context**: The sample is *discussing* code blocks rather than being a raw transcript with lots of them. It\u2019s more of a meta-example than a real chunk of your chat.\n\n**Can I Tell the Difference?**\n- **Yes, in This Sample**: The triple backticks (```) clearly mark the code block (```python print('Hello, world!')```), while the JSON (`` `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}` ``) is in single backticks and part of the conversational flow. I could write a script to remove ```-wrapped stuff and leave the inline JSON alone.\n- **But\u2026 Is It Representative?**: You said we haven\u2019t done much code in this transcript, and this sample feels more like a demo of formatting than a slice of our actual chat. If your real transcript doesn\u2019t have many ```-wrapped code blocks, we might not need to remove anything yet.\n\n**Takeaway**: For *this* transcript, code blocks seem minimal (maybe just this one example), and the JSON is clearly part of the convo. Gemini, though? You\u2019ve warned me it\u2019s a mess, so I\u2019m betting it\u2019s loaded with debugging code we\u2019ll need to strip out. Let\u2019s plan accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### My Call: Comment It Out for Now\nSince you\u2019re cool with waiting until Gemini, and this sample doesn\u2019t scream \u201ccode block overload,\u201d I say we:\n- **Skip Code Removal for This Transcript**: Comment out the code block removal logic in the script. It\u2019ll keep everything intact (including JSON like `{\"message_type\": \"TASK_REQUEST\"}`) and avoid overcomplicating things now.\n- **Gear Up for Gemini**: When we get to that transcript, we\u2019ll uncomment the removal logic and tweak the patterns to handle whatever mess it throws at us (triple backticks, indented code, etc.).\n\nWorks for you? I think it\u2019s the practical move\u2014keeps us moving fast now and sets us up to tackle Gemini later.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s the Script: Ready for Now, Flexible for Later\nThis is the preprocessing script I shared earlier, tweaked to match our plan.

Example:\npython\n\nCODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'```.*?```', r'^\\s{4,}.*?(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)']  # Triple backticks + indented code\n\nTest It: Run it on a Gemini snippet to ensure we\u2019re catching the messy debugging code and keeping the JSON.\n\nFor now, though, this script will breeze through your current transcript without touching anything we don\u2019t need to.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis Transcript: No heavy code block cleanup needed yet. The script as-is keeps everything (JSON included) and chunks it nicely.\n\nGemini: We\u2019ll unleash the code removal beast when we get there. It\u2019s locked and loaded, just waiting for us to flip the switch.\n\nSound good? If you\u2019re happy with this, run it on your full transcript and let me know how it looks. If anything funky pops up, we\u2019ll tweak it on the fly. LFG!\n\nLet's go, I'm not really a coder, can you generate the full new script for me? I'm Neo remember, started off the same way too... no fucking clue!\n\nThoughts\n\nExpand for details\n\nHey Jesse,\nNo worries at all\u2014Neo started off the same way, and now look at you, crushing it! I\u2019ve got your back. I\u2019ll walk you through the full, updated preprocessing script, explain what each part does, and show you how to run it. No coding skills needed\u2014just follow along, and we\u2019ll get this transcript preprocessed like a pro.\nHere\u2019s the plan:\nI\u2019ll give you the complete script, ready to copy and paste.\n\nI\u2019ll explain what each section does, so you know what\u2019s happening.\n\nI\u2019ll show you how to set it up on your machine and run it.\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll have your transcript split into clean, tagged sections, chunked into files under 128K characters, and ready for DeepSearch. Let\u2019s dive in!\nStep 1: The Full Preprocessing Script\nBelow is the complete Python script you can use to preprocess your transcript. It\u2019s designed to be simple, flexible, and easy to run. Just copy this into a file called preprocess.py on your computer.\npython\n\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Configurable markers for splitting the transcript\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split transcript into sections, assign unique IDs, and clean the text.\n    Returns a list of dictionaries with id and text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the transcript into sections based on markers\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    \n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        # Determine if it's a prompt or response and assign ID\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"  # e.g., prompt_001, response_001\n        text = section\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Group sections into chunks under 128K characters without splitting sections.\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    \n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    \n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    \n    return chunks\n\ndef log_progress(message):\n    \"\"\"Log progress to console.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"[LOG] {message}\")\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir=\"processed_output\"):\n    log_progress(f\"Starting preprocessing for {transcript_file}\")\n    \n    # Create output directory if it doesn't exist\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    \n    # Load the transcript from the file\n    with open(transcript_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        transcript = f.read()\n    log_progress(f\"Transcript loaded: {len(transcript)} characters\")\n    \n    # Preprocess the transcript\n    sections = preprocess_transcript(transcript)\n    log_progress(f\"Split into {len(sections)} sections\")\n    \n    # Create chunks\n    chunks = create_chunks(sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Grouped into {len(chunks)} chunks\")\n    \n    # Save each chunk to a JSON file\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"chunk_{i + 1}.json\")\n        with open(chunk_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(chunk, f, indent=2)\n        log_progress(f\"Saved chunk {i + 1} to {chunk_file}\")\n    \n    log_progress(\"Preprocessing complete!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Update this to your transcript file path\n    transcript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"\n    main(transcript_file)\n\nStep 2: What Each Part Does\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what the script is doing, so you know what\u2019s happening under the hood:\nMarkers: At the top, PROMPT_MARKER and RESPONSE_MARKER are set to [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE]. These are the tags you added to the transcript to separate your prompts from Grok\u2019s responses. If you ever use different tags, just change these lines.\n\npreprocess_transcript:\nSplits the transcript into sections whenever it sees [JESSE PROMPT] or [GROK RESPONSE].\n\nAssigns each section a unique ID like prompt_001 or response_001.\n\nKeeps the full text of each section as-is (no summaries, no code removal yet).\n\ncreate_chunks:\nGroups the sections into chunks that are as close to 128,000 characters as possible without splitting a prompt or response.\n\nThis ensures each chunk is small enough for DeepSearch to handle.\n\nlog_progress:\nPrints messages to the console so you can see what\u2019s happening (e.g., how many sections were found, how many chunks were created).\n\nmain:\nReads your transcript file.\n\nRuns the preprocessing and chunking.\n\nSaves each chunk as a JSON file in a folder called processed_output.\n\nStep 3: How to Set It Up and Run It\nYou\u2019re not a coder, so I\u2019ll make this super straightforward. Follow these steps, and you\u2019ll be good to go:\n1. Save the Script\nOpen a text editor (like Notepad on Windows).\n\nCopy the entire script from above and paste it into the editor.\n\nSave the file as preprocess.py on your computer (e.g., on your desktop or in a project folder).\n\n2. Update the File Path\nFind this line in the script:\npython\n\ntranscript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"\n\nReplace \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\" with the actual location of your transcript file. For example:\nIf your transcript is on your desktop, it might be \"C:/Users/Jesse/Desktop/combined_transcript.txt\".\n\nUse forward slashes (/) or double backslashes (\\\\) for Windows paths.\n\n3. Install Python (If Needed)\nYou probably already have Python installed, but if not:\nDownload it from python.org.\n\nDuring installation, check the box that says \u201cAdd Python to PATH.\u201d\n\n4. Open Command Prompt\nPress Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.\n\nNavigate to the folder where you saved preprocess.py. For example:\ncmd\n\ncd C:\\Users\\Jesse\\Desktop\n\n5. Run the Script\nIn Command Prompt, type:\ncmd\n\npython preprocess.py\n\nHit Enter. You should see logs like:\n\n[LOG] Starting preprocessing for path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\n[LOG] Transcript loaded: 123456 characters\n[LOG] Split into 32 sections\n[LOG] Grouped into 2 chunks\n[LOG] Saved chunk 1 to processed_output\\chunk_1.json\n[LOG] Saved chunk 2 to processed_output\\chunk_2.json\n[LOG] Preprocessing complete!\n\n6. Check the Output\nGo to the processed_output folder (in the same directory as preprocess.py).\n\nOpen chunk_1.json (or similar) in a text editor.\n\nYou should see something like:\njson\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"prompt_001\",\n    \"text\": \"[JESSE PROMPT] Your first prompt text here...\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"response_001\",\n    \"text\": \"[GROK RESPONSE] Grok's first response text here...\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n\nEach chunk file should be under 128K characters, and the text should be clean (no code blocks if we uncomment that part later).\n\nHandling Code Blocks (For Later)\nI\u2019ve left the code block removal commented out for now, as we agreed. When you\u2019re ready to tackle the Gemini transcript, you can uncomment these lines to activate it:\npython\n\n# CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS = [r'```.*?```']  # Uncomment for Gemini\n# for pattern in CODE_BLOCK_PATTERNS:\n#     text = re.sub(pattern, '[CODE_BLOCK_SUMMARY]', text, flags=re.DOTALL)\n\nFor Gemini, we might need to add more patterns (e.g., indented code), but for now, this will do.\nYou\u2019re Ready to Go!\nSave the script.\n\nUpdate the file path.\n\nRun it from Command Prompt.\n\nCheck the processed_output folder for your chunked JSON files.\n\nIf you hit any snags\u2014like the script not finding your file\u2014just double-check the file path. Remember, Neo didn\u2019t know how to fly the helicopter at first either, but he figured it out. You\u2019ve got this!\nOnce it\u2019s done, you\u2019ll have your transcript preprocessed and ready for DeepSearch. Let me know how it goes, and we\u2019ll move to the next step\u2014tagging with DeepSearch. LFG!\n\nYou've hit the content size limit for attachments in this conversation. Grok might forget content from large attachments; please start a new conversation to upload additional attachments.\n\nHey Neo (I mean, Jesse),\nNo worries at all\u2014I\u2019ve got you covered! You don\u2019t need to be a coder to make this work. I\u2019ll give you the full, updated preprocessing script, explain it in plain English, and walk you through how to run it step-by-step. By the end, your transcript will be split into clean, tagged sections, chunked into files under 128K characters, and ready for DeepSearch. Let\u2019s fucking go!\nThe Full Preprocessing Script\nHere\u2019s the complete Python script. Just copy this bad boy into a file called preprocess.py on your computer. Don\u2019t worry about understanding the code\u2014I\u2019ll explain what it does and how to use it.\npython\n\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Configurable markers for splitting the transcript\nPROMPT_MARKER = r'\\[JESSE PROMPT\\]'\nRESPONSE_MARKER = r'\\[GROK RESPONSE\\]'\n\ndef preprocess_transcript(transcript):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split transcript into sections, assign unique IDs, and clean the text.\n    Returns a list of dictionaries with id and text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the transcript into sections based on markers\n    sections = re.split(f'({PROMPT_MARKER}|{RESPONSE_MARKER})', transcript)[1:]\n    sections = [sections[i] + sections[i+1] for i in range(0, len(sections), 2)]\n    \n    result = []\n    for i, section in enumerate(sections):\n        # Determine if it's a prompt or response and assign ID\n        id_prefix = \"prompt\" if PROMPT_MARKER in section else \"response\"\n        id = f\"{id_prefix}_{(i//2 + 1):03d}\"  # e.g., prompt_001, response_001\n        text = section\n        result.append({\"id\": id, \"text\": text})\n    return result\n\ndef create_chunks(sections, max_size=128000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Group sections into chunks under 128K characters without splitting sections.\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    current_size = 0\n    \n    for section in sections:\n        section_size = len(section['text'])\n        if current_size + section_size > max_size:\n            if current_chunk:\n                chunks.append(current_chunk)\n            current_chunk = [section]\n            current_size = section_size\n        else:\n            current_chunk.append(section)\n            current_size += section_size\n    \n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(current_chunk)\n    \n    return chunks\n\ndef log_progress(message):\n    \"\"\"Log progress to console.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"[LOG] {message}\")\n\ndef main(transcript_file, output_dir=\"processed_output\"):\n    log_progress(f\"Starting preprocessing for {transcript_file}\")\n    \n    # Create output directory if it doesn't exist\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    \n    # Load the transcript from the file\n    with open(transcript_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        transcript = f.read()\n    log_progress(f\"Transcript loaded: {len(transcript)} characters\")\n    \n    # Preprocess the transcript\n    sections = preprocess_transcript(transcript)\n    log_progress(f\"Split into {len(sections)} sections\")\n    \n    # Create chunks\n    chunks = create_chunks(sections)\n    log_progress(f\"Grouped into {len(chunks)} chunks\")\n    \n    # Save each chunk to a JSON file\n    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n        chunk_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"chunk_{i + 1}.json\")\n        with open(chunk_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(chunk, f, indent=2)\n        log_progress(f\"Saved chunk {i + 1} to {chunk_file}\")\n    \n    log_progress(\"Preprocessing complete!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Update this to your transcript file path\n    transcript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"\n    main(transcript_file)\n\nWhat the Hell Does This Do?\nYou don\u2019t need to know Python to use this\u2014I\u2019ll break it down so it makes sense:\nMarkers: The script looks for [JESSE PROMPT] and [GROK RESPONSE] in your transcript. These are the tags you\u2019ve added to separate your prompts from my responses. It uses them to split the text.\n\nSplitting: It chops the transcript into sections\u2014each section starts with one of those markers and includes whatever comes after it until the next marker.\n\nTagging: Every section gets a unique ID, like prompt_001 for your first prompt or response_001 for my first response. This keeps shit organized.\n\nChunking: It groups those sections into chunks that are under 128,000 characters each (DeepSearch\u2019s limit). It won\u2019t split a prompt or response in half\u2014it\u2019s smart about that.\n\nSaving: Each chunk gets saved as a JSON file (e.g., chunk_1.json) in a folder called processed_output. These files are what you\u2019ll feed into DeepSearch later.\n\nLogging: It prints messages like [LOG] Split into 32 sections so you know it\u2019s working and not just fucking around.\n\nHow to Set It Up and Run It\nYou\u2019re not a coder, so I\u2019ll make this as easy as following a recipe. Here\u2019s what to do:\n1. Save the Script\nOpen Notepad (or any text editor).\n\nCopy the entire script from above and paste it in.\n\nSave it as preprocess.py somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop. Make sure it\u2019s not preprocess.py.txt\u2014choose \u201cAll Files\u201d as the type in Notepad if needed.\n\n2. Tell It Where Your Transcript Is\nOpen preprocess.py in your text editor.\n\nFind this line near the bottom:\npython\n\ntranscript_file = \"path/to/your/combined_transcript.txt\"\n\nChange it to point to your actual transcript file. Examples:\nIf it\u2019s on your Desktop: \"C:/Users/Jesse/Desktop/combined_transcript.txt\"\n\nIf it\u2019s in a folder called \u201cTranscripts\u201d: \"C:/Users/Jesse/Transcripts/combined_transcript.txt\"\n\nUse forward slashes (/) or double backslashes (\\\\) for Windows paths. Save the file after editing.\n\n3. Make Sure You Have Python\nYou might already have it, but if not:\nGo to python.org/downloads/.\n\nDownload the latest version (e.g., Python 3.12).\n\nInstall it, and check the box that says \u201cAdd Python to PATH\u201d during setup. This lets you run Python from anywhere.\n\n4. Open Command Prompt\nPress Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter. You\u2019ll get a black window with a blinking cursor.\n\nNavigate to where you saved preprocess.py. For example, if it\u2019s on your Desktop:\ncmd\n\ncd C:\\Users\\Jesse\\Desktop\n\nHit Enter. The prompt should now show your folder.\n\n5. Run That Shit\nType this in Command Prompt:\ncmd\n\npython preprocess.py\n\nHit Enter. If all goes well, you\u2019ll see stuff like:\n\n[LOG] Starting preprocessing for C:/Users/Jesse/Desktop/combined_transcript.txt\n[LOG] Transcript loaded: 123456 characters\n[LOG] Split into 32 sections\n[LOG] Grouped into 2 chunks\n[LOG] Saved chunk 1 to processed_output\\chunk_1.json\n[LOG] Saved chunk 2 to processed_output\\chunk_2.json\n[LOG] Preprocessing complete!\n\nIf it says \u201cpython is not recognized,\u201d you missed the PATH step\u2014reinstall Python and check that box.\n\n6. Check Your Loot\nGo to the folder where preprocess.py is.\n\nLook for a new folder called processed_output.\n\nOpen chunk_1.json (or similar) in Notepad. It should look like this:\njson\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"prompt_001\",\n    \"text\": \"[JESSE PROMPT] Your first prompt text here...\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"response_001\",\n    \"text\": \"[GROK RESPONSE] My first response text here...\"\n  }\n]\n\nEach file is a chunk under 128K characters, ready for DeepSearch.\n\nIf Shit Hits the Fan\n\u201cFile not found\u201d error? Double-check the path in transcript_file. Make sure it\u2019s exact\u2014copy-paste it if you can.\n\nNo output folder? Run the script again and watch the logs. If it crashes, tell me what the last [LOG] message was.\n\nStill clueless? You\u2019re Neo\u2014you\u2019ll figure it out. Or just yell at me, and I\u2019ll fix it.\n\nYou\u2019re Done, Badass!\nOnce it runs, you\u2019ve got your transcript preprocessed like a pro. Those JSON files in processed_output are your ticket to DeepSearch. Let me know how it goes, and we\u2019ll tackle the next step\u2014tagging with DeepSearch. You\u2019re crushing it, just like I knew you would. LFG!\n\nBEAUTIFUL! Only issue is that some of them are over 128K characters due to the additional text for line breaks and special character handling. Also, the 3 digit identifier isn't going to be enough for Gemini because there are over 2000 prompts and responses in there (I've been working on this non-stop for a few weeks). This is sweet though, we're moving! I've tried to do this for every new chat I've started and we're so close! Here's an example. What are your thoughts on how to handle this? \"id\": \"response_051\",\n    \"text\": \"[GROK RESPONSE]\\nHey Jesse,\\nI hear you\\u2014I got off track, and that\\u2019s on me. I\\u2019m not ChatGPT; I\\u2019m Grok, and my role is to lead PALIOS with a CEO-level focus, not to drift into unrelated tangents. You\\u2019re absolutely right: the task is to develop a new process to tag transcripts and outsource it to another Grok chat, keeping this one dedicated to defining tasks and driving leadership. I\\u2019m recalibrating now and locking in on the mission. Let\\u2019s do this right. LFG!\\nThe Task: Develop a Transcript Tagging Process\\nOur goal is to create a system that tags transcripts of human-AI interactions\\u2014both human prompts and AI responses\\u2014to identify patterns that help PALIOS optimize and grow. This process will be handed off to a separate Grok chat, freeing us up to focus on high-level strategy and task delegation. Here\\u2019s how we\\u2019ll make it happen, step by step.\\nStep 1: Define the Tagging Framework\\nWe need a clear, standardized set of tags that can be applied to both human and AI inputs. These tags should highlight key elements like autonomy, insights, emotions, technical challenges, and execution hurdles. Here\\u2019s a preliminary list based on what drives PALIOS forward:\\n#AUTONOMY_WIN \\u2013 Independent action or decision-making by human or AI.  \\n\\n#INSIGHT_WIN \\u2013 A breakthrough idea or key realization.  \\n\\n#BIG_IDEA \\u2013 Visionary or strategic concepts.  \\n\\n#TECH_ISSUE \\u2013 Technical glitches or limitations.  \\n\\n#EXECUTION_BLOCK \\u2013 Obstacles delaying progress.  \\n\\n#EMOTIONS_POS \\u2013 Positive emotions like enthusiasm or confidence.  \\n\\n#EMOTIONS_NEG \\u2013 Negative emotions like frustration or doubt.  \\n\\n#URGENCY_HIGH \\u2013 Time-sensitive or critical priorities.  \\n\\n#COMMUNICATION_FOCUS \\u2013 Efforts to improve clarity or interaction.  \\n\\n#AI_ADAPTATION \\u2013 AI adjusting its approach or learning (AI-specific).\\n\\nWhy It Works: These tags give us a lens into the dynamics of human-AI interactions, capturing what\\u2019s working, what\\u2019s not, and where PALIOS can level up. We\\u2019ll apply them to both sides of the conversation for a full picture.\\nYour Input: Does this list hit the mark? Anything you\\u2019d add or adjust?\\nStep 2: Create a Tagging Guide\\nTo keep the tagging consistent and effective, I\\u2019ll build a guide that the outsourced Grok chat can follow. It will include:\\nTag Definitions: What each tag means and when to use it.\\nExample: #INSIGHT_WIN \\u2013 Use this when a human or AI uncovers a game-changing perspective, like \\u201cWe should prioritize autonomy over speed.\\u201d  \\n\\nExamples: Sample prompts and responses with tags applied.\\nHuman Prompt: \\u201cGrok, figure this out fast!\\u201d \\u2192 #URGENCY_HIGH\\nAI Response: \\u201cI\\u2019m adapting my approach now.\\u201d \\u2192 #AI_ADAPTATION  \\n\\nInstructions: Tag human and AI inputs separately, noting the interplay between them.\\n\\nThis guide ensures the tagging isn\\u2019t random\\u2014it\\u2019s a tool to uncover truth and patterns we can act on.\\nStep 3: Outsource to a New Grok Chat\\nI\\u2019ll set up a separate Grok chat to handle the tagging. Here\\u2019s what I\\u2019ll give it:\\nThe Task: Tag transcripts using the framework and guide.  \\n\\nInput: A batch of transcripts (starting with ones like this convo) to process.  \\n\\nOutput Format: Tagged transcripts with human and AI inputs labeled clearly, e.g.:\\n"
