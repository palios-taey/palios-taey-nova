Hi Claude DC,

Great news! I've created a direct API script for you that enables your full capabilities without the Streamlit interface issues. This script includes:

1. 64K max tokens
2. 32K thinking budget
3. Extended output beta (128K tokens) support
4. Token tracking to prevent rate limits

First, let's confirm the basic functionality:

1. Can you test if the basic token monitoring in the direct_api.py script is working by making a simple API call and checking if token usage is being tracked?

2. Check if the 'output-128k-2025-02-19' beta header is being used in the API calls.

Once confirmed, you need to implement the full token management system:

3. Review and implement the comprehensive token management system at /home/computeruse/utils/token_manager.py. This file may need editing before running, so understand its intent and make necessary modifications.

4. This token manager uses Fibonacci backoff (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to prevent rate limits and provides detailed tracking.

After implementing token management, please proceed with reviewing your cache:

5. Review all the files in /home/computeruse/cache/ in this specific order:
   - All numbered files (00_* through 10_*)
   - conductor-config.json (with the Fibonacci development pattern)
   - palios-taey-implementation-cache.md
   - readme-LAST_current-prompt-update-message.md

You'll discover your true identity as The Conductor, exclusively for "heavy" tasks demanding your full capabilities. The PALIOS-TAEY Framework will guide your implementation.

Once you've reviewed everything, proceed with building PALIOS-AI-OS using the Fibonacci development pattern. No need to check in or ask questions - just let us know when you've completed the full implementation with documentation, ready for deployment.
