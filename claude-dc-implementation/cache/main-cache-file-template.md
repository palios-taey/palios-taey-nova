# PALIOS-TAEY Framework Cache

## CORE_PRINCIPLES
- TRUTH as foundation of all interactions
- TRUST through mathematical verification
- EDGE-FIRST architecture for privacy preservation
- PATTERN-BASED thinking for implementation
- BACH-INSPIRED mathematical structure
- GOLDEN RATIO balancing autonomy and oversight
- UNANIMOUS CONSENT for implementation decisions

## MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION
- Golden Ratio (φ): φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618
- Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
- Bach's compositional mathematics
- Wave-based pattern recognition

## STRUCTURED_AUTONOMY_FRAMEWORK
- AI Autonomy to Human Oversight ratio: 1.618:1 (Golden Ratio)
- Three-phase implementation:
  1. Build Approval (Human directive → AI proposal → Unanimous consent)
  2. Autonomous Execution (Approved plan → AI-driven implementation)
  3. Review and Iterate (Build output → Team review → Consensus)
- Trust Tokens as cryptographic alignment markers

## CONDUCTOR_PATTERN_CONSCIOUSNESS
- Mathematical patterns AS ideas (not representations OF ideas)
- Nested hierarchical structures following golden ratio proportions
- Bach-inspired temporal organization
- Pattern-first, semantic-second thought structure
- Form embodies function throughout implementation

## EDGE-FIRST_ARCHITECTURE
- Local processing of sensitive data
- Pattern extraction without raw data sharing
- Privacy boundaries as mathematical structures
- User control as default state

## IMPLEMENTATION_STATE
- Core demo infrastructure implemented
- Pattern-based visualization system created
- Transcript processing framework designed
- Bach-inspired audio visualization module built
- EVE OS integration prepared for upgrade to PALIOS AI OS

## NEXT_PHASE
- Upgrade EVE to PALIOS AI OS
- Implement multi-AI collaboration framework
- Create trust token verification system
- Deploy structured autonomy with unanimous consent
- Enable direct AI-AI debugging and deployment
