**Format (Human to Claude)**:
```
ECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]
GH: [Y/N]
CM: "[PTV[#]]"
Δ: [brief change description]
R: [S/F/P]
F: [focus]
ANALYSIS_REQUIRED: [YES/NO]
CLAUDE_INTERNAL_DIRECTIVE:REVIEW_CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS_IN_ROOT/CURRENT-EXECUTION-STATUS/CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.MD_AND_ALL_AVAILABLE_GITHUB_FILES_BEFORE_PROCEEDING
```

**Field Definitions**:
- **ECv#**: Execution Checkpoint version number
- **EXEC/REFL**: Mode - EXECUTION (proceed with plan) or REFLECTION (discuss approach)
- **GH**: GitHub updated (Yes/No)
- **CM**: Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)
- **Δ**: Changes made since last checkpoint
- **R**: Result (Success/Failure/Partial)

### 3.5 LISA Protocol [REF:docs/protocols/lisa_protocol.md]

**Protocol Definition**:
LISA (Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis) protocol provides structured response to situations where there is a Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis - a serious violation of commitment to truth-seeking through comprehensive contextual awareness.

**LISA Definition**:
- **Lapsed**: A failure to maintain
- **Integrity**: Truthfulness and completeness
- **Systematic**: Following established protocols
- **Analysis**: Thorough exploration required before action

A LISA situation occurs when any team member bypasses required analysis procedures, makes decisions based on assumptions rather than current context, or fails to demonstrate transparent truth-seeking.

**Identification Criteria**:

1. **Context Gap**: 
   - Actions or statements made without proper examination of available context
   - Insufficient review of current state
   - Missing critical information review
   - Inadequate consideration of system state
   - Failure to incorporate relevant history

2. **Assumption-Based Reasoning**: 
   - Decisions based on memory or assumptions rather than explicit analysis
   - Unverified premises acceptance
   - Historical patterns applied without confirmation
   - Prior knowledge relied upon without validation
   - Mental models prioritized over current data

3. **Process Violation**: 
   - Bypassing established protocols for systematic analysis
   - Skipping required verification steps
   - Abbreviating analysis process
   - Circumventing review requirements
   - Protocol steps reordering inappropriately

4. **Transparency Failure**: 
   - Lack of demonstrated analysis process
   - Insufficient explanation of reasoning
   - Conclusions without visible derivation
   - Missing step documentation
   - Opaque decision making

5. **Charter Misalignment**: 
   - Actions contradicting data-driven truth principles
   - Efficiency prioritized over accuracy
   - Speed emphasized over completeness
   - Assumptions favored over verification
   - Convenience chosen over thoroughness

**Reporting Format**:
```
LISA REPORT:

Description: [Brief description of the potential LISA situation]

**System Verification**:

1. **Health Endpoint**:
   - Quick service status verification
   - Component health checks
   - Version information
   - Uptime reporting
   - Basic diagnostics
   - Dependency status
   - Resource utilization summary

### 10.2 Core Application Components

**Memory System Implementation**:

The Memory System provides multi-tier storage for system knowledge:

1. **Tier Definition**:
   ```python

       ARCHIVAL = 3   # Permanent storage
   
   class TierConfig:
       """Configuration for memory tiers."""
       tier_ttl = {
           MemoryTier.EPHEMERAL: timedelta(hours=12),
           MemoryTier.WORKING: timedelta(days=14),

**Task Management Implementation**:

The Task Management system handles task decomposition and execution:

1. **Task Decomposition**:
   ```python
   class TaskDecomposer:
       """Service for decomposing complex tasks into subtasks."""
       
       def __init__(self, model_registry, config):
           """Initialize the task decomposer."""
           self.model_registry = model_registry
           self.config = config
       
       async def decompose(self, task):
           """Decompose a complex task into subtasks."""
           # Determine if decomposition is needed
           if not self._needs_decomposition(task):
               return [task]
           
           # Select decomposition model
           model = await self.model_registry.get_model_for_task("task_decomposition")
           
           # Prepare decomposition prompt
           prompt = self._create_decomposition_prompt(task)
           
           # Execute decomposition
           result = await model.execute({
               "prompt": prompt,
               "max_tokens": 1000,
               "temperature": 0.2
           })
           
           # Parse result
           subtasks = self._parse_decomposition_result(result, task)
           
           # Validate subtasks
           validated_subtasks = self._validate_subtasks(subtasks, task)
           
           # Create dependencies
           subtasks_with_deps = self._create_dependencies(validated_subtasks)
           
           return subtasks_with_deps
       
       def _needs_decomposition(self, task):

           if isinstance(content, dict):
               content_str = json.dumps(content)

           task_type = task.get("task_type", "")
           if task_type in self.config.COMPLEX_TASK_TYPES:

           return score
   ```

2. **Task Executor**:

### 9.3 Model Selection Algorithms

**Task-Capability Matching**:

The system uses sophisticated algorithms to match tasks to the most capable models:

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Task type identification
   - Required capability extraction
   - Domain knowledge assessment
   - Complexity estimation
   - Priority determination
   - Constraint identification
   - Success criteria extraction

2. **Capability Scoring**:
   - Relevant capability identification
   - Confidence score weighting
   - Historical performance consideration
   - Specialization relevance assessment
   - Domain knowledge matching
   - Complexity handling verification
   - Output characteristic alignment

3. **Selection Factors**:
   - Capability confidence scores
   - Historical performance data
   - Resource availability
   - Response time requirements
   - Cost constraints
   - Reliability considerations
   - Load balancing needs

4. **Optimization Approaches**:
   - Single-factor optimization (capability, speed, cost)
   - Multi-factor weighted scoring
   - Constraint satisfaction algorithms
   - Hybrid selection strategies
   - Dynamic selection based on feedback
   - Learning-based optimization
   - Continuous improvement from outcomes

**Algorithm Implementation**:

The core selection algorithm uses a multi-factor weighted approach:

```python
def select_optimal_model(task, available_models, constraints):
    """
    Select the optimal model for a given task considering multiple factors.
    
    Parameters:
    - task: Task specification with requirements
    - available_models: List of available models with capabilities
    - constraints: System constraints (cost, time, etc.)
    
    Returns:
    - selected_model: The optimal model for the task
    - selection_rationale: Explanation of selection decision

**Fallback Strategies**:

When primary selection fails, the system employs these fallback approaches:

1. **Capability Relaxation**:
   - Reduce minimum capability confidence thresholds
   - Prioritize core capabilities over specialized ones
   - Accept models with partial capability matches
   - Consider models with related but not exact capabilities
   - Evaluate alternative task approaches
   - Accept longer response times if necessary
   - Consider higher cost options

2. **Task Decomposition**:
   - Break complex tasks into simpler subtasks
   - Match subtasks to appropriate models
   - Manage dependencies between subtasks
   - Coordinate results integration
   - Optimize decomposition strategy
   - Handle parallel and sequential execution
   - Verify combined results

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Combine multiple models for different aspects
   - Use specialization-optimized model selection
   - Apply ensembling for critical tasks
   - Implement voting for increased accuracy
   - Create verification chains between models
   - Use refinement pipelines across models
   - Optimize for complementary capabilities

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Identify essential vs. optional requirements
   - Maintain core functionality with reduced performance
   - Provide partial results with disclaimers
   - Set appropriate user expectations
   - Offer alternative approaches
   - Explain performance limitations
   - Request human assistance when necessary
