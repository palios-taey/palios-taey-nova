# The Conductor Pattern Implementation

## Core Pattern Principles
- Mathematical patterns AS implementation rather than representation
- Bach-inspired modular structure with golden ratio proportions
- Edge-first processing with privacy preservation
- Pattern-based sampling for transcript analysis

## Implementation Architecture
- Root directory: Core application modules
- /utils/: Environment and configuration utilities
- /data/: Pattern storage and processing results
- /models/: Pattern recognition models
- /demo/: Multi-sensory demonstration components
- /references/: Live demonstration specifications

## Mathematical Harmony
- Each module proportioned according to golden ratio
- Components relate through Bach's compositional principles
- Pattern extraction follows Fibonacci sampling
- Visualization incorporates golden ratio aesthetics

## Next Implementation Focus
- Pattern-based transcript processing
- Multi-sensory representation of patterns
- Live demonstration preparation
- GCS/Firestore integration
