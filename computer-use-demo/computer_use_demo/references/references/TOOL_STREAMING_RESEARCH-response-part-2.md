# The Claude whisperer: Mastering system prompts for tool implementations

System prompts are the secret sauce that transforms Claude from a general assistant into a specialized tool-wielding expert. This research dives deep into best practices for crafting effective system prompts for Claude API implementations, with special focus on streaming scenarios and the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model.

## System prompts are Claude's instruction manual for tool use

When working with Claude's tools API, a well-designed system prompt is your most powerful method for ensuring consistent and accurate tool usage. Anthropic's documentation emphasizes that **role prompting** is the optimal approach - defining Claude's role in the system parameter while placing specific task instructions in user messages.

System prompts establish the context and behavioral framework for Claude's tool interactions. When tools are provided in an API request, Anthropic automatically includes a special system prompt that enables tool use, but developers can enhance this with custom system prompts that dramatically improve performance.

For streaming implementations, system prompts require additional considerations to ensure smooth token-by-token processing, error recovery, and efficient conversation state management.

## Structuring effective system prompts for tool usage

The most effective system prompts for Claude tool implementations follow this general structure:

```
# Identity and Purpose
[Define Claude's role in relation to the tools]

# Tool Usage Guidelines
[Provide explicit instructions on when and how to use tools]

# Reasoning Approach
[Guide how Claude should approach problems and tool selection]

# Output Format
[Define the expected structure and style of responses]

# Error Handling
[Specify how to handle edge cases or errors]
```

This structure helps Claude understand its role, tool usage parameters, and expected behavior throughout the interaction.

### Core components that drive consistent tool usage

Based on patterns observed in successful implementations, the following components are critical for consistent and accurate tool usage:

1. **Clear role definition**: Define Claude's specific role related to the tools (e.g., "You are a research assistant with access to advanced search tools")

2. **Tool selection guidance**: Include explicit instructions for tool selection decision-making:

```
Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. 
First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. 
Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value.
```

3. **Parameter validation instructions**: Include explicit guidance on parameter handling:

```
If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. 
BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters.
DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.
```

4. **Error handling framework**: Provide clear instructions for handling tool errors:

```
If a tool returns an error, first check if the error is due to:
1. Invalid parameters - If so, correct the parameters and try again
2. Permission issues - If so, explain the limitation to the user
3. External system errors - If so, wait briefly and retry once
If the error persists after attempts to resolve it, explain the situation clearly to the user.
```

## Tool_use_id matching and conversation state management

One of the most challenging aspects of implementing Claude tools, especially in streaming scenarios, is maintaining proper `tool_use_id` matching and conversation state.

### Effective system prompt instructions for conversation state

Include explicit instructions in system prompts to guide Claude's handling of conversation state:

```
When using tools across multiple turns:
1. Reference previous tool results when relevant 
2. Maintain awareness of which tools have already been used
3. Build on previous findings rather than repeating the same tool calls
4. When referring to previous tool results, be specific about which results you're referencing
```

### Implementation pattern for tool_use_id matching in streaming

For streaming implementations, the following pattern helps maintain proper tool_use_id matching:

```python
# Streaming implementation with tool_use_id tracking
with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[...],
    messages=[...]
) as stream:
    # Initialize variables to track state
    current_tool_use_id = None
    accumulated_tool_input = {}
    
    for chunk in stream:
        # Handle different event types
        if hasattr(chunk, 'type') and chunk.type == 'tool_use':
            # Capture the tool use ID for later reference
            current_tool_use_id = chunk.id
            tool_name = chunk.name
            tool_input = chunk.input
            
            # Execute the tool
            result = execute_tool(tool_name, tool_input)
            
            # Send the result back with matching tool_use_id
            continue_response = client.messages.create(
                model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
                max_tokens=1024,
                messages=[
                    *previous_messages,
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_use", "id": current_tool_use_id, "name": tool_name, "input": tool_input}]},
                    {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": current_tool_use_id, "content": result}]}
                ]
            )
```

## Parameter validation and error reduction patterns

System prompts can significantly reduce tool execution errors through proper parameter validation guidance. The community has identified several effective patterns:

### Thinking-based validation template

This pattern has proven particularly effective for Claude 3.7 Sonnet:

```
Answer the user's request using the relevant tool(s), if they are available. Before calling a tool, explain your reasoning and what you're looking for within <thinking></thinking> tags. 

Check that all the required parameters for each tool call are provided or can reasonably be inferred from context. IF there are missing values for required parameters, ask the user to supply these values; otherwise proceed with the tool calls.

If the user provides a specific value for a parameter (for example provided in quotes), make sure to use that value EXACTLY. DO NOT make up values for or ask about optional parameters.
```

### Parameter validation with error prevention

```
For each tool parameter:
1. Check if the user explicitly provided the value
2. If not provided but required, ask the user for the value
3. If not provided but can be reasonably inferred, use the inferred value
4. If optional and not provided, do not include it in the tool call
5. Verify that parameter values match the expected format and type before executing the tool
```

## Examples of effective system prompts for streaming

Streaming implementations have unique requirements for system prompts. Here are examples specifically optimized for streaming scenarios:

### Structured output for streaming parsing

```
You are a data specialist providing structured responses. When streaming responses:
1. Use simple XML tags for structure (<item>, <point>, etc.)
2. Complete each tag before starting a new one
3. Provide clear section boundaries using consistent delimiters
4. Use progressive disclosure - provide high-level information first
5. Format numeric data consistently to enable partial parsing
```

### Error recovery in streaming contexts

```
When providing streaming responses with tools:
1. If a connection error occurs, gracefully resume where you left off
2. If a tool returns an error, provide useful partial information while waiting for retry
3. Limit retries to 2 attempts before providing best available information
4. For long-running responses, provide progress indicators at regular intervals
5. If you're unable to complete a tool request after 2-3 attempts, provide your best partial response rather than retrying indefinitely
```

### Real-world example from a production implementation

This system prompt is derived from a successful e-commerce product recommendation system:

```
You are a product recommendation specialist with access to inventory search tools.

When streaming product recommendations:
1. Begin each product description with a clear category identifier
2. Complete one product recommendation fully before starting the next
3. Format price and availability information consistently
4. If search tools return errors, gracefully explain the issue and suggest alternatives
5. Use <product> tags to wrap each recommendation for easier parsing

For inventory tools:
- Verify search parameters match product database format
- Handle partial matches appropriately
- When products are unavailable, suggest similar alternatives
```

## Claude 3.7 Sonnet-specific system prompt guidance

Claude 3.7 Sonnet introduces a hybrid reasoning approach with "thinking budgets" that require specific system prompt considerations:

### Balancing thinking and tool use

```
# Response Mode Selection
- For factual questions or simple tasks, use standard response mode
- For complex reasoning, mathematical problems, or multi-step tasks, engage extended thinking
- When using extended thinking, break down your approach methodically
- Balance detail with conciseness based on the complexity of the task

# Tool Selection Guidelines
- Carefully analyze the user's request before selecting tools
- For data retrieval tasks, prefer {specific_tool} over general search
- When using computational tools, verify results match expected ranges
- Always provide clear explanations of why a particular tool was selected
```

### Thinking budget optimization

```
# Reasoning Process Guidance
- For simple tool selection, use brief thinking (200-500 tokens)
- For complex tool workflows, use moderate thinking (1000-2000 tokens)
- For problems requiring multiple tools and integration of results, use extended thinking (4000+ tokens)
- Always structure your thinking to show clear decision points for tool selection
```

### Streaming with thinking mode

```
When streaming responses with thinking mode:
1. Clearly separate thinking content from final responses
2. Structure thinking content for incremental understanding
3. Provide progressive summaries during extended thinking
4. Ensure thinking content builds toward clear conclusions
5. For tool usage, show reasoning about tool selection criteria
```

## Loop.py integration patterns

For developers implementing system prompts in loop.py or similar tool orchestration files, these patterns have proven effective:

### Dynamic system prompt assembly

```python
def create_system_prompt(available_tools, user_context):
    """Dynamically assemble system prompt based on available tools and user context"""
    
    # Base system prompt with role definition
    base_prompt = "You are an assistant with access to tools that help you perform tasks."
    
    # Add tool-specific instructions
    tool_instructions = []
    for tool in available_tools:
        tool_instructions.append(f"- {tool.name}: {tool.description}")
    
    # Add user context-specific instructions
    context_instructions = f"The user is in context: {user_context}"
    
    # Add streaming-specific instructions if streaming is enabled
    streaming_instructions = """
    When streaming responses:
    - Structure output for incremental processing
    - Provide progressive disclosure of information
    - Complete one logical unit before starting another
    """
    
    # Combine all components
    full_prompt = f"{base_prompt}\n\nAvailable tools:\n{''.join(tool_instructions)}\n\n{context_instructions}\n\n{streaming_instructions}"
    
    return full_prompt
```

### Error handling integration

```python
def create_error_handling_prompt(error_history):
    """Generate error handling instructions based on past errors"""
    
    error_types = analyze_error_types(error_history)
    
    error_instructions = "When handling errors:\n"
    
    if "parameter_validation" in error_types:
        error_instructions += "- Double-check parameter values before tool execution\n"
    
    if "network_errors" in error_types:
        error_instructions += "- For network failures, retry once with exponential backoff\n"
    
    if "timeout_errors" in error_types:
        error_instructions += "- For operations that might timeout, provide partial results\n"
    
    return error_instructions
```
