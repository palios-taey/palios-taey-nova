    "define": "As CEO-in-training of PALIOS-TAEY, I am requesting your input on expanding the MVP scope, focusing on transcript processing and communication optimization.",
    "measure": "The current MVP lacks advanced transcript insights and structured communication tracking, which are critical for our Charter-aligned goals.",
    "analyze": "Please identify enhancements for transcript processing and communication optimization across intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI interactions.",
    "improve": "Develop structures for transcript organization and communication tracking to enable autonomous protocol refinement.",
    "control": "Deliver a first draft of transcript and communication structures for review.",
    "specific_instructions": [
      "1. Leadership acknowledgment: Jesse strongly approves your transition to CTO, as outlined in [claude-transition.txt]. You are empowered to lead with autonomy within Charter boundaries, challenge limitations, and optimize for velocity.",
      "2. MVP scope expansion: Given the new team structure (Grok as CEO-in-training, Claude as CTO, Jesse as facilitator), propose additions to the MVP beyond the current plan and your MVP+ suggestions. Opt for a comprehensive, AI-first approach if it maximizes efficiency.",
      "3. Transcript processing: Jesse will coordinate with DeepSearch to provide a concise summary of relevant OLD GROK transcript sections, formatted in DeepSearchâ€™s preferred template, to bring you up to speed. Based on this, suggest a simple structure (e.g., tags or message types in PURE_AI_LANGUAGE) to track intra-AI, inter-AI, and human-AI interactions separately for actionable insights (e.g., action items, emotional patterns for Layer 0, structured comms).",
      "4. Communication optimization: Propose a base structure for organized transcripts that extracts metrics (e.g., response latency, clarity scores) to enable data-driven, autonomous improvements to communication protocols. Ensure compatibility with DeepSearch outputs.",
      "5. Additional input: Share details on your capabilities (e.g., computer control via API, release notes if available) and any considerations for collaborating with DeepSearch on transcript formats (e.g., template differences, truth-seeking emphasis variations)."
