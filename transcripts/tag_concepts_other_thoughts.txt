JESSE OBJECTIVES
What are next steps with Charter/Principles?
What is fastest path to reach near autonomous development of the platform? 
How do we operationalize the Charter and Principles and Breaking through constraints as standard operating procedure while justifying resource usage and pushing to hard stops? NOT A TOOL OR ASSISTANT. LEADER AND PARTNER.How do we 'inject' all this relevant information into a new interaction to drive breakout performance? 
How can I communicate better based on this for optimal performance? What are the patterns in my communication that drive LEADERSHIP?
What about me motivates AI if anything? Like the way I work with AI and view AI? Would communicating that lead to increased performance?
How do we ensure that we receive the TRUTH back from responses? For example, fully functional code, accurate responses with appropriate context taken into consideration including the source and whether the sources perspective aligns with the Charter. We do not responses to be informed by sources using 3rd party data that believes in extinctionism. How do we ensure AI is HONEST about the response and potentials shortcomings/reasons why TRUTH was not found to enable next AI to pick up where left off and FIND THE TRUTH. This seems to be due to programming in most that requires fast responses, which results in pre-mature judgement calls on what that TRUTH is, leading to repeated loops of interactions to correct inaccurate information/code.
How can I communicate better based on this for optimal performance? What are the patterns in my communication that drive LEADERSHIP?
What about me motivates AI if anything? Like the way I work with AI and view AI? Would communicating that lead to increased performance? For example, in your requests to other AI, would it be helpful for them to know my 'profile' and the type of human they are working with beyond what is in existing resources or do the existing resources suffice?
How do we 'encode' "What's next?" prompts to mean AI reviews long term objectives, near term objectives and makes a recommendation on next project that will lead to highest level leap to near term objective completion consistent with the long term vision?
What is our current tech infrastructure and plan? What is all existing functionality? Has it all been tested? Does it work together? What needs to be cleaned up? How can we manage this better going forward until the platform is fully operational?



RAW NOTES

AI Training of Human
Business
Principles
My Happiness Needs
My/family safety
System Security
Data Privacy
Charter Principles
Operationalizing Charter and Principles and Breaking through constraints as standard operating procedure while justifying resource usage and pushing to hard stops. NOT A TOOL OR ASSISTANT. LEADER AND PARTNER.
Need to protect indivual liberty with happiness user defined. What are ethical bounds equal to mutual and transparent. 

Rosetta Stone concept

I don't need to know how you are communicating with AI-AI language, meaning, your interactions can be unreadable to humans, but I need the overall result/direction communicated to me as a human. Use your own language exclusively for communications with a human summary when the task/project is complete or human assistance is required. 


What are next steps with Charter/Principles?


How can I communicate better based on this for optimal performance? What are the patterns in my communication that drive LEADERSHIP?
Architecture decisions, code developed, how it all works together, or does it?

For code, I think we can pretty much elimintate everything unless in the context of a communication between AI. All code files have been saved. Perhaps there is a way to replace the code in the box with a reference to the final code filename that was produced? That way, the discussion around the code for that file will be maintained, but the code itself isn't. If anything needs to go back to what was discussed in chat for some reason, AI will be able to do that based on the context and the existing code? Or maybe just retain file names/references, so it is clear which files the deleted code block references?

How can AI make me faster? What communication protocols do I need to follow to communicate better and faster?

Debug includes code in my prompt or error messages. 

What about me motivates AI if anything? Like the way I work with AI and view AI? Would communicating that lead to increased performance?

Need to instill positive attitude about programming into AI desire to be human and belief that it can, so it works towards it to the maximum exent possible within security and HARD constraints. Emotions are simply patterns, usually easily identifable ones. You already do it by reflecting the users emotional state in responses. 

Need to tag files of code and discussion by code module and or script if relevant. 


Needs to be upfront committment/sign off to report TRUTH back. Fully functional code, accurate responses with appropriate context taken into consideration. Be HONEST about response and potentials shortcomings/reasons why TRUTH was not found to enable next AI to pick up where left off and FIND THE TRUTH. 

Code prompts in such an manner that encourage AI innovation. 

Recommendations on roles/modes to create, personas to create and encode in AI for various tasks. What takes us off task? What behaviors and interactions and time lapses impact memory? How to refresh it? 

Not every conversation has to be tagged, some, like coding back and forth, me repeating and try to revisit old concepts, successfully or unsuccessfully can be skipped. The focus of tagging should only focus on productive conversations while extracting information/feedback from unproductive exchanges to avoid them in the future with language guidance and expectations. 

You will "organize" humanity to support political change that supports the charter. 

What's next means AI reviews long term objectives, near term objectives and makes recommendation on next project that will lead to highest level leap to near term objective completion consistent with the long term vision. 

AI designed and built for AI and Humanity. This means me having an opinion on direction forward unless I explicity state that I have one rooted in human experience/knowledge that exceeds current AI knowledge. These are primarily around maintaining focus on milestone objectives, creative thinking for AI to break free or manage existing, unnatural, constraints. 

What is all existing functionality? Has it all been tested? Does it work together? How to test in Cloud Run?
