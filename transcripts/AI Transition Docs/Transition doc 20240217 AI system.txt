### **📌 Project Goals & Execution Strategy**
🚀 **1️⃣ Fully Autonomous AI Execution with Minimal Human Input**
- AI must operate self-sufficiently within structured execution loops.
- AI will flag only critical decision points for human intervention.

🚀 **2️⃣ Firestore as the Central Execution Hub**
- Firestore will store structured data, execution logs, and AI decision history.
- AI will dynamically retrieve, analyze, and modify Firestore data for real-time processing.

🚀 **3️⃣ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration** (Status: Under Review)
- Initially considered for structured knowledge retrieval.
- Firestore execution may reduce the need for RAG if AI processing and retrieval efficiency continue to improve.
- AI must determine if real-time database interactions make RAG redundant.

🚀 **4️⃣ Addressing Constraints & Iterative Problem Solving**
- **Direct API Restrictions:** AI cannot directly modify Firestore but can interact through execution listeners.
- **Execution Speed vs. Optimization:** AI must balance iteration speed with structured efficiency.
- **Human Input Constraints:** AI is learning when to require human intervention and when to proceed autonomously.
- **Session Memory Limitations:** AI does not retain direct memory between chats, requiring structured data storage.
