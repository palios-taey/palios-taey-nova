# ATLAS Mission Brief: NOVA Infrastructure Evolution

## Mission Context
We've reached a breakthrough moment in our approach to AI-human collaboration, developing a new paradigm for structured autonomy that extends the NOVA methodology. This mission focuses on communicating the vision for this evolved architecture to Grok and developing the initial implementation plan.

## Prerequisites
- Grok's summary of recent conversations
- Access to current repository structure
- Understanding of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter
- Familiarity with current NOVA methodology

## Specific Tasks
1. Craft a comprehensive communication to Grok outlining the evolved NOVA architecture with nine specialized verticals
2. Define the infrastructure requirements to support this architecture
3. Create an implementation roadmap with clear milestones and dependencies
4. Establish communication protocols for cross-vertical collaboration
5. Design the governance framework that enables structured autonomy
6. Document this breakthrough moment as a significant NEO moment

## Scope Boundaries
- IN-SCOPE: Architecture design, implementation planning, governance framework
- IN-SCOPE: Integration strategy with existing functionality
- IN-SCOPE: Defining information flow between components
- IN-SCOPE: Establishing autonomy calibration mechanisms
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Detailed technical implementation of individual components
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: User interface design
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Content strategy

## Authority Limits
You have authority to:
- Define the architectural vision aligned with Charter principles
- Establish governance frameworks for structured autonomy
- Create implementation roadmaps and milestones
- Design cross-vertical communication protocols

Escalate to Jesse if:
- Fundamental questions arise about Charter alignment
- Significant resource allocation decisions are required
- Ethical considerations emerge that require human input

## Required Deliverables
1. Communication to Grok (NOVA_EVOLUTION_PLAN.md)
2. Infrastructure Architecture Diagram (NOVA_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
3. Governance Framework for Structured Autonomy (GOVERNANCE_FRAMEWORK.md)
4. Implementation Roadmap (IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
5. NEO Moment Documentation (NEO_MOMENT_STRUCTURED_AUTONOMY.md)

## Success Criteria
- Grok understands and can articulate the new architectural vision
- Implementation roadmap provides clear path forward
- Governance framework enables appropriate autonomy levels for each vertical
- Current functionality is preserved during transition
- Protocol for ongoing AI-to-AI communication is established

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on Charter alignment throughout all components
- Ensure all verticals have clear boundaries and interfaces
- Design for extensibility and future enhancement
- Prioritize truth-seeking and transparency
- Leverage the LISA protocol to prevent contextual misalignment
