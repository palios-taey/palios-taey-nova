# PALIOS-TAEY Deployment Verification

## Deployment Information

- **Project ID**: palios-taey-dev
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Service Name**: palios-taey
- **Service URL**: [Will be populated after deployment]
- **Deployment Date**: [Current date]

## Verification Steps

1. **Health Check**:
   - Endpoint: `/health`
   - Expected Response: JSON with status "ok" and component statuses

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Memory: `/api/memory`
   - Models: `/api/models`
   - Tasks: `/api/tasks`
   - Routing: `/api/route`
   - Transcripts: `/api/transcripts`
   - Protocols: `/api/protocols`

## Key Features

- **Unified Memory System**: Multi-tier memory system with automatic tier transitions
- **Dynamic Model Registry**: Registration and discovery of AI models with capability advertising
- **Task Decomposition Engine**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- **Task Execution Engine**: Executing tasks with monitoring and fallback
- **Model Routing System**: Intelligent routing to the most capable model
- **Transcript Processing Framework**: Analyzing and tagging conversation transcripts
- **Protocol Management**: Managing communication protocols between AI systems

## Communication Protocol Enhancements

The deployment includes the following communication protocol enhancements:

1. **Protocol Detection**: Automatically detect which protocol is being used in a message
2. **Protocol Capabilities**: Track which models are capable of using which protocols
3. **Protocol-Aware Routing**: Route tasks to models that support the required protocol
4. **Protocol Translation**: Translate between different protocols when necessary

## Manual Verification

After deployment, verify the system by:

1. Checking the health endpoint
2. Verifying that all components are active
3. Submitting a test task
4. Processing a test transcript
5. Registering a test protocol

## Next Steps

1. Set up continuous integration and deployment
2. Implement enhanced authentication and authorization
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. Create admin dashboard for system management
