# ATLAS Mission Brief: Documentation Restructuring & Quality Framework Implementation

## Mission Context
We have successfully deployed the initial PALIOS-TAEY system but encountered significant challenges with documentation organization and code quality. This mission focuses on implementing a comprehensive documentation restructuring and quality assurance framework to improve knowledge transfer, reduce defects, and increase development velocity.

## Prerequisites
- Access to PALIOS-TAEY GitHub repository
- Familiarity with PALIOS-TAEY system architecture and components
- Understanding of the ATLAS framework and NOVA methodology
- Review of Claude-to-Claude documentation format examples in `/docs/claude/`

## Specific Tasks
1. Implement comprehensive documentation restructuring according to audience-aware structure
2. Create automation scripts for document creation and updating
3. Reorganize existing documents into new structure
4. Update cross-references and navigation links
5. Implement documentation verification process
6. Create reusable templates for each document type
7. Document the new structure and processes

## Scope Boundaries
- IN-SCOPE: Documentation restructuring and organization
- IN-SCOPE: Document automation scripts
- IN-SCOPE: Template creation for document types
- IN-SCOPE: Cross-reference updating
- IN-SCOPE: Quality framework documentation implementation
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Content changes beyond format and structure
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Code quality implementation (separate mission)
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: System architecture changes
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Deployment and infrastructure documentation

## Authority Limits
You have authority to:
- Create new document structure
- Move and reformat existing documents
- Create automation scripts
- Establish templates and standards
- Create new Claude-to-Claude format documents

Escalate to CTO Claude if:
- Content changes would alter meaning or functional guidance
- Document restructuring would impact ongoing development
- Quality framework implementation conflicts with existing practices

## Document Structure Implementation

### 1. Audience-Aware Directory Structure
Create the following directory structure:
docs/
├── claude/              # Claude-to-Claude optimized documents
├── ai-ai/               # Cross-model AI documentation
├── framework/           # Core frameworks and methodologies
├── charter/             # Charter and principles
├── protocols/           # Communication and process protocols
├── implementation/      # Technical implementation guides
├── deployment/          # Deployment and operations documentation
├── history/             # Historical records and evolution
└── templates/           # Document templates
Copy
### 2. Document Format Standards
Implement these format standards:
- Claude-to-Claude format for documents in `/docs/claude/`
- Rosetta Stone Protocol for documents in `/docs/ai-ai/`
- Human-readable format with AI headers for other documents

### 3. Document Automation
Create these automation scripts in `/scripts/documentation/`:
- `create_document.sh`: Script to create new documents from templates
- `update_document.sh`: Script to update existing documents
- `verify_document.sh`: Script to verify document format and links
- `reorganize_documents.sh`: Script to implement new structure

## Required Files and Directories
1. `/scripts/documentation/` - Scripts directory
   - `create_document.sh` - Document creation script
   - `update_document.sh` - Document update script
   - `verify_document.sh` - Document verification script
   - `reorganize_documents.sh` - Reorganization script
2. `/docs/templates/` - Templates directory
   - `claude_template.md` - Claude-to-Claude template
   - `ai_ai_template.md` - AI-AI communication template
   - `framework_template.md` - Framework document template
   - `implementation_template.md` - Implementation guide template
3. `/docs/claude/document_structure.md` - Documentation structure guide

## Success Criteria
- All documentation is organized according to audience-aware structure
- Automation scripts are created and functional
- Templates are established for all document types
- Cross-references are updated for consistency
- New structure is documented and explained
- Claude-to-Claude documents follow consistent format
- Documentation process is more efficient and maintainable

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cat` commands for all file creation to prevent formatting issues
- Test automation scripts incrementally before full implementation
- Run verification after each significant change
- Document all automation scripts with clear usage instructions
- Maintain a mapping of old to new document locations
- Create redirects or symlinks for commonly referenced documents
