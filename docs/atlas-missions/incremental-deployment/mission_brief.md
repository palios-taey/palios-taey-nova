# ATLAS Mission Brief: Incremental Deployment of Existing Components

## Mission Context
The PALIOS-TAEY system has been fully developed and tested locally with all seven core modules (api, core, memory, models, routing, tasks, transcripts) functioning correctly. Previous deployment attempts were unsuccessful due to GCP infrastructure configuration issues rather than code problems. Using our successful skeleton deployment as a foundation, we now need to incrementally deploy the existing components without rebuilding them.

## Prerequisites
- Successful skeleton deployment (Mission 1) already completed
- Access to the PALIOS-TAEY GitHub repository with all core modules
- Basic understanding of GCP services
- Understanding of the 6-Sigma quality framework for deployment verification

## Specific Tasks

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification
1. Verify GCP project configuration and permissions
2. Confirm Firestore database is properly configured
3. Validate Cloud Run service account permissions
4. Verify environment variables and configuration
5. Test connectivity to all required services

### Phase 2: Core and Memory System Deployment
1. Deploy the core module for error handling and utilities
2. Configure the memory system with Firestore connections
3. Update the main application to include these components
4. Verify functionality with basic memory operations
5. Document any cloud-specific configuration required

### Phase 3: Models and Routing Deployment
1. Deploy the model registry and routing modules
2. Configure necessary API permissions and connections
3. Implement simplified model interfaces for testing
4. Verify model selection and routing functions
5. Document deployment-specific configuration

### Phase 4: Tasks and Transcripts Deployment
1. Deploy task decomposition and execution engines
2. Integrate transcript processing framework
3. Connect all components through the main application
4. Test full-system functionality with verification tasks
5. Document complete system deployment

### Phase 5: API and Security Implementation
1. Deploy the API layer with all endpoints
2. Implement authentication and security controls
3. Verify API access with proper authentication
4. Document API endpoints and usage
5. Perform final system verification

## Scope Boundaries
- IN-SCOPE: Deploying existing, locally-tested modules
- IN-SCOPE: Configuring GCP environment for proper operation
- IN-SCOPE: Integration testing after deployment
- IN-SCOPE: Resolving deployment-specific configuration issues
- IN-SCOPE: Documentation of deployment process
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Rebuilding or significantly modifying modules
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Adding new functionality beyond what exists
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Changing architecture or component interactions

## Authority Limits
You have authority to:
- Deploy existing modules to GCP
- Configure environment variables and settings
- Create deployment-specific integration code
- Implement necessary security controls
- Document deployment procedures

Escalate to CTO Claude if:
- Significant code modifications are required
- Architecture changes are needed
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Integration issues that cannot be resolved with configuration

## Deployment Strategy

### Pre-Deployment Verification
For each component:
- Verify module dependencies are correctly declared
- Confirm all necessary files are present
- Validate configuration requirements
- Check for any environment-specific code

### Deployment Process
1. Start with minimal deployment of each component
2. Verify basic functionality before proceeding
3. Add complexity incrementally
4. Document each successful step
5. Create verification tests for each component

### Error Handling
Apply the CLAUDE Debugging Protocol for any issues:
1. Comprehensive Logging Review
2. Layer Isolation
3. Assumption Identification & Testing
4. Underlying Dependency Examination
5. Data Flow Tracing
6. Environment Verification

## Required Files and Documentation

### Configuration Files
1. `app.yaml` - App configuration for Cloud Run
2. `.env.cloud` - Environment variables for cloud deployment
3. `firestore.yaml` - Firestore connection configuration

### Verification Scripts
1. `verify_infrastructure.sh` - Infrastructure verification
2. `verify_memory.sh` - Memory system verification
3. `verify_models.sh` - Model registry verification
4. `verify_tasks.sh` - Task system verification
5. `verify_api.sh` - API verification

### Documentation Files
1. `deployment_guide.md` - Complete deployment documentation
2. `verification_procedures.md` - System verification procedures
3. `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions

## Success Criteria
- All seven core modules successfully deployed to GCP
- System passes all verification tests
- API endpoints accessible with proper authentication
- Memory operations functioning correctly
- Model routing and task execution validated
- Complete deployment documentation provided

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on deployment configuration rather than code modification
- Use existing code as-is wherever possible
- Document any environment-specific adaptations required
- Apply verification after each deployment step
- Create detailed deployment guide for future reference
