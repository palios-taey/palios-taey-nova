# ATLAS Mission Brief: Application Configuration (Hybrid Approach)

## Mission Context
Building on our hybrid infrastructure and deployment approach, this mission focuses on configuring the PALIOS-TAEY application for cloud deployment. This involves setting up environment-specific configurations, service connections, and API integrations.

## Prerequisites
- GCP Foundation Infrastructure (Mission 1) completed
- Deployment Pipeline (Mission 2) established
- Access to API integration requirements

## Specific Tasks
1. Create environment configuration files for cloud deployment
2. Configure Firestore connections for the Memory System
3. Set up API integrations with external systems (Claude, Grok Think/DeepSearch)
4. Implement basic health check endpoints
5. Configure application security settings
6. Document all configuration thoroughly
7. Create verification procedures for configuration

## Scope Boundaries
- IN-SCOPE: Application configuration for cloud deployment
- IN-SCOPE: Environment-specific configuration files
- IN-SCOPE: Service connection configuration
- IN-SCOPE: API integration setup
- IN-SCOPE: Basic health check implementation
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Advanced monitoring and logging (can be added later)
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Complex scaling rules
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Modifying core application functionality

## Authority Limits
You have authority to:
- Create all configuration files
- Set up service connections
- Configure health checks
- Establish API integrations
- Define application security settings

Escalate to CTO Claude if:
- Application architecture conflicts with cloud deployment
- Security vulnerabilities in application configuration
- Integration issues with external services

## Required Files and Directories
1. `config/` - Configuration directory
   - `.env.cloud` - Environment variables
   - `firestore.yaml` - Firestore connection
   - `api_integrations.yaml` - External API integration
   - `security.yaml` - Security configuration
2. `src/api/` - API directory
   - `health.py` - Health check implementation
3. `docs/` - Documentation directory
   - `configuration.md` - Configuration documentation
   - `verification.md` - Configuration verification procedures

## Success Criteria
- Application can be deployed with proper configuration
- Memory System successfully connects to Firestore
- API integrations are functional (Claude, Grok Think/DeepSearch)
- Health check accurately reports application status
- Security is properly configured for API access
- All configuration can be verified

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cat` commands for all file creation to prevent formatting issues
- Test configurations with simple verification scripts
- Ensure all sensitive information is properly secured
- Document any configuration challenges for future improvement
- Implement proper error handling for service connections
