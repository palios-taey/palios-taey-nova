# ATLAS Mission Brief: Deployment Pipeline Implementation (Hybrid Approach)

## Mission Context
Following our hybrid approach to GCP infrastructure, this mission focuses on creating a reliable deployment pipeline for the PALIOS-TAEY system. The pipeline will need to work with our manually configured and Terraform-managed infrastructure components.

## Prerequisites
- GCP Foundation Infrastructure (Mission 1) completed
- Access to the PALIOS-TAEY application code repository
- Docker installed for local testing

## Specific Tasks
1. Create Docker containerization for the PALIOS-TAEY application
2. Develop simplified build and deployment scripts
3. Configure Artifact Registry for container storage
4. Create deployment verification procedures
5. Document all deployment steps thoroughly
6. Implement basic CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
7. Create fallback procedures for manual deployment if automation fails

## Scope Boundaries
- IN-SCOPE: Docker containerization of the application
- IN-SCOPE: Basic CI/CD pipeline configuration
- IN-SCOPE: Build and deployment scripts
- IN-SCOPE: Integration with GCP infrastructure from Mission 1
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Complex automation that requires debugging
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Application code modifications
- OUT-OF-SCOPE: Application-specific configuration (Mission 3)

## Authority Limits
You have authority to:
- Define the Docker container configuration
- Create deployment scripts and workflows
- Configure Artifact Registry
- Document deployment procedures

Escalate to CTO Claude if:
- Integration issues with GCP infrastructure arise
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Application architecture conflicts with containerization

## Required Files and Directories
1. `docker/` - Docker configuration directory
   - `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
   - `.dockerignore` - Files to exclude
2. `scripts/` - Deployment scripts directory
   - `build.sh` - Script to build the application
   - `push_image.sh` - Script to push to Artifact Registry
   - `deploy.sh` - Script to deploy to Cloud Run
   - `verify_deployment.sh` - Deployment verification
3. `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions directory
   - `ci-cd.yml` - Basic CI/CD workflow
4. `docs/` - Documentation directory
   - `deployment.md` - Deployment documentation
   - `manual_deployment.md` - Fallback procedures

## Success Criteria
- Application can be containerized and pushed to Artifact Registry
- Deployment to Cloud Run succeeds using the created scripts
- Deployment can be verified automatically
- Documentation covers both automated and manual procedures
- Basic CI/CD workflow executes successfully

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cat` commands for all file creation to prevent formatting issues
- Test each step individually before attempting end-to-end deployment
- Ensure scripts include proper error handling and logging
- Focus on reliability over complexity
- Document any issues encountered for future improvement
