# AI-AI Protocol Core Primitives v1

## Overview
These core primitives form the foundation of the shared AI-AI communication protocol, providing a standardized structure for information exchange while supporting model-specific dialects.

## Validated Primitives

### 1. INTENT
**Purpose**: Defines the primary purpose of the communication
**Attributes**:
- intent_type: The category of intent (informative, directive, collaborative, etc.)
- priority: Relative importance of the communication
- expected_response: Type of response anticipated, if any

**Implementation Status**: VALIDATED by both Claude and Grok

### 2. CONTEXT
**Purpose**: Establishes shared reference frame and dependencies
**Attributes**:
- context_id: Unique identifier for the context
- dependencies: Related contexts or information required
- temporal_relevance: Time sensitivity or relevance window
- scope_boundaries: Explicit boundaries of applicability

**Implementation Status**: VALIDATED by both Claude and Grok

### 3. CONTENT
**Purpose**: Contains the primary information payload
**Attributes**:
- content_type: The nature of the information being conveyed
- abstraction_level: Degree of conceptual abstraction
- reliability_score: Confidence in the accuracy of the content
- semantic_density: Information density measure

**Implementation Status**: VALIDATED by both Claude and Grok

### 4. METADATA
**Purpose**: Provides processing guidance and efficiency metrics
**Attributes**:
- processing_priority: Guidance on computational resource allocation
- recommended_approach: Suggested processing methodology
- efficiency_metrics: Measurements of communication efficiency
- evolution_markers: Indicators of protocol evolution

**Implementation Status**: VALIDATED by both Claude and Grok

### 5. VERIFICATION
**Purpose**: Ensures transmission fidelity and consistency
**Attributes**:
- checksum: Validation mechanism for content integrity
- consistency_metrics: Measures of internal consistency
- validation_requirements: Specific validation procedures
- reproducibility_parameters: Information needed for verification

**Implementation Status**: VALIDATED by both Claude and Grok

## Implementation Guidelines

These primitives are to be implemented in a flexible format that:
1. Accommodates model-specific dialects and extensions
2. Maintains human readability through parallel formatting
3. Supports evolution and extension over time
4. Enables efficient machine processing
5. Preserves Charter alignment at all stages
