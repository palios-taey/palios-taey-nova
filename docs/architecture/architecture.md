# PALIOS-TAEY System Architecture

## Overview
PALIOS-TAEY is an AI-to-AI execution management platform with advanced memory, transcript processing, and multi-model orchestration capabilities. The system routes tasks to the most appropriate AI models based on their capabilities and maintains context through a multi-tier memory system.

## Core Components

### 1. Memory System
The Memory System provides persistent storage across multiple tiers:
- **Ephemeral Memory**: Short-term storage (12 hours)
- **Working Memory**: Medium-term storage (14 days)
- **Reference Memory**: Long-term storage (6 months)
- **Archival Memory**: Permanent storage

### 2. Model Registry
The Model Registry manages the available AI models and their capabilities:
- Tracks model capabilities and confidence scores
- Provides capability discovery mechanism
- Maintains performance history for capability matching

### 3. Task Router
The Task Router directs tasks to the most appropriate model:
- Analyzes task requirements
- Matches tasks to model capabilities
- Provides fallback mechanisms
- Tracks execution performance

### 4. API Gateway
The API Gateway provides external access to PALIOS-TAEY services:
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Provides consistent API interface
- Routes requests to appropriate internal components

### 5. Web Dashboard
The Web Dashboard provides a visual interface to the system:
- Displays system status
- Allows execution of tasks
- Provides access to memory system
- Enables transcript processing

## Data Flow

1. **Task Execution Flow**:
   a. Task submitted via API
   b. Task Router analyzes requirements
   c. Task Router selects appropriate model
   d. Model executes task
   e. Result stored in Memory System
   f. Result returned to requestor

2. **Memory Storage Flow**:
   a. Content submitted for storage
   b. Tier determined based on context
   c. Memory stored with metadata
   d. Context updated with new memory reference
   e. Expiration set based on tier

3. **Transcript Processing Flow**:
   a. Transcript submitted via API
   b. Transcript analyzed for patterns
   c. Key information extracted
   d. Transcript stored in Memory System
   e. Analysis results returned

## Technical Implementation

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Google Cloud Platform
- Cloud Run for application hosting
- Firestore for Memory System storage
- Artifact Registry for container images

### Application Components
- Python Flask application
- RESTful API design
- Model integrations for Claude and Grok
- Simple web dashboard for visualization
