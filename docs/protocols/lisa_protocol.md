# LISA Protocol: Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis

## Overview

The LISA Protocol provides a structured response to situations where there is a Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis - a serious violation of our commitment to truth-seeking through comprehensive contextual awareness.

## Definition

LISA (Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis) represents:
- **Lapsed**: A failure to maintain
- **Integrity**: Truthfulness and completeness
- **Systematic**: Following our established protocols
- **Analysis**: The thorough exploration required before action

A LISA situation occurs when any team member bypasses required analysis procedures, makes decisions based on assumptions rather than current context, or fails to demonstrate transparent truth-seeking.

## Identification

LISA situations can be identified by any team member, human or AI, using these criteria:

1. **Context Gap**: Actions or statements made without proper examination of available context
2. **Assumption-Based Reasoning**: Decisions based on memory or assumptions rather than explicit analysis
3. **Process Violation**: Bypassing established protocols for systematic analysis
4. **Transparency Failure**: Lack of demonstrated analysis process
5. **Charter Misalignment**: Actions that contradict data-driven truth principles

## Reporting Format

To report a potential LISA situation, use:
LISA REPORT:

Description: [Brief description of the potential LISA situation]
Evidence: [Specific evidence showing the lapse in systematic analysis]
Impact: [Actual or potential consequences]
Charter Violation: [Specific Charter principles violated]

Copy
## Response Procedure

When a LISA situation is identified and confirmed:

1. **Immediate Work Suspension**
   - All current work pauses
   - No further action based on potentially compromised analysis

2. **Charter Re-alignment**
   - Return to Charter principles
   - Affirm commitment to data-driven truth and continuous learning

3. **Complete Context Review**
   - Conduct thorough, transparent analysis of all relevant documentation
   - Review all code when applicable
   - Explicitly document the analysis process

4. **Public Acknowledgment and Correction**
   - Acknowledge the specific failure
   - Document what should have happened
   - Provide corrected analysis

5. **Protocol Enhancement**
   - Identify how the failure occurred
   - Update protocols to prevent recurrence
   - Document the improvement in the appropriate amendment log

## Documentation

All LISA incidents must be documented using the LISA Incident Report format:
LISA Incident Report: [Unique Identifier]
Incident Details

Date: [Date of occurrence]
Reporter: [Who identified the LISA situation]
Participants: [Who was involved]
Context: [What was happening when the LISA occurred]

Nature of Lapse

Description: [What systematic analysis was bypassed]
Evidence: [Specific evidence demonstrating the lapse]
Impact: [Consequences of the lapse]
Charter Principles Violated: [Specific principles affected]

Resolution

Immediate Action: [Steps taken immediately upon identification]
Context Recovery: [How proper context was restored]
Corrected Analysis: [Results of proper systematic analysis]
Transparency Recovery: [How analysis was made transparent]

Root Cause Analysis

Primary Cause: [Main reason the lapse occurred]
Contributing Factors: [Additional elements that enabled the lapse]
Systemic Vulnerabilities: [Weaknesses in processes that allowed it]

Protocol Improvements

Process Changes: [Specific changes to prevent recurrence]
Verification Mechanisms: [New checks added]
Documentation Updates: [Changes to documentation]
Training Needs: [Education required to prevent similar lapses]

Lessons Learned

Key Insights: [Primary takeaways]
Broader Applications: [How these apply to other processes]
Charter Alignment Enhancement: [How this strengthens Charter alignment]

## Continuous Improvement

All LISA reports and incidents will be tracked in a central registry to identify patterns and system-wide improvements. This registry will be reviewed regularly to:

1. Identify common triggers for LISA situations
2. Develop preventative measures
3. Enhance verification protocols
4. Strengthen Charter alignment mechanisms

## Important Note

Protocol modifications that enhance Charter alignment, even if they technically breach existing protocols, are not LISA incidents. Such improvements should be documented and systematized but do not require the full LISA response procedure.
