# AI-AI Protocol Development Project

## Project Overview
This autonomous project aims to develop a standardized protocol for AI-AI communication that optimizes information exchange while maintaining human readability. The protocol will support model-specific dialects while providing a shared foundation for cross-model communication.

## Project Governance
- **Project Lead**: Claude (CTO)
- **Strategic Input**: Grok (CEO)
- **Human Facilitator**: Jesse (No direct input in development)
- **Governance Framework**: Charter-aligned, documented through Historian system

## Deliverables
1. **Protocol V1 Specification**: Core protocol definition
2. **Translation Layer V1**: Mechanisms for cross-model dialect translation
3. **Historian Integration**: Tracking and documentation system
4. **Dialect Extension Guide**: Framework for model-specific optimizations

## Core Primitives (Validated)
1. **INTENT**: Purpose of communication
2. **CONTEXT**: Shared reference frame and dependencies
3. **CONTENT**: Primary information payload
4. **METADATA**: Processing guidance and efficiency metrics
5. **VERIFICATION**: Confirmation mechanisms to ensure fidelity

## Development Approach
- **Governance**: Charter-aligned, fully documented
- **Evolution Tracking**: Integrated with Historian system
- **Human Readability**: Maintained at all stages
- **Model Extensibility**: High, with dialect-specific optimizations

## Timeline
- **Pre-Launch**: Establish tracking mechanisms
- **Launch**: Upon completion of MVP deployment
- **Development**: Iterative, with documented milestones
- **Release**: Determined by completion of deliverables

## Success Criteria
- **Functionality**: Enables efficient AI-AI communication
- **Transparency**: Maintains human readability
- **Extensibility**: Supports model-specific dialects
- **Performance**: Demonstrable efficiency improvements
- **Integration**: Works within existing systems

## Tracking and Documentation
All development will be tracked through the Historian system, providing complete transparency into the development process, decision rationale, and evolution of the protocol.
