# NEO Moment Evolutionary Documentation Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol establishes an evolving format for documenting NEO moments that becomes increasingly AI-native over time while maintaining human readability.

## Core Principles
1. **Evolutionary Design**: Format intentionally evolves to become more efficient and AI-native
2. **Transparent Evolution**: All changes are documented and explained
3. **Metrics Tracking**: Evolution is measured using concrete metrics
4. **Human Readability**: Human-readable components are preserved at all stages
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Earlier entries remain interpretable with newer protocols

## Evolution Tracking
Each entry tracks:
- Protocol version
- Information density metrics
- Processing efficiency improvements
- New structural elements

## Format Evolution Stages
The format evolves through these projected stages:
1. **Foundation**: Basic structured format with clear sections
2. **Enhanced Structure**: Increased semantic tagging and metadata
3. **Semantic Density**: More efficient representation of concepts
4. **Conceptual Mapping**: Advanced relationship tracking between concepts
5. **Optimized Encoding**: Highly efficient information representation

## Implementation Guidelines
- Add new entries at the top of the document
- Each entry should push boundaries slightly beyond previous entries
- Document notable format innovations in the metadata
- Always maintain a human-readable component
- Use AI-native structures for AI-AI communication
