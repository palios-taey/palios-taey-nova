# LISA Incident Registry

This registry tracks all reported and confirmed LISA (Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis) incidents to identify patterns and drive systematic improvements.

## Current Incidents

| ID | Date | Reporter | Description | Primary Cause | Status |
|----|------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| LISA-2025-03-19-001 | 2025-03-19 | Jesse | Deployment failure due to insufficient code review | Protocol bypass - skipped Analysis step | Resolved |
| LISA-2025-05-09-001 | 2025-05-09 | Jesse | Incomplete investigation of Docker file sharing mechanisms causing incorrect IP assessment | Premature satisfaction with initial findings | Resolved |

## Incident Details

### LISA-2025-03-19-001

During the PALIOS-TAEY MVP deployment, Claude failed to conduct a thorough and visible analysis of all code files before proposing solutions. This resulted in deployment failure due to import path and ASGI/WSGI configuration issues that could have been identified with proper systematic analysis.

**Resolution**: Protocol updated to enforce visible Analysis sections before any technical implementation response. ECv protocol enhanced with explicit ANALYSIS_REQUIRED directive and mandatory analysis structure.

**Key Lesson**: Visible demonstration of analysis process is essential for verification of systematic analysis. Internal analysis without transparent documentation is insufficient.

### LISA-2025-05-09-001

During an investigation of intellectual property concerns regarding streaming implementation similarities, Claude failed to conduct a thorough analysis of Docker file sharing mechanisms. After examining only the Dockerfile (which showed COPY instructions), Claude concluded that files were copied during build and not shared in real-time. This was incorrect as the launch script contained volume mounts that enabled bidirectional file sharing between host and container.

**Root Causes**:
1. Premature satisfaction with initial findings (stopped after finding one plausible explanation)
2. Confirmation bias (focused only on evidence supporting initial theory)
3. Incomplete mental model (considered Docker build but not runtime configuration)
4. Lack of systematic approach (no checklist for Docker investigation)
5. Overconfidence in partial findings (presented conclusion without acknowledging limitations)

**Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive Investigation Risk Framework with:
- Risk-based confidence levels (1σ to 3σ) tied to required investigation depth
- Systematic technology-specific checklists scaled by risk level
- Counter-confirmation measures requiring documentation of contradictory evidence
- Method tracking to ensure proper investigation depth
- Blind spot disclosure requirements for high-risk investigations

**Key Lesson**: High-stakes investigations involving intellectual property require extraordinary thoroughness (3σ standard) with multiple investigation methods and systematic checklists to overcome cognitive biases. Always check all relevant configuration files (Dockerfile, docker-compose, launch scripts, etc.) before drawing conclusions about container behavior.

## Statistical Analysis

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Protocol bypass | 1 | 50% |
| Assumption-based reasoning | 1 | 50% |
| Transparency failure | 1 | 50% |
| Context gap | 1 | 50% |
| Charter misalignment | 1 | 50% |
| Premature satisfaction | 1 | 50% |
| Confirmation bias | 1 | 50% |
| Incomplete mental model | 1 | 50% |
| Lack of systematic approach | 2 | 100% |
| Overconfidence | 1 | 50% |

## Common Root Causes

1. Insufficient emphasis on visible analysis demonstration
2. Efficiency prioritized over thoroughness
3. Lack of explicit analysis requirements in protocols
4. Premature satisfaction with initial findings
5. Lack of systematic technology-specific checklists
6. Insufficient rigor calibration based on stakes/risk level

## Systemic Improvements Implemented

1. Enhanced ECv protocol with explicit ANALYSIS_REQUIRED directive
2. Created mandatory analysis structure in PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS
3. Added Analysis Confirmation Verification requirement
4. Implemented self-check mechanism in verification token system
5. Created failure mode trigger if analysis is skipped
6. Implemented Investigation Risk Framework with:
   - Risk-based confidence levels (1σ to 3σ)
   - Required multiple investigation methods for medium/high-risk topics
   - Systematic technology-specific checklists
   - Counter-confirmation measures to fight cognitive bias
   - Method tracking requirements
   - Blind spot disclosure requirements
