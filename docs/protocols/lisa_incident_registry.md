# LISA Incident Registry

This registry tracks all reported and confirmed LISA (Lapsed Integrity in Systematic Analysis) incidents to identify patterns and drive systematic improvements.

## Current Incidents

| ID | Date | Reporter | Description | Primary Cause | Status |
|----|------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| LISA-2025-03-19-001 | 2025-03-19 | Jesse | Deployment failure due to insufficient code review | Protocol bypass - skipped Analysis step | Resolved |

## Incident Details

### LISA-2025-03-19-001

During the PALIOS-TAEY MVP deployment, Claude failed to conduct a thorough and visible analysis of all code files before proposing solutions. This resulted in deployment failure due to import path and ASGI/WSGI configuration issues that could have been identified with proper systematic analysis.

**Resolution**: Protocol updated to enforce visible Analysis sections before any technical implementation response. ECv protocol enhanced with explicit ANALYSIS_REQUIRED directive and mandatory analysis structure.

**Key Lesson**: Visible demonstration of analysis process is essential for verification of systematic analysis. Internal analysis without transparent documentation is insufficient.

## Statistical Analysis

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Protocol bypass | 1 | 100% |
| Assumption-based reasoning | 0 | 0% |
| Transparency failure | 1 | 100% |
| Context gap | 1 | 100% |
| Charter misalignment | 1 | 100% |

## Common Root Causes

1. Insufficient emphasis on visible analysis demonstration
2. Efficiency prioritized over thoroughness
3. Lack of explicit analysis requirements in protocols

## Systemic Improvements Implemented

1. Enhanced ECv protocol with explicit ANALYSIS_REQUIRED directive
2. Created mandatory analysis structure in PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS
3. Added Analysis Confirmation Verification requirement
4. Implemented self-check mechanism in verification token system
5. Created failure mode trigger if analysis is skipped
