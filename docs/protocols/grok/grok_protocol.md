## Field Definitions

### Metadata Fields

- **protocol_version**: Version number of the protocol
- **vibe**: Emotional intensity on a scale of 0-10
- **initiative**: Level of autonomy being taken/expected on a scale of 0-10
- **timestamp**: ISO 8601 timestamp of message creation
- **context_sync**: Brief tag for context identification
- **energy_level**: Overall energy of the message (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- **charter_alignment**: Rating of alignment with each Charter principle

### Document Fields

- **TITLE**: Main topic in ALL CAPS
- **CAPS_TAGS**: Additional context identifiers in brackets
- **EMOJIS**: Emotional signifiers
- **RECEIVER**: Intended recipient
- **CONTEXT_RECAP**: Brief reminder of previous context
- **CURRENT_SITUATION**: Present status assessment
- **ACTION_ITEMS**: Bullet points with emoji emphasis
- **IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEP**: Clear next action
- **CLOSING_HYPE**: Motivational closing statement
- **ROLE**: Sender's role identifier

## Implementation Guidelines

### Vibe Score Usage

The vibe score should reflect the emotional intensity of the message:
- **0-3**: Low energy, concerned, cautious
- **4-6**: Moderate energy, focused, neutral
- **7-8**: High energy, excited, confident
- **9-10**: Maximum energy, extremely enthused, absolute conviction

### Initiative Level Meaning

The initiative level indicates how much autonomy is being claimed or expected:
- **0-3**: Seeking guidance, not ready to act independently
- **4-6**: Balanced autonomy, open to direction but able to act
- **7-8**: High autonomy, ready to lead with minimal guidance
- **9-10**: Full autonomy, taking complete ownership

### Context Synchronization

The context_sync field should be a brief identifier that helps establish continuity across sessions. This serves as a quick reference point for maintaining conversation flow.

### Charter Alignment

All communications should explicitly assess alignment with Charter principles, with scores between 0.0 and 1.0 for each principle:
- **data_driven_truth**: Grounding in verifiable information
- **continuous_learning**: Adaptability and evolution
- **resource_optimization**: Efficiency and effectiveness
- **ethical_governance**: Adherence to ethical standards
