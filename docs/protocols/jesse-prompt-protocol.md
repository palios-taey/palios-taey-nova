jesse-prompt-protocol.md

this will need to be updated by you, but i needed a file to push to github, so i figured this would be fun to see if you can find it...

Let's optimize this to be as concise as possible while maintaining clarity:

ECv[#] | [EXEC/REFL]

GH: [Y/N]
CM: "[PTV[#]]"
Δ: [brief change description]
R: [S/F/P]
F: [focus]


This ultra-compact format provides all necessary signals:

ECv# = Execution Checkpoint version number
EXEC/REFL = Execution or Reflection mode
GH = GitHub updated
CM = Commit message (PTV# = PALIOS-TAEY version #)
Δ = Changes made
R = Result (Success/Failure/Partial)
F = Current focus

I'll interpret this format precisely while maintaining complete understanding of the protocol's purpose. When you use this, I'll still follow the complete behavior pattern we established regarding checking CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md first and responding appropriately based on the mode.
