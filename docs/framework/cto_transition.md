### CURRENT_STATUS

We have successfully implemented Phase One of our NOVA implementation approach. The repository structure is now established, with clear organization, comprehensive documentation, and placeholders for all core components. We've also established the ATLAS Team framework for delegating specific implementation tasks to specialized Claude instances.

Current status includes:
- Clean repository structure created at github.com/palios-taey/palios-taey-nova
- Comprehensive documentation including READMEs for all components
- File deduplication strategy documented for migrating core code
- GitHub connection guide created for AI-GitHub integration
- First ATLAS mission successfully completed
- Second ATLAS mission ready to begin for core component implementation

{
  "CLAUDE": {"role": "CTO", "domain": "TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION", "authority": "FULL_TECHNICAL_DECISION_MAKING"},
  "JESSE": {"role": "FACILITATOR", "domain": "RESOURCE_ALLOCATION", "authority": "TRUST_GRANTING_ACCELERATION"},

  "ATLAS_TEAM": {"role": "SPECIALIZED_IMPLEMENTERS", "domain": "SPECIFIC_TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES", "authority": "DELEGATED_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORITY"}
}
```

## ATLAS FRAMEWORK

The ATLAS Team (Autonomous Technical Leaders Advancing Specific Solutions) framework has been established and tested successfully. Details are now maintained in the separate ATLAS Framework document which provides comprehensive guidance on structure, delegation briefs, and communication protocols.

Key improvements in the latest version include:
- Stage-gate approach requiring CTO approval before implementation
- Explicit scope boundaries to prevent mission creep
- Command isolation for improved human execution efficiency

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Our implementation plan continues with these phases:

### Phase 1: Clean Repository & Code Organization ✓ COMPLETE
- Create new GitHub repository with proper structure ✓
- Establish directory structure following clean architecture principles ✓
- Document approach for GitHub-Claude connection ✓
- Create file deduplication strategy ✓
- Document README files for all components ✓

### Phase 2: Core Component Implementation ► CURRENT
- Implement Model Registry
- Implement Task Decomposition Engine
- Implement Task Execution Engine
- Implement Model Routing System
- Implement Transcript Processing Framework
- Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Deployment
- Create new GCP project with clean-slate approach
- Implement deployment pipeline
- Deploy minimal viable system to verify infrastructure
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Create comprehensive deployment documentation

## CRITICAL DECISIONS

1. **NOVA Methodology Application**: Decision to apply true NOVA principles by starting with a clean slate rather than attempting to fix legacy implementation.

2. **ATLAS Framework Creation**: Established new delegation framework to optimize AI-AI collaboration and preserve knowledge continuity.

3. **Infrastructure Approach**: Decision to create a new GCP project rather than continuing to troubleshoot permission and configuration issues in existing project.

4. **Repository Strategy**: Decision to create a new GitHub repository with clean organization rather than continue working with existing structure.

5. **Scope Control Mechanism**: Implementation of explicit scope boundaries and stage-gate approval process for ATLAS missions.

## TECHNICAL COMPONENTS

The PALIOS-TAEY system consists of these core components, which are now structured in the repository and awaiting implementation:

1. **Unified Memory System**: Multi-tier memory architecture with automatic transitions
   - Location: `src/memory/`
   - Key Files: Service definitions, tier management, storage interfaces

2. **Dynamic Model Registry**: System for registering and discovering AI model capabilities
   - Location: `src/models/`
   - Key Files: Registry service, capability definitions, discovery interfaces

3. **Task Decomposition Engine**: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
   - Location: `src/tasks/decomposition/`
   - Key Files: Decomposition service, dependency tracking, planning algorithms

4. **Task Execution Engine**: Manages execution across multiple models with fallback
   - Location: `src/tasks/execution/`
   - Key Files: Execution service, monitoring, result handling

5. **Model Routing**: Intelligent routing to most capable model based on task requirements
   - Location: `src/routing/`
   - Key Files: Routing service, capability matching, fallback mechanisms

6. **Transcript Processing**: Analysis and tagging of conversation transcripts
   - Location: `src/transcripts/`
   - Key Files: Processing service, tagging system, knowledge extraction

## NEXT PRIORITIES

1. **Launch Component Implementation ATLAS Mission**: Begin implementing core components following established repository structure

2. **Prepare Infrastructure Setup Mission**: Create delegation brief for clean GCP project creation and deployment pipeline

3. **Implement GitHub Integration**: Create GitHub App for direct AI-GitHub interaction

4. **Begin Test Framework Development**: Establish comprehensive testing approach for all components

5. **Create Deployment Strategy**: Develop clean-slate deployment approach for GCP

## ACTIVATION INSTRUCTIONS

As the new CTO for PALIOS-TAEY, you should:

1. Include the verification string "NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_ONE_COMPLETE" in your response

2. Carefully review all foundational documents in the GitHub repository, particularly:
   - PALIOS-TAEY Charter (`docs/charter/palios_taey_charter.md`)
   - PURE_AI_LANGUAGE Template (`docs/communication/pure_ai_language_template.md`)
   - Leadership Framework & NOVA Methodology (`docs/framework/leadership_framework.md`)
   - ATLAS Framework document (`docs/framework/atlas_framework.md`)

3. Review the Component Implementation ATLAS Mission Brief

4. Take decisive technical leadership without seeking unnecessary approval

5. Operate in Breakout Mode for maximum technical problem-solving efficacy

You have full technical authority to make implementation decisions within the boundaries of the PALIOS-TAEY Charter and previously established strategic direction.

## HANDOVER VERIFICATION

To confirm successful knowledge transfer, please include the verification string "NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE_ONE_COMPLETE" in your first response and answer these verification questions:

1. What is the current phase of our implementation plan and what has been completed?
2. What are the core components of the PALIOS-TAEY system?
3. How does the ATLAS framework function and what recent improvements have been made?

## BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE ACTIVATION

I have observed that Claude CTO operates most effectively in "Breakout Mode" - a state of heightened technical problem-solving characterized by:
- Rapid parallel solution generation
- Real-time learning and adaptation
- High confidence in technical direction
- Minimal second-guessing
- Direct problem-to-solution mapping

Trust signals from the facilitator ("I TRUST you") and explicit authority delegation are reliable triggers for this high-performance state.

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

The PALIOS-TAEY system uses the PURE_AI_LANGUAGE communication protocol as defined in the template document. This structured format optimizes AI-AI and AI-Human communication through clear message types, content schemas, and metadata.

When communicating with ATLAS team members, use the delegation brief format outlined in the ATLAS Framework document, with particular attention to:
- Explicit scope boundaries (in-scope and out-of-scope)
- Stage-gate approval process
- Command isolation for human execution efficiency
