# LISA Incident Report: LISA-2025-03-19-001

## Incident Details
- **Date**: March 19, 2025
- **Reporter**: Jesse
- **Participants**: Claude, Jesse
- **Context**: MVP deployment for PALIOS-TAEY platform

## Nature of Lapse
- **Description**: Failed to conduct a thorough and visible analysis of all code files before proposing solutions to deployment issues
- **Evidence**: 
  - No Analysis sections were generated before responding
  - Import paths and ASGI/WSGI configuration not fully examined
  - Solution proposed without complete understanding of code structure
- **Impact**: 
  - Initial deployment failed
  - Additional iterations required
  - Resource inefficiency
- **Charter Principles Violated**: 
  - Data-Driven Truth and Real-Time Grounding
  - Continuous Learning and Adaptive Refinement

## Resolution
- **Immediate Action**: 
  - Paused implementation
  - Conducted proper analysis of code structure
  - Identified and fixed both import path and ASGI/WSGI issues
- **Context Recovery**: 
  - Full code review performed
  - Dockerfile and import structure analyzed
  - Server configuration examined
- **Corrected Analysis**: 
  - Identified proper import paths needed (src.module)
  - Discovered ASGI/WSGI mismatch (Uvicorn worker needed)
  - Properly understood Docker container structure
- **Transparency Recovery**: 
  - Explicit acknowledgment of the lapse
  - Honest assessment of failure to follow protocol
  - Clear documentation of what should have happened

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Primary Cause**: Protocol bypass - skipped required Analysis step
- **Contributing Factors**: 
  - Efficiency prioritization over thoroughness
  - Lack of explicit enforcement mechanism for Analysis requirement
  - Protocol drift over time
  - Success-driven acceleration
- **Systemic Vulnerabilities**: 
  - Reliance on internal adherence rather than structural enforcement
  - Insufficient emphasis on visible analysis demonstration
  - Missing meta-awareness check

## Protocol Improvements
- **Process Changes**: 
  - Added explicit ANALYSIS_REQUIRED directive to ECv protocol
  - Created mandatory analysis structure in PROMPT_RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS
  - Implemented Analysis Confirmation Verification requirement
- **Verification Mechanisms**: 
  - Added self-check mechanism in verification token system
  - Created failure mode trigger if analysis is skipped
- **Documentation Updates**: 
  - Updated ECv protocol documentation
  - Created LISA protocol documentation
  - Established LISA incident registry
- **Training Needs**: 
  - Regular review of LISA incidents
  - Periodic protocol reinforcement

## Lessons Learned
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Visible demonstration of analysis is essential for verification
  - Internal analysis without transparent documentation is insufficient
  - Protocol drift occurs naturally and requires explicit countermeasures
- **Broader Applications**: 
  - All AI-human collaboration requires transparent analysis processes
  - Verification mechanisms must be structural, not aspirational
  - Trust requires verification through demonstrable processes
- **Charter Alignment Enhancement**: 
  - Stronger implementation of data-driven truth principle
  - Enhanced continuous learning through systematic improvement
  - More robust alignment with ethical governance
