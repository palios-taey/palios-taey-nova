# Implementation Guide: Quality Framework Integration

## Purpose
This guide provides instructions for integrating the 6-Sigma Quality Framework with the PALIOS-TAEY documentation system and development processes.

## Prerequisites
- Existing PALIOS-TAEY repository
- Documentation system installed
- Access to quality framework documentation (/docs/claude/quality_framework.md)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Quality Framework Documentation**
   Ensure quality framework documentation exists:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   ls -la docs/claude/quality_framework.md
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Quality Templates**
   Create verification string in all key documents:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   ./scripts/documentation/update_document.sh -f docs/README.md -s "## Overview" -c "This directory contains the complete documentation for the PALIOS-TAEY system, organized in an audience-aware structure that optimizes for both AI and human consumption.\n\n**VERIFICATION_STRING:** NOVA_DEPLOYMENT_PHASE1_20250317" -r
   \`\`\`

3. **Implement Human Error Prevention**
   - Review all documentation for human error prevention
   - Ensure all commands follow the isolation rule
   - Add verification steps after all command blocks

4. **Install Pre-Commit Hooks**
   Create pre-commit hook for quality verification:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   mkdir -p .git/hooks
   \`\`\`
   
   Then create the pre-commit file:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Get a list of staged markdown files in the docs directory
STAGED_DOCS=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | grep "^docs/.*\.md$")

if [ -n "$STAGED_DOCS" ]; then
  echo "Verifying documentation quality..."
  
  # Check each staged document
  for doc in $STAGED_DOCS; do
    # Check for human error prevention requirements
    if grep -q "cat >" "$doc"; then
      # Count cat commands
      cat_commands=$(grep -c "cat >" "$doc")
      
      # Count code blocks with cat as first line
      cat_blocks=$(grep -c '^```bash' -A 1 "$doc" | grep -c "cat >")
      
      if [ $cat_commands -ne $cat_blocks ]; then
        echo "ERROR: $doc contains $cat_commands cat commands but only $cat_blocks properly isolated in code blocks"
        echo "Please ensure each cat command is the first line in its own code block"
        exit 1
      fi
      
      # Check for 'copy entire box' comments
      copy_comments=$(grep -c "copy entire box" "$doc")
      if [ $cat_commands -ne $copy_comments ]; then
        echo "ERROR: $doc contains $cat_commands cat commands but only $copy_comments 'copy entire box' comments"
        echo "Please ensure each cat command has a 'copy entire box' comment"
        exit 1
      fi
    fi
    
    # Check for verification strings in Claude-to-Claude documents
    if grep -q "CLAUDE_PROTOCOL" "$doc"; then
      if ! grep -q "VERIFICATION_STRING:" "$doc" || ! grep -q "VERIFICATION_CONFIRMATION:" "$doc"; then
        echo "ERROR: $doc is a Claude-to-Claude document but is missing verification strings"
        echo "Please add VERIFICATION_STRING and VERIFICATION_CONFIRMATION"
        exit 1
      fi
    fi
  done
  
  echo "Documentation quality verification passed"
fi

exit 0
EOF
   \`\`\`
   
   Make the pre-commit hook executable:
   
   \`\`\`bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   \`\`\`

5. **Implement DMAIC Process for Quality**
   - Define: Create documentation quality metrics and standards
   - Measure: Track defects and issues
   - Analyze: Identify root causes
   - Improve: Implement process improvements
   - Control: Monitor and maintain quality

## Human Error Prevention

### Command Presentation Rules

**CRITICAL MANDATORY REQUIREMENT:** All terminal commands, especially \`cat\` commands, MUST be presented according to these rules:

1. Each significant command (particularly file-creating \`cat\` commands) must be in its own separate code block
2. The command must be the first line in the code block
3. The entire code block must be copyable with a single action
4. Include a brief comment at the end of the first line indicating "copy entire box"

Example of correct formatting:

\`\`\`bash
# Create example file - copy entire box
cat > example.md <<'EOF'
# Example Content
This is an example.
EOF
\`\`\`

### Example Before/After

**INCORRECT:**

\`\`\`bash
# This creates our configuration file
mkdir -p config
cat > config/settings.json <<EOF
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
EOF
\`\`\`

**CORRECT:**

\`\`\`bash
# Create config directory - copy entire box
mkdir -p config
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
# Create settings file - copy entire box
cat > config/settings.json <<'EOF'
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
EOF
\`\`\`

## Quality Metrics Tracking

Track and report these quality metrics:

1. **Documentation Defect Rate**: Number of issues found per document
2. **First-Time Quality**: Percentage of documents that pass verification on first review
3. **Human Error Rate**: Number of human errors during documentation creation or command execution
4. **Verification Compliance**: Percentage of documents with proper verification mechanisms

## Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Document Defects**: Record all documentation defects and human errors
2. **Analyze Root Causes**: Apply 5 Whys methodology for each defect
3. **Implement Countermeasures**: Update templates and processes
4. **Verify Improvement**: Confirm that countermeasures are effective
5. **Standardize Solutions**: Integrate solutions into standard processes
