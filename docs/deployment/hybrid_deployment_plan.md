# PALIOS-TAEY Hybrid Deployment Plan

This document outlines our hybrid deployment strategy, balancing local development with cloud deployment as we migrate between development environments.

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Development Mode**
   - Utilizes our local Python environment
   - Fast iteration for feature development
   - Command: `./deploy_hybrid.sh --mode local`

2. **Docker Container Mode**
   - Runs the application in a container
   - Matches production environment more closely
   - Command: `./deploy_hybrid.sh --mode docker`

3. **Cloud Deployment Mode**
   - Deploys to Google Cloud Run
   - Full production environment
   - Command: `./deploy_hybrid.sh --mode cloud`

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MacBook Development (Current)
- Use local mode for rapid development
- Docker mode for testing deployment configurations
- Periodic cloud deployment attempts

### Phase 2: System76 Ubuntu Transition (When hardware arrives)
- Mirror environment setup on Ubuntu
- Use Docker to ensure consistent environment
- Continue cloud deployment

### Phase 3: Full Cloud Deployment
- Complete transition to cloud infrastructure
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Establish monitoring and logging

## Maintaining System Integrity

- All code changes should be tested in local mode first
- Docker containers ensure consistent environment across machines
- Documentation is updated with each significant change
