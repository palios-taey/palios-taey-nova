# Minimum Viable Deployment Strategy

## Core Philosophy
Focus exclusively on getting the system functional in the cloud with minimal infrastructure complexity.

## Simplified Approach
1. **Use Existing Project**: Work with the already-created project rather than creating new ones
2. **Manual Component Creation**: Directly create critical components through GCP Console where permissions are problematic
3. **Essential-Only Services**: Deploy only services absolutely required for basic functionality
4. **Documentation Focus**: Document all manual steps in detail for future automation

## Essential Components Only
- Firestore Database
- Cloud Run Service
- Basic IAM Permissions
- Container Registry

## Manual Setup Documentation
For each component, document:
- Exact console navigation path
- Screenshots of critical configurations
- Configuration values used
- Verification steps
