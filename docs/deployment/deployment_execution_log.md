# Deployment Execution Log

This document serves both as an implementation guide and a historical record of deployment decisions, challenges, and solutions.

## Execution Log Format

Each deployment step should be logged using this format:

```
## [TIMESTAMP] - [ACTION_TITLE]

**Action**: [WHAT_WAS_DONE]
**Context**: [WHY_THIS_APPROACH_WAS_CHOSEN]
**Result**: [OUTCOME]
**Challenges**: [ISSUES_ENCOUNTERED]
**Solutions**: [HOW_CHALLENGES_WERE_ADDRESSED]
**Pattern Recognition**: [PATTERNS_OBSERVED]
**Charter Alignment**: [HOW_THIS_CONNECTS_TO_CHARTER]
```

## Initial Deployment Log

### 2025-03-14 - Project Setup and Environment Configuration

**Action**: Created GCP project and configured environment
**Context**: Needed a clean foundation for PALIOS-TAEY deployment
**Result**: Successfully established project "palios-taey-dev"
**Challenges**: 
- Permission management between personal account and organization
- API enablement dependencies not clearly documented
**Solutions**: 
- Manually enabled APIs through console before attempting automation
- Used personal account with organization admin privileges
**Pattern Recognition**: 
- Initial setup requires higher permission levels than ongoing maintenance
- Authentication context must be explicitly managed between sessions
**Charter Alignment**: 
- Data-Driven Truth: Documented actual requirements rather than assumed ones
- Continuous Learning: Adapted approach based on observed challenges
